abstract = {We quantify the gas-phase abundance of deuterium and fractional contribution of stellar mass loss to the gas in cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback In Realistic Environments project. At low metallicity, our simulations confirm that the deuterium abundance is very close to the primordial value. The chemical evolution of the deuterium abundance that we derive here agrees quantitatively with analytical chemical evolution models. We furthermore find that the relation between the deuterium and oxygen abundance exhibits very little scatter. We compare our simulations to existing high-redshift observations in order to determine a primordial deuterium fraction of 2.549 +/- 0.033 x 10{\^{}}-5 and stress that future observations at higher metallicity can also be used to constrain this value. At fixed metallicity, the deuterium fraction decreases slightly with decreasing redshift, due to the increased importance of mass loss from intermediate-mass stars. We find that the evolution of the average deuterium fraction in a galaxy correlates with its star formation history. Our simulations are consistent with observations of the Milky Way's interstellar medium: the deuterium fraction at the solar circle is 85-92 per cent of the primordial deuterium fraction. We use our simulations to make predictions for future observations. In particular, the deuterium abundance is lower at smaller galactocentric radii and in higher mass galaxies, showing that stellar mass loss is more important for fuelling star formation in these regimes (and can even dominate). Gas accreting onto galaxies has a deuterium fraction above that of the galaxies' interstellar medium, but below the primordial fraction, because it is a mix of gas accreting from the intergalactic medium and gas previously ejected or stripped from galaxies.},

abstract = {Large OVI columns are observed around star-forming, low-redshift {\~{}}L* galaxies, with a dependence on impact parameter indicating that most O{\^{}}5+ particles reside beyond half the halo virial radius ({\textgreater}{\~{}}100 kpc). In order to constrain the nature of the gas traced by OVI, we analyze additional observables of the outer halo, namely HI to OVI column ratios of 1-10, an absence of low-ion absorption, a mean differential extinction of E(B-V){\~{}}10{\^{}}-3, and a linear relation between OVI column and velocity width. We contrast these observations with two physical scenarios: (1) OVI traces high-pressure ({\~{}}30 cm{\^{}}-3 K) collisionally-ionized gas cooling from a virially-shocked phase, and (2) OVI traces low-pressure ({\textless}{\~{}}1 cm{\^{}}-3 K) gas beyond the accretion shock, where the gas is in ionization and thermal equilibrium with the UV background. We demonstrate that the high-pressure scenario requires multiple gas phases to explain the observations, and a large deposition of energy at {\textgreater}{\~{}}100 kpc to offset the energy radiated by the cooling gas. In contrast, the low-pressure scenario can explain all considered observations with a single gas phase in thermal equilibrium, provided that the baryon overdensity is comparable to the dark-matter overdensity, and that the gas is enriched to {\textgreater}{\~{}}Z{\_}sun/3 with an ISM-like dust-to-metal ratio. The low-pressure scenario implies that OVI traces a cool flow with mass flow rate of {\~{}}5 M{\_}sun yr{\^{}}-1, comparable to the star formation rate of the central galaxies. The OVI line widths are consistent with the velocity shear expected within this flow. The low-pressure scenario predicts a bimodality in absorption line ratios at {\~{}}100 kpc, due to the pressure jump across the accretion shock.},

abstract = {We use hydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations from the FIRE project to explore the morphologies and kinematics of fifteen Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. Our sample ranges from compact, bulge-dominated systems with 90{\%} of their stellar mass within 2.5 kpc to well-ordered disks that reach {\$}\backslashgtrsim15{\$} kpc. The gas in our galaxies always forms a thin, rotation-supported disk at {\$}z=0{\$}, with sizes primarily determined by the gas mass. For stars, we quantify kinematics and morphology both via the fraction of stars on disk-like orbits and with the radial extent of the stellar disk. In this mass range, stellar morphology and kinematics are poorly correlated with the properties of the halo available from dark matter-only simulations (halo merger history, spin, or formation time). They more strongly correlate with the gaseous histories of the galaxies: those that maintain a high gas mass in the disk after {\$}z\backslashsim1{\$} develop well-ordered stellar disks. The best predictor of morphology we identify is the spin of the gas in the halo at the time the galaxy formed 1/2 of its stars (i.e. the gas that builds the galaxy). High-{\$}z{\$} mergers, before a hot halo emerges, produce some of the most massive bulges in the sample (from compact disks in gas-rich mergers), while later-forming bulges typically originate from internal processes, as satellites are stripped of gas before the galaxies merge. Moreover, most stars in {\$}z=0{\$} MW-mass galaxies (even {\$}z=0{\$} bulge stars) form in a disk: {\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$}60-90{\%} of stars begin their lives rotationally supported.},

abstract = {The Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project explores the role of feedback in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Previous FIRE simulations used an identical source code (FIRE-1) for consistency. Now, motivated by the development of more accurate numerics (hydrodynamic solvers, gravitational softening, supernova coupling) and the exploration of new physics (e.g. magnetic fields), we introduce FIRE-2, an updated numerical implementation of FIRE physics for the GIZMO code. We run a suite of simulations and show FIRE-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties relative to FIRE-1. We then pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics in galaxy simulations. Details of the star-formation (SF) algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects, provided that we include metal-line cooling and SF occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present several new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are remarkably robust to the numerics that we test, provided that: (1) Toomre masses (cold disk scale heights) are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation and isotropy, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. As resolution increases, stellar masses and profiles converge first, followed by metal abundances and visual morphologies, then properties of winds and the circumgalactic medium. The central ({\~{}}kpc) mass concentration of massive (L*) galaxies is sensitive to numerics, particularly how winds ejected into hot halos are trapped, mixed, and recycled into the galaxy. Multiple feedback mechanisms are required to reproduce observations: SNe regulate stellar masses; OB/AGB mass loss fuels late-time SF; radiative feedback suppresses instantaneous SFRs and accretion onto dwarfs. We provide tables, initial conditions, and the numerical algorithms required to reproduce our simulations.},

The properties of our simulated groups, such as baryon fractions, SZ flux, and X-ray luminosities (L{\_}X), are broadly consistent with existing observations, even though feedback from active galactic nuclei is not included. We make predictions for future observations of lower-mass objects for both SZ and diffuse X-ray measurements, finding that they are not just scaled-down versions of massive galaxies, but more strongly affected by galactic winds driven by star formation. Low-mass haloes ({\textless}{\~{}}10{\^{}}11 Msun) retain a low fraction of their baryons, which results in a strong suppression of the SZ signal. Our simulations therefore predict a scaling with halo mass that is steeper than self-similar for haloes less massive than 10{\^{}}13 Msun. For halo masses {\textless}{\~{}}10{\^{}}12 Msun, L{\_}X is time-variable and correlated primarily with the star formation rate (SFR). For these objects, the diffuse X-ray emission is powered mostly by galactic winds and the gas dominating the X-ray emission is flowing out with radial velocities close to the halo's circular velocity. For halo masses {\textgreater}{\~{}}10{\^{}}13 Msun, on the other hand, L{\_}X is much less variable and not correlated with the SFR, because the emission originates from the quasi-hydrostatic, virialized halo gas.},

abstract = {We use a particle tracking analysis to study the origins of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), separating it into (1) accretion from the intergalactic medium (IGM), (2) wind from the central galaxy, and (3) gas ejected from other galaxies. Our sample consists of 21 FIRE-2 simulations, spanning the halo mass range Mh ∼ 1010–1012 M⊙, and we focus on z = 0.25 and z = 2. Owing to strong stellar feedback, only ∼L⋆ haloes retain a baryon mass {\$}\backslashgtrsim\backslash! 50\backslashhbox{\{} per cent{\}}{\$} of their cosmic budget. Metals are more efficiently retained by haloes, with a retention fraction {\$}\backslashgtrsim\backslash! 50\backslashhbox{\{} per cent{\}}{\$}. Across all masses and redshifts analysed {\$}\backslashgtrsim \backslash!60\backslashhbox{\{} per cent{\}}{\$} of the CGM mass originates as IGM accretion (some of which is associated with infalling haloes). Overall, the second most important contribution is wind from the central galaxy, though gas ejected or stripped from satellites can contribute a comparable mass in ∼L⋆ haloes. Gas can persist in the CGM for billions of years, resulting in well mixed-halo gas. Sightlines through the CGM are therefore likely to intersect gas of multiple origins. For low-redshift ∼L⋆ haloes, cool gas (T {\textless} 104.7 K) is distributed on average preferentially along the galaxy plane, however with strong halo-to-halo variability. The metallicity of IGM accretion is systematically lower than the metallicity of winds (typically by ≳1 dex), although CGM and IGM metallicities depend significantly on the treatment of subgrid metal diffusion. Our results highlight the multiple physical mechanisms that contribute to the CGM and will inform observational efforts to develop a cohesive picture.},

@article{Hafen2019a,
abstract = {We analyze the different fates of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in FIRE-2 cosmological simulations, focusing on the redshifts z = 0.25 and z = 2 representative of recent surveys. Our analysis includes 21 zoom-in simulations covering the halo mass range Mh(z = 0) ∼ 1010 − 1012M⊙. We analyze both where the gas ends up after first leaving the CGM (its “proximate” fate), as well as its location at z = 0 (its “ultimate” fate). Of the CGM at z = 2, about half is found in the ISM or stars of the central galaxy by z = 0 in Mh(z = 2) ∼ 5 × 1011 M⊙ halos, but most of the CGM in lower-mass halos ends up in the IGM. This is so even though most of the CGM in Mh(z = 2) ∼ 5 × 1010 M⊙ halos first accretes onto the central galaxy before being ejected into the IGM. On the other hand, most of the CGM mass at z = 0.25 remains in the CGM by z = 0 at all halo masses analyzed. Of the CGM gas that subsequently accretes onto the central galaxy in the progenitors of Mh(z = 0) ∼ 1012 M⊙ halos, most of it is cool (T ∼ 104 K) at z = 2 but hot (∼Tvir) at z ∼ 0.25, consistent with the expected transition from cold mode to hot mode accretion. Despite the transition in accretion mode, at both z = 0.25 and z = 2 {\$}\backslashgtrsim 80\backslash{\%}{\$} of the cool gas in Mh ≳ 1011M⊙ halos will accrete onto a galaxy. We find that the metallicity of CGM gas is typically a poor predictor of both its proximate and ultimate fates. This is because there is in general little correlation between the origin of CGM gas and its fate owing to substantial mixing while in the CGM.},
