 abstract = {We present a comparative study of galaxies and intergalactic gas toward the z = 2.73 quasar HS 1700+6416, to explore the effects of galaxy formation feedback on the IGM. Our observations and ionization simulations indicate that the volume within 100-200 h physical kpc of high-redshift galaxies is populated by very small (ΔL ≲ 1 kpc), dense (ρ/ ~ 1000), and metal-rich (Z ≳ - Z☉) absorption-line regions. These systems often contain shock-heated gas seen in O VI and may exhibit [Si/C] abundance enhancements suggestive of preferential enrichment by Type II supernovae. We argue that the absorber geometries resemble thin sheets or bubbles and that their unusual physical properties can be explained using a simple model of radiatively efficient shocks plowing through moderately overdense intergalactic filaments. The high metallicities suggest that these shocks are being expelled from, rather than falling into, star-forming galaxies. There is a drop-off in the intergalactic gas density at galaxy impact parameters of ≳300 physical kpc (≳1 comoving Mpc) that may represent boundaries of the gas structures where galaxies reside. The heavy-element enhancement near galaxies covers smaller distances: at galactocentric radii between 100 and 200 h kpc the observed abundances blend into the general metallicity field of the IGM. Our results suggest that either supernova-driven winds or dynamical stripping of interstellar gas alters the IGM near massive galaxies, even at R ≳ 100 kpc. However, only a few percent of the total mass in the Lyα forest is encompassed by this active feedback at z ~ 2.5. The effects could be more widespread if the more numerous metal-poor C IV systems at impact parameters ≳200 h kpc are the tepid remnants of very powerful late-time winds. However, based on present observations it is not clear that this scenario is to be favored over one involving preenrichment by smaller galaxies at z ≳ 6.},

 abstract = {Probing a galaxy halo with a radio burst Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond flashes of radio emission from distant galaxies. It has only recently become possible to locate single bursts precisely enough to determine the host galaxy. Prochaska et al. have observed and localized a FRB using a radio interferometer. The line of sight to the host galaxy coincidentally passes through the outskirts of a closer foreground galaxy. By analyzing the propagation of the FRB, the authors put constraints on the density and magnetization of gas in the outskirts of the foreground galaxy. The technique provides complementary information to existing methods using background quasars. Science, this issue p. 231 A fast radio burst passing through the outskirts of a foreground galaxy constrains the gas density and magnetization. Present-day galaxies are surrounded by cool and enriched halo gas extending for hundreds of kiloparsecs. This halo gas is thought to be the dominant reservoir of material available to fuel future star formation, but direct constraints on its mass and physical properties have been difficult to obtain. We report the detection of a fast radio burst (FRB 181112), localized with arcsecond precision, that passes through the halo of a foreground galaxy. Analysis of the burst shows that the halo gas has low net magnetization and turbulence. Our results imply predominantly diffuse gas in massive galactic halos, even those hosting active supermassive black holes, contrary to some previous results.},

 abstract = {We report the serendipitous detection of an H2-bearing damped Lyα absorber at z = 0.576 in the spectrum of the QSO J0111–0316 in the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey. Spectroscopic observations from Hubble Space Telescope-COS in the far-ultraviolet reveal a damped absorber with log[N(H i)/cm−2] = 20.1 ± 0.2 and log[N(H2)/cm−2] . The diffuse molecular gas is found in two velocity components separated by Δ ν ≈ 60 km s−1, with >99.9% of the total H2 column density concentrated in one component. At a metallicity of ≈50% of solar, there is evidence for Fe enhancement and dust depletion, with a dust-to-gas ratio κ O ≈ 0.4. A galaxy redshift survey conducted with IMACS and LDSS-3C on Magellan reveals an overdensity of nine galaxies at projected distance d ≤ 600 proper kpc (pkpc) and line-of-sight velocity offset Δ ν g ≤ 300 km s−1 from the absorber. The closest is a massive, early-type galaxy at d = 41 pkpc that contains ≈70% of the total stellar mass identified at d ≤ 310 pkpc of the H2 absorber. The close proximity of the H2-bearing gas to the quiescent galaxy and the Fe-enhanced chemical abundance pattern of the absorber suggest a physical connection, in contrast to a picture in which DLAs are primarily associated with gas-rich dwarfs. This case study illustrates that deep galaxy redshift surveys are needed to gain insight into the diverse environments that host dense and potentially star-forming gas.},

 abstract = {We address the origin of the robust bimodality observed in galaxy properties about a characteristic stellar mass ∼3 x 10 10 M ⊙ . Less massive galaxies tend to be ungrouped blue star forming discs, while more massive galaxies are typically grouped red old-star spheroids. Colour-magnitude data show a gap between the red and blue sequences, extremely red luminous galaxies already at z ∼ 1, a truncation of today's blue sequence above L*, and massive starbursts at z ∼ 2-4. We propose that these features are driven by the thermal properties of the inflowing gas and their interplay with the clustering and feedback processes, all functions of the dark matter halo mass and associated with a similar characteristic scale. In haloes below a critical shock-heating mass M shock ≤ 10 12 M ⊙ , discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial shock, yielding efficient early star formation. It is regulated by supernova feedback into a long sequence of bursts in blue galaxies constrained to a 'fundamental line'. Cold streams penetrating through hot media in M ≥ M shock haloes preferentially at z ≥ 2 lead to massive starbursts in L > L* galaxies. At z M shock haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock, and being dilute it becomes vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such as active galactic nuclei. This shuts off gas supply and prevents further star formation, leading by passive evolution to 'red-and-dead' massive spheroids starting at z ∼ 1. A minimum in feedback efficiency near M shock explains the observed minimum in M/L and the qualitative features of the star formation history. The cold flows provide a hint for solving the angular momentum problem. When these processes are incorporated in simulations they recover the main bimodality features and solve other open puzzles.},

 abstract = {We investigate how the way galaxies acquire their gas across cosmic time in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations is modified by a comprehensive physical model for baryonic feedback processes. To do so, we compare two simulations - with and without feedback - both evolved with the moving mesh code AREPO. The feedback runs implement the full physics model of the Illustris simulation project, including 
star formation driven galactic winds and energetic feedback from supermassive black-holes. We explore: (a) the accretion rate of material contributing to the net growth of 
galaxies and originating directly from the intergalactic medium, finding that feedback strongly suppresses the raw, as well as the net, in inflow of this "smooth mode" gas at 
all redshifts, regardless of the temperature history of newly acquired gas. (b) At the virial radius the temperature and radial flux of inflowing gas is largely unaffected at z =2. However, the spherical covering fraction of inflowing gas at 0.25 r_(vir) decreases substantially, from more than 80% to less than 50%, while the rates of both inflow and outflow increase, indicative of recycling across this boundary. (c) The fractional contribution of smooth accretion to the total accretion rate is lower in the simulation with feedback, by roughly a factor of two across all redshifts. Moreover, the smooth component of gas with a cold temperature history, is entirely suppressed in the feed-back run at z<1. (d) The amount of time taken by gas to cross from the virial radius to the galaxy - the "halo transit time" - increases in the presence of feedback by a factor of ≃ 2-3, and is notably independent of halo mass. We discuss the possible implications of this invariance for theoretical models of hot halo gas cooling.},

These dwarfs were discovered as part of our Subaru+Hyper Suprime-Cam MADCASH survey: MADCASH-1 is a satellite of NGC 2403 (D ∼ 3.2 Mpc), and MADCASH-2 is a previously unknown dwarf galaxy near NGC 4214 (D ∼ 3 Mpc). Our HST data reach >3.5 mag below the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) of each dwarf, allowing us to derive their structural parameters and assess their stellar populations. We measure TRGB distances ( DMADCASH−1=3.41−0.23+0.24 Mpc, DMADCASH−2=3.00−0.15+0.13 Mpc), and confirm the dwarfs’ associations with their host galaxies. MADCASH-1 is a predominantly old, metal-poor stellar system (age ∼13.5 Gyr, [M/H] ∼ −2.0), similar to many Local Group dwarfs. Modelling of MADCASH-2's color–magnitude diagram suggests that it contains mostly ancient, metal-poor stars (age ∼13.5 Gyr, [M/H] ∼ −2.0), but that ∼10% of its stellar mass was formed 1.1–1.5 Gyr ago and ∼1% was formed 400–500 Myr ago. Given its recent star formation, we search MADCASH-2 for neutral hydrogen using the Green Bank Telescope, but find no emission and estimate an upper limit on the H i mass of <4.8 × 104 M ⊙. These are the faintest dwarf satellites known around host galaxies of LMC mass outside the Local Group (M V,MADCASH−1 = −7.81 ± 0.18, M V,MADCASH−2 = −9.15 ± 0.12), and one of them shows signs of recent environmental quenching by its host. Once the MADCASH survey for faint dwarf satellites is complete, our census will enable us to test predictions from cold dark matter models for hierarchical structure formation and discover the physical mechanisms by which low-mass hosts influence the evolution of their satellites.},

 abstract = {Cool Accretion Numerical models predict that in order to keep forming stars, galaxies should be continuously replenished with gas from the intergalactic medium. Using data from the Very Large Telescope in Chile, Bouché et al. (p. 50) report observations that are consistent with accretion of cold, chemically pristine gas onto a star-forming galaxy at a time when the cosmic star-formation activity was at its peak. Observations of gas near a star-forming galaxy reveal kinematic signatures expected from gas inflowing onto the galaxy. Galaxies are thought to be fed by the continuous accretion of intergalactic gas, but direct observational evidence has been elusive. The accreted gas is expected to orbit about the galaxy’s halo, delivering not just fuel for star formation but also angular momentum to the galaxy, leading to distinct kinematic signatures. We report observations showing these distinct signatures near a typical distant star-forming galaxy, where the gas is detected using a background quasar passing 26 kiloparsecs from the host. Our observations indicate that gas accretion plays a major role in galaxy growth because the estimated accretion rate is comparable to the star-formation rate.},

 The microphysics of ∼ GeV cosmic ray (CR) transport on galactic scales remain deeply uncertain, with almost all studies adopting simple prescriptions (e.g. constant diffusivity). We explore different physically motivated, anisotropic, dynamical CR transport scalings in high-resolution cosmological Feedback In Realistic Environment (FIRE) simulations of dwarf and ∼L* galaxies where scattering rates vary with local plasma properties motivated by extrinsic turbulence (ET) or self-confinement (SC) scenarios, with varying assumptions about e.g. turbulent power spectra on un-resolved scales, Alfvén-wave damping, etc. We self-consistently predict observables including γ-rays (Lγ), grammage, residence times, and CR energy densities to constrain the models. We demonstrate many non-linear dynamical effects (not captured in simpler models) tend to enhance confinement. For example, in multiphase media, even allowing arbitrary fast transport in neutral gas does not substantially reduce CR residence times (or Lγ), as transport is rate-limited by the ionized WIM and ‘inner CGM’ gaseous halo (104–106 K gas within $\lesssim 10\!-\!30\,$ kpc), and Lγ can be dominated by trapping in small ‘patches’. Most physical ET models contribute negligible scattering of ∼1–10 GeV CRs, but it is crucial to account for anisotropy and damping (especially of fast modes) or else scattering rates would violate observations. We show that the most widely assumed scalings for SC models produce excessive confinement by factors ≳100 in the warm ionized medium (WIM) and inner CGM, where turbulent and Landau damping dominate. This suggests either a breakdown of quasi-linear theory used to derive the CR transport parameters in SC, or that other novel damping mechanisms dominate in intermediate-density ionized gas.},

The galaxies, drawn from redshift surveys of the GOODS fields and the Extended Groth Strip, sample the range in star formation rates (SFRs) occupied by the star-forming sequence with stellar masses log M*/M☉ ≳ 9.6 down to SFR ≳ 2 M☉ yr−1 at 0.3 < z < 0.7. Using the Doppler shifts of Mg ii and Fe ii absorption as tracers of cool gas kinematics, we detect large-scale winds in 66 ± 5% of the galaxies. Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging and our spectral analysis indicate that the outflow detection rate depends primarily on galaxy orientation: winds are detected in ∼89% of galaxies having inclinations (i) <30° (face-on), while the wind detection rate is ∼45% in objects having i > 50° (edge-on). Combined with the comparatively weak dependence of wind detection rate on intrinsic galaxy properties, this implies that biconical outflows are ubiquitous in normal, star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 0.5. We find that wind velocity is correlated with galaxy M* at 3.4σ significance, while outflow equivalent width is correlated with SFR at 3.5σ significance, suggesting hosts with higher SFR launch more material and/or generate a larger velocity spread for the absorbing clouds. Assuming the gas is driven into halos with isothermal density profiles, the wind velocities (∼200–400 km s−1) permit escape from the halo potentials only for the lowest-M* systems in the sample. However, the gas carries sufficient energy to reach distances ≳ 50 kpc, and may therefore be a viable source of material for the massive, cool circumgalactic medium around bright galaxies at z ∼ 0.},

 Observations of emission lines in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) often find fast (∼1000 km s−1) outflows extending to kiloparsec scales, seen in ionized, neutral atomic and molecular gas. In this work we present radiative transfer calculations of emission lines in hydrodynamic simulations of AGN outflows driven by a hot wind bubble, including non-equilibrium chemistry, to explore how these lines trace the physical properties of the multiphase outflow. We find that the hot bubble compresses the line-emitting gas, resulting in higher pressures than in the ambient interstellar medium or that would be produced by the AGN radiation pressure. This implies that observed emission line ratios such as [O iv]$_{25 \, \rm {\mu m}}$ / [Ne ii]$_{12 \, \rm {\mu m}}$, [Ne v]$_{14 \, \rm {\mu m}}$ / [Ne ii]$_{12 \, \rm {\mu m}}$, and [N iii]$_{57 \, \rm {\mu m}}$ / [N ii]$_{122 \, \rm {\mu m}}$ constrain the presence of the bubble and hence the outflow driving mechanism. However, the line-emitting gas is under-pressurized compared to the hot bubble itself, and much of the line emission arises from gas that is out of pressure, thermal and/or chemical equilibrium. Our results thus suggest that assuming equilibrium conditions, as commonly done in AGN line emission models, is not justified if a hot wind bubble is present. We also find that ≳50 per cent of the mass outflow rate, momentum flux, and kinetic energy flux of the outflow are traced by lines such as [N ii]$_{122 \, \rm {\mu m}}$ and [Ne iii]$_{15 \, \rm {\mu m}}$ (produced in the 10$^{4} \, \rm {K}$ phase) and [C ii]$_{158 \, \rm {\mu m}}$ (produced in the transition from 10$^{4} \, \rm {K}$ to 100 K).},

Starting at z=4 from identical initial conditions, implementations of weak and strong stellar feedback produce bulge- and disc-dominated galaxies, respectively. Strong feedback favours disc formation: (1) because conversion of gas into stars is suppressed at early times, as required by abundance matching arguments, resulting in flat star formation histories and higher gas fractions; (2) because 50% of the stars form in situ from recycled disc gas with angular momentum only weakly related to that of the z=0 dark halo; (3) because late-time gas accretion is typically an order of magnitude stronger and has higher specific angular momentum, with recycled gas dominating over primordial infall; (4) because 25-30% of the total accreted gas is ejected entirely before z~1, removing primarily low angular momentum material which enriches the nearby inter-galactic medium. Most recycled gas roughly conserves its angular momentum, but material ejected for long times and to large radii can gain significant angular momentum before re-accretion. These processes lower galaxy formation efficiency in addition to promoting disc formation.},

 abstract = {We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations from the FIRE (Feedback in Realistic Environments) project to make predictions for the covering fractions of neutral hydrogen around galaxies at z = 2–4. These simulations resolve the interstellar medium of galaxies and explicitly implement a comprehensive set of stellar feedback mechanisms. Our simulation sample consists of 16 main haloes covering the mass range M_h ≈ 10^9–6 × 10^(12) M_⊙ at z = 2, including 12 haloes in the mass range M_h ∼ 10^(11)–10^(12) M_⊙ corresponding to Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). We process our simulations with a ray tracing method to compute the ionization state of the gas. Galactic winds increase the H i covering fractions in galaxy haloes by direct ejection of cool gas from galaxies and through interactions with gas inflowing from the intergalactic medium. Our simulations predict H i covering fractions for Lyman limit systems (LLSs) consistent with measurements around z ∼ 2–2.5 LBGs; these covering fractions are a factor ∼2 higher than our previous calculations without galactic winds. The fractions of H i absorbers arising in inflows and in outflows are on average ∼50 per cent but exhibit significant time variability, ranging from ∼10 to ∼90 per cent. For our most massive haloes, we find a factor ∼3 deficit in the LLS covering fraction relative to what is measured around quasars at z ∼ 2, suggesting that the presence of a quasar may affect the properties of halo gas on ∼100 kpc scales. The predicted covering fractions, which decrease with time, peak at M_h ∼ 10^(11)–10^(12) M_⊙, near the peak of the star formation efficiency in dark matter haloes. In our simulations, star formation and galactic outflows are highly time dependent; H i covering fractions are also time variable but less so because they represent averages over large areas.},

 We present initial results from the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS). CUBS is designed to map diffuse baryonic structures at redshift z ≲ 1 using absorption-line spectroscopy of 15 UV-bright QSOs with matching deep galaxy survey data. CUBS QSOs are selected based on their NUV brightness to avoid biases against the presence of intervening Lyman limit systems (LLSs) at zabs < 1. We report five new LLSs of $\log \, N({\mathrm{ H} \,{\small I}})/{{\rm cm^{-2}}}\gtrsim 17.2$ over a total redshift survey path-length of $\Delta \, z_{\mathrm{ LL}}=9.3$, and a number density of $n(z)=0.43_{-0.18}^{+0.26}$. Considering all absorbers with $\log \, N({{\mathrm{ H} \,{\small I}}})/{{\rm cm^{-2}}}\gt 16.5$ leads to $n(z)=1.08_{-0.25}^{+0.31}$ at zabs < 1. All LLSs exhibit a multicomponent structure and associated metal transitions from multiple ionization states such as C ii, C iii, Mg ii, Si ii, Si iii, and O vi absorption. Differential chemical enrichment levels as well as ionization states are directly observed across individual components in three LLSs. We present deep galaxy survey data obtained using the VLT-MUSE integral field spectrograph and the Magellan Telescopes, reaching sensitivities necessary for detecting galaxies fainter than $0.1\, L_*$ at d ≲ 300 physical kpc (pkpc) in all five fields. A diverse range of galaxy properties is seen around these LLSs, from a low-mass dwarf galaxy pair, a co-rotating gaseous halo/disc, a star-forming galaxy, a massive quiescent galaxy, to a galaxy group. The closest galaxies have projected distances ranging from d = 15 to 72 pkpc and intrinsic luminosities from ${\approx} 0.01\, L_*$ to ${\approx} 3\, L_*$. Our study shows that LLSs originate in a variety of galaxy environments and trace gaseous structures with a broad range of metallicities.},

 abstract = {We examine the effects of stellar feedback and bursty star formation on low-mass galaxies (Mstar = 2 × 106 − 5 × 1010 M⊙) using the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. While previous studies emphasized the impact of feedback on dark matter profiles, we investigate the impact on the stellar component: kinematics, radial migration, size evolution, and population gradients. Feedback-driven outflows/inflows drive significant radial stellar migration over both short and long timescales via two processes: (1) outflowing/infalling gas can remain star-forming, producing young stars that migrate ∼1 kpc within their first 100 Myr, and (2) gas outflows/inflows drive strong fluctuations in the global potential, transferring energy to all stars. These processes produce several dramatic effects. First, galaxies’ effective radii can fluctuate by factors of >2 over ∼200 Myr, and these rapid size fluctuations can account for much of the observed scatter in the radius at fixed Mstar. Second, the cumulative effects of many outflow/infall episodes steadily heat stellar orbits, causing old stars to migrate outward most strongly. This age-dependent radial migration mixes—and even inverts—intrinsic age and metallicity gradients. Thus, the galactic-archaeology approach of calculating radial star formation histories from stellar populations at z = 0 can be severely biased. These effects are strongest at Mstar ≈ 107–9.6 M⊙, the same regime where feedback most efficiently cores galaxies. Thus, detailed measurements of stellar kinematics in low-mass galaxies can strongly constrain feedback models and test baryonic solutions to small-scale problems in ΛCDM.},

 abstract = {We use the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations to study the formation of a quasi-static, virial-temperature gas phase in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) at redshifts 0 < z < 5 and how the formation of this virialized phase affects the evolution of galactic disks. We demonstrate that when the halo mass crosses ∼1012 M ⊙, the cooling time of shocked gas in the inner CGM (∼0.1R vir, where R vir is the virial radius) exceeds the local free-fall time. The inner CGM then experiences a transition from on average subvirial temperatures (T ≪ T vir), large pressure fluctuations, and supersonic inflow/outflow velocities to virial temperatures (T ∼ T vir), uniform pressures, and subsonic velocities. This transition occurs when the outer CGM (∼0.5R vir) is already subsonic and has a temperature ∼T vir, indicating that the longer cooling times at large radii allow the outer CGM to virialize at lower halo masses than the inner CGM. This outside-in CGM virialization scenario is in contrast with inside-out scenarios commonly envisioned based on more idealized simulations. We demonstrate that inner CGM virialization coincides with abrupt changes in the central galaxy and its stellar feedback: the galaxy settles into a stable rotating disk, star formation transitions from “bursty” to “steady,” and stellar-driven galaxy-scale outflows are suppressed. Our results thus suggest that CGM virialization is initially associated with the formation of rotation-dominated thin galactic disks, rather than with the quenching of star formation as often assumed.},

The NH i selection avoids metallicity biases inherent in many previous studies of the low-redshift CGM. We compare the column densities of weakly ionized metal species (e.g., O ii, Si ii, Mg ii) to NH i in the strongest H i component of each absorber. We find that the metallicity distribution of the LLS (and hence the cool CGM) is bimodal with metal-poor and metal-rich branches peaking at [X/H] ≃ −1.6 and −0.3 (or about 2.5% and 50% solar metallicities). The cool CGM probed by these LLS is predominantly ionized. The metal-rich branch of the population likely traces winds, recycled outflows, and tidally stripped gas; the metal-poor branch has properties consistent with cold accretion streams thought to be a major source of fresh gas for star forming galaxies. Both branches have a nearly equal number of absorbers. Our results thus demonstrate there is a significant mass of previously undiscovered cold metal-poor gas and confirm the presence of metal enriched gas in the CGM of z ≲ 1 galaxies.},

These galaxies span a range of stellar masses (9.45 ⩽ log10[M*/M☉] ⩽ 10.7) and star formation rates (0.14 ⩽ log10[SFR/M☉ yr−1] ⩽ 2.35). We identify the cool outflowing component in the Mg ii absorption and find that the equivalent width of the outflowing component increases with stellar mass. The outflow equivalent width also increases steadily with the increasing star formation rate of the galaxies. At similar stellar masses, the blue galaxies exhibit a significantly higher outflow equivalent width as compared to red galaxies. The outflow equivalent width shows strong correlation with the star formation surface density (ΣSFR) of the sample. For the disk galaxies, the outflow equivalent width is higher for the face-on systems as compared to the edge-on ones, indicating that for the disk galaxies, the outflowing gas is primarily bipolar in geometry. Galaxies typically exhibit outflow velocities ranging from −150 km s−1 ∼−200 km s−1 and, on average, the face-on galaxies exhibit higher outflow velocity as compared to the edge-on ones. Galaxies with irregular morphologies exhibit outflow equivalent width as well as outflow velocities comparable to face on disk galaxies. These galaxies exhibit mass outflow rates >5–7 M☉ yr−1 and a mass loading factor () comparable to the star formation rates of the galaxies.},

We use ultraviolet absorption measurements of Si ii, Si iii, Si iv, C ii, and C iv from the Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and O vi from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer to provide an unparalleled look at how the physical conditions and metals are distributed in the CGM of M31. We find that Si iii and O vi have a covering factor near unity for R ≲ 1.2 and ≲1.9 , respectively, demonstrating that M31 has a very extended ∼104–105.5 K ionized CGM. The metal and baryon masses of the 104–105.5 K CGM gas within are ≳108 and ≳4 × 1010 (Z/0.3 Z⊙)−1 M⊙, respectively. There is not much azimuthal variation in the column densities or kinematics, but there is with R. The CGM gas at R ≲ 0.5 is more dynamic and has more complicated, multiphase structures than at larger radii, perhaps a result of more direct impact of galactic feedback in the inner regions of the CGM. Several absorbers are projected spatially and kinematically close to M31 dwarf satellites, but we show that those are unlikely to give rise to the observed absorption. Cosmological zoom simulations of ∼L* galaxies have O vi extending well beyond as observed for M31 but do not reproduce well the radial column density profiles of the lower ions. However, some similar trends are also observed, such as the lower ions showing a larger dispersion in column density and stronger dependence on R than higher ions. Based on our findings, it is likely that the Milky Way has a ∼104–105.5 K CGM as extended as for M31 and their CGM (especially the warm–hot gas probed by O vi) are overlapping.},

 abstract = {Galaxies moving through the intracluster medium (ICM) of a cluster of galaxies can lose gas via ram pressure stripping. This stripped gas forms a tail behind the galaxy which is potentially observable. In this paper, we carry out hydrodynamical simulations of a galaxy undergoing stripping with a focus on the gas properties in the wake and their observational signatures. We include radiative cooling in an adaptive hydrocode in order to investigate the impact of a clumpy, multi-phase interstellar medium. We find that including cooling results in a very different morphology for the gas in the tail, with a much wider range of temperatures and densities. The tail is significantly narrower in runs with radiative cooling, in agreement with observed wakes. In addition, we make detailed predictions of H i, Hα, and X-ray emission for the wake, showing that we generally expect detectable H i and Hα signatures, but no observable X-ray emission (at least for our chosen ram pressure strength and ICM conditions). We find that the relative strength of the Hα diagnostic depends somewhat on our adopted minimum temperature floor (below which we set cooling to zero to mimic physics processes not included in the simulation).},

We detect O vii and O viii absorption lines at z = 0 in extragalactic sight lines and measure accurate column densities using both Kα and Kβ lines of O vii. We then combine these measurements with the emission measure of the Galactic halo from literature to derive the density and the path length of the CGM. We show that the warm-hot phase of the CGM is massive, extending over a large region around the Milky Way, with a radius of over 100 kpc. The mass content of this phase is over 10 billion solar masses, many times more than that in cooler gas phases and comparable to the total baryonic mass in the disk of the Galaxy. The missing mass of the Galaxy appears to be in this warm-hot gas phase.},

We then extend the MHF code in order to track the orbital evolution of gravitationally bound objects through any given cosmological N-body simulation -our so-called 'MLAPM halo tracker' (MHT). The mode of operation of MHT is demonstrated using a series of eight high-resolution N-body simulations of galaxy clusters. Each of these haloes hosts more than one million particles within their virial radii r vir . We use MHT as well as MHF to follow the temporal evolution of hundreds of individual satellites, and show that the radial distribution of these substructure satellites follows a 'universal' radial distribution irrespective of the environment and formation history of the host halo. This in fact might pose another problem for simulations of cold dark matter structure formation, as there are recent findings by Taylor, Silk & Babul that the Milky Way satellites are found preferentially closer to the Galactic Centre and simulations underestimate the amount of central substructure. Further, this universal substructure profile is anti-biased with respect to the underlying dark matter profile. The halo finder MHF will become part of the open source MLAPM distribution.},

 abstract = {Recent numerical and analytical studies have shown that galaxies accrete most of their baryons via the cold mode, from streams with temperatures T ∼ 104–105 K. At these temperatures, the streams should radiate primarily in the Lyα line and have therefore been proposed as a model to power the extended, high-redshift objects known as Lyα blobs, and may also be relevant for powering a range of less luminous Lyα sources. We introduce a new Lyα radiative transfer code, αRT, and calculate the transport of the Lyα emission from cold accretion in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we describe our methodology, and address physical and numerical issues that are critical to making accurate predictions for the cooling luminosity, but that have been mostly neglected or treated simplistically so far. In particular, we highlight the importance of self-shielding and of properly treating sub-resolution models in numerical simulations. Most existing simulations do not self-consistently incorporate these effects, which can lead to order-of-magnitude errors in the predicted cooling luminosity. Using a combination of post-processing ionizing radiative transfer and re-simulation techniques, we develop an approximation to the consistent evolution of the self-shielded gas. We quantify the dependence of the Lyα cooling luminosity on halo mass at z = 3 for the simplified problem of pure gas accretion embedded in the cosmic radiation background and without feedback, and present radiative transfer results for a particular system. While pure cooling in massive halos (without additional energy input from star formation and active galactic nuclei) is in principle sufficient to produce Lα ∼ 1043–1044 erg s−1 blobs, this requires including energy released in gas of density sufficient to form stars, but which is kept 100% gaseous in our optimistic estimates. Excluding emission from such dense gas yields lower luminosities by up to one to two orders of magnitude at high masses, making it difficult to explain the observed Lyα blobs with pure cooling. Resonant scattering produces diffuse Lyα halos, even for centrally concentrated emission, and broad double peaked line profiles. In particular, the emergent line widths are in general not representative of the velocity dispersion within galactic halos and cannot be directly used to infer host halo masses.},

 abstract = {Among the most important goals in cosmology is detecting and quantifying small (M_(halo)≃10^(6−9) M⊙) dark matter (DM) subhaloes. Current probes around the Milky Way (MW) are most sensitive to such substructure within ∼20 kpc of the halo centre, where the galaxy contributes significantly to the potential. We explore the effects of baryons on subhalo populations in ΛCDM using cosmological zoom-in baryonic simulations of MW-mass haloes from the Latte simulation suite, part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. Specifically, we compare simulations of the same two haloes run using (1) DM-only (DMO), (2) full baryonic physics and (3) DM with an embedded disc potential grown to match the FIRE simulation. Relative to baryonic simulations, DMO simulations contain ∼2 × as many subhaloes within 100 kpc of the halo centre; this excess is ≳5 × within 25 kpc. At z = 0, the baryonic simulations are completely devoid of subhaloes down to 3×10^6M⊙ within 15 kpc of the MW-mass galaxy, and fewer than 20 surviving subhaloes have orbital pericentres <20 kpc. Despite the complexities of baryonic physics, the simple addition of an embedded central disc potential to DMO simulations reproduces this subhalo depletion, including trends with radius, remarkably well. Thus, the additional tidal field from the central galaxy is the primary cause of subhalo depletion. Subhaloes on radial orbits that pass close to the central galaxy are preferentially destroyed, causing the surviving population to have tangentially biased orbits compared to DMO predictions. Our method of embedding a potential in DMO simulations provides a fast and accurate alternative to full baryonic simulations, thus enabling suites of cosmological simulations that can provide accurate and statistical predictions of substructure populations.},

 abstract = {We use cosmological simulations from the Feedback In Realistic Environments project, which implement a comprehensive set of stellar feedback processes, to study ultraviolet (UV) metal-line emission from the circum-galactic medium of high-redshift (z = 2–4) galaxies. Our simulations cover the halo mass range M_h ∼ 2 × 10^(11)–8.5 × 10^(12) M_⊙ at z = 2, representative of Lyman break galaxies. Of the transitions we analyse, the low-ionization C iii (977 A) and Si iii (1207 A) emission lines are the most luminous, with C iv (1548 A) and Si iv (1394 A) also showing interesting spatially extended structures. The more massive haloes are on average more UV-luminous. The UV metal-line emission from galactic haloes in our simulations arises primarily from collisionally ionized gas and is strongly time variable, with peak-to-trough variations of up to ∼2 dex. The peaks of UV metal-line luminosity correspond closely to massive and energetic mass outflow events, which follow bursts of star formation and inject sufficient energy into galactic haloes to power the metal-line emission. The strong time variability implies that even some relatively low-mass haloes may be detectable. Conversely, flux-limited samples will be biased towards haloes whose central galaxy has recently experienced a strong burst of star formation. Spatially extended UV metal-line emission around high-redshift galaxies should be detectable by current and upcoming integral field spectrographs such as the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer on the Very Large Telescope and Keck Cosmic Web Imager.},

 abstract = {Deep observations have detected extended Lyα emission nebulae surrounding tens of quasars at redshift 2–6. However, the metallicity of such extended halos is still poorly understood. We perform a detailed analysis on a large sample of 80 quasars at z ∼ 3 based on MUSE-VLT data. We find clear evidence of extended emission of the UV nebular lines such as C iv λ1549 or He ii λ1640 for about 20% of the sample, while C iii] λ1909 is only marginally detected in a few objects. By stacking the cubes, we detect emission of C iv, He ii, and C iii] out to a radius of about 45 kpc. C iv and He ii show a radial decline much steeper than Lyα, while C iii] shows a shallower profile similar to Lyα in the inner 45 kpc. We infer that the average metallicity of the circumgalactic gas within the central 30–50 kpc is ∼0.5 solar, or even higher. However, we also find evidence of a component of the Lyα halos, which has much weaker metal emission lines relative to Lyα. We suggest that the high metallicity of the circumgalactic medium within the central 30–50 kpc is associated with chemical pre-enrichment by past quasar-driven outflows and that there is a more extended component of the circumgalactic medium that has much lower metallicity and is likely associated with near-pristine gas accreted from the intergalactic medium. We show that our observational results are in good agreement with the expectations of the FABLE zoom-in cosmological simulations.},

 abstract = {We analyzed the spatial distribution of 28,500 photometrically selected galaxies with magnitude 23.5 < ℛAB < 25.5 and redshift 1.4 < z < 3.5 in 21 fields with a total area of 0.81 deg2. The galaxies were divided into three subsamples, with mean redshifts = 1.7, 2.2, and 2.9, according to their UnGℛ colors. Combining the galaxies' measured angular clustering with redshift distributions inferred from 1600 spectroscopic redshifts, we find comoving correlation lengths at the three redshifts of r0 = 4.5 ± 0.6, 4.2 ± 0.5, and 4.0 ± 0.6 h-1 Mpc, respectively, and infer a roughly constant correlation function slope of γ = 1.6 ± 0.1. We derive similar numbers from the 1600 object spectroscopic sample itself with a new statistic, K, that is insensitive to many possible systematics. Galaxies that are bright in ℛ (λrest ~ 1500-2500 Å) cluster more strongly than fainter galaxies at z = 2.9 and 2.2 but not, apparently, at z = 1.7. Comparison to a numerical simulation that is consistent with recent WMAP observations suggests that galaxies in our samples are associated with dark matter halos of mass 1011.2-1011.8 (z = 2.9), 1011.8-1012.2 (z = 2.2), and 1011.9-1012.3 M☉ (z = 1.7) and that a small fraction of the halos contain more than one galaxy that satisfies our selection criteria. Adding recent observations of galaxy clustering at z ~ 0 and ~1 to the simulation results, we conclude that the typical object in our samples will evolve into an elliptical galaxy by redshift z = 0 and will already have an early-type spectrum by redshift z = 1. We comment briefly on the implied relationship between galaxies in our survey and those selected with other techniques.},

 We study the effects of cosmic rays (CRs) on outflows from star-forming galaxies in the circum and inter-galactic medium (CGM/IGM), in high-resolution, fully-cosmological FIRE-2 simulations (accounting for mechanical and radiative stellar feedback, magnetic fields, anisotropic conduction/viscosity/CR diffusion and streaming, and CR losses). We showed previously that massive (Mhalo ≳ 1011 M⊙), low-redshift (z ≲ 1 − 2) halos can have CR pressure dominate over thermal CGM pressure and balance gravity, giving rise to a cooler CGM with an equilibrium density profile. This dramatically alters outflows. Absent CRs, high gas thermal pressure in massive halos “traps” galactic outflows near the disk, so they recycle. With CRs injected in supernovae as modeled here, the low-pressure halo allows “escape” and CR pressure gradients continuously accelerate this material well into the IGM in “fast” outflows, while lower-density gas at large radii is accelerated in-situ into “slow” outflows that extend to >Mpc scales. CGM/IGM outflow morphologies are radically altered: they become mostly volume-filling (with inflow in a thin mid-plane layer) and coherently biconical from the disk to >Mpc. The CR-driven outflows are primarily cool (T ∼ 105 K) and low-velocity. All of these effects weaken and eventually vanish at lower halo masses (≲ 1011 M⊙) or higher redshifts (z ≳ 1 − 2), reflecting the ratio of CR to thermal+gravitational pressure in the outer halo. We present a simple analytic model which explains all of the above phenomena. We caution that these predictions may depend on uncertain CR transport physics.},

 We present a comparison of the physical properties of the ionized gas in the circumgalactic medium and intergalactic medium (IGM) at z ∼ 0 between observations and four cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: Illustris, TNG300 of the IllustrisTNG project, EAGLE, and one of the Magneticum simulations. For the observational data, we use the gas properties that are inferred from cross-correlating the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect (SZE) from the Planck CMB maps with haloes and large-scale structure. Both the observational and simulation results indicate that the integrated gas pressure in haloes deviates from the self-similar case, showing that feedback impacts haloes with $M_{500}\sim 10^{12\!-\!13}\, {\rm M_\odot }$. The simulations predict that more than half the baryons are displaced from haloes, while the gas fraction inferred from our observational data roughly equals the cosmic baryon fraction throughout the $M_{500}\sim 10^{12\!-\!14.5}\, {\rm M_\odot }$ halo mass range. All simulations tested here predict that the mean gas temperature in haloes is about the virial temperature, while that inferred from the SZE is up to one order of magnitude lower than that from the simulations (and also from X-ray observations). While a remarkable agreement is found for the average properties of the IGM between the observation and some simulations, we show that their dependence on the large-scale tidal field can break the degeneracy between models that show similar predictions otherwise. Finally, we show that the gas pressure and the electron density profiles from simulations are not well described by a generalized NFW profile. Instead, we present a new model with a mass-dependent shape that fits the profiles accurately.},

 The quenching ‘maintenance’ and ‘cooling flow’ problems are important from the Milky Way through massive cluster elliptical galaxies. Previous work has shown that some source of energy beyond that from stars and pure magnetohydrodynamic processes is required, perhaps from active galactic nuclei, but even the qualitative form of this energetic input remains uncertain. Different scenarios include thermal ‘heating’, direct wind or momentum injection, cosmic ray heating or pressure support, or turbulent ‘stirring’ of the intracluster medium (ICM). We investigate these in $10^{12}\!-\!10^{14}\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$ haloes using high-resolution non-cosmological simulations with the FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) stellar feedback model, including simplified toy energy injection models, where we arbitrarily vary the strength, injection scale, and physical form of the energy. We explore which scenarios can quench without violating observational constraints on energetics or ICM gas. We show that turbulent stirring in the central $\sim 100\,$ kpc, or cosmic ray injection, can both maintain a stable low-star formation rate halo for >Gyr time-scales with modest energy input, by providing a non-thermal pressure that stably lowers the core density and cooling rates. In both cases, associated thermal-heating processes are negligible. Turbulent stirring preserves cool-core features while mixing condensed core gas into the hotter halo and is by far the most energy efficient model. Pure thermal heating or nuclear isotropic momentum injection require vastly larger energy, are less efficient in lower mass haloes, easily overheat cores, and require fine tuning to avoid driving unphysical temperature gradients or gas expulsion from the halo centre.},

We utilise TNG50 of the IllustrisTNG project, as well as the EAGLE simulation to show that observable properties of CGM gas correlate with azimuthal angle, defined as the galiocentric angle with respect to the central galaxy. Both simulations are in remarkable agreement in predicting a strong modulation of flow rate direction with azimuthal angle: inflow is more substantial along the galaxy major axis, while outflow is strongest along the minor axis. The absolute rates are noticeably larger for higher (log(M_* / M_sun) ~ 10.5) stellar mass galaxies, up to an order of magnitude compared to M^dot 100 kpc. Our results present a global picture whereby, despite the numerous mixing processes, there is a clear angular dependence of the CGM metallicity. We make forecasts for future large survey programs that will be able to compare against these expectations. Indeed, characterising the kinematics, spatial distribution and metal content of CGM gas is key to a full understanding of the exchange of mass, metals, and energy between galaxies and their surrounding environments.},

 We present the implementation and the first results of cosmic ray (CR) feedback in the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. We investigate CR feedback in non-cosmological simulations of dwarf, sub-L⋆ starburst, and L⋆ galaxies with different propagation models, including advection, isotropic, and anisotropic diffusion, and streaming along field lines with different transport coefficients. We simulate CR diffusion and streaming simultaneously in galaxies with high resolution, using a two-moment method. We forward-model and compare to observations of γ-ray emission from nearby and starburst galaxies. We reproduce the γ-ray observations of dwarf and L⋆ galaxies with constant isotropic diffusion coefficient $\kappa \sim 3\times 10^{29}\, {\rm cm^{2}\, s^{-1}}$. Advection-only and streaming-only models produce order of magnitude too large γ-ray luminosities in dwarf and L⋆ galaxies. We show that in models that match the γ-ray observations, most CRs escape low-gas-density galaxies (e.g. dwarfs) before significant collisional losses, while starburst galaxies are CR proton calorimeters. While adiabatic losses can be significant, they occur only after CRs escape galaxies, so they are only of secondary importance for γ-ray emissivities. Models where CRs are ‘trapped’ in the star-forming disc have lower star formation efficiency, but these models are ruled out by γ-ray observations. For models with constant κ that match the γ-ray observations, CRs form extended haloes with scale heights of several kpc to several tens of kpc.},

This turnover supports the hypothesis that the oxygen originates in the central galaxies.

Circumgalactic gas within this radius cools in less than 1 Gyr and radiates erg s−1 overall. The feedback power necessary to maintain such oxygen-rich atmospheres for many Gyr cannot be easily supplied by galactic supernovae. However, massive central black holes in star-forming galaxies may generate sufficient accretion power and intermittent shock waves at to balance circumgalactic radiation losses in late-type galaxies. The relative absence of O vi absorption observed in early-type, passive galaxies may arise from enhanced AGN feedback from their more massive central black holes.},

 The inflow of cosmological gas on to haloes, while challenging to directly observe and quantify, plays a fundamental role in the baryon cycle of galaxies. Using the eagle suite of hydrodynamical simulations, we present a thorough exploration of the physical properties of gas accreting on to haloes – namely, its spatial characteristics, density, temperature, and metallicity. Classifying accretion as ‘hot’ or ‘ cold’ based on a temperature cut-off 105.5 K, we find that the covering fraction (fcov) of cold-mode accreting gas is significantly lower than the hot-mode, with z = 0 fcov values of ${\approx}50{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ and ${\approx}80{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$, respectively. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in eagle reduces inflow fcov values by ${\approx}10{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$, with outflows decreasing the solid angle available for accretion flows. Classifying inflow by particle history, we find that gas on first-infall on to a halo is metal depleted by ≈2 dex compared to pre-processed gas, which we find to mimic the circum-galactic medium (CGM) in terms of metal content. We also show that high (low) halo-scale gas accretion rates are associated with metal-poor (rich) CGM in haloes below $10^{12}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$, and that variation in halo-scale gas accretion rates may offer a physical explanation for the enhanced scatter in the star-forming main sequence at low (${\lesssim}10^{9}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) and high (${\gtrsim}10^{10}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) stellar masses. Our results highlight how gas inflow influences several halo- and galaxy-scale properties, and the need to combine kinematic and chemical data in order to confidently break the degeneracy between accreting and outgoing gas in CGM observations.},

 abstract = {We study the rate at which gas accretes on to galaxies and haloes and investigate whether the accreted gas was shocked to high temperatures before reaching a galaxy. For this purpose we use a suite of large cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the OWLS project. We improve on previous work by considering a wider range of halo masses and redshifts, by distinguishing accretion on to haloes and galaxies, by including important feedback processes, and by comparing simulations with different physics. Gas accretion is mostly smooth, with mergers only becoming important for groups and clusters. The specific rate of gas accretion on to haloes is, like that for dark matter, only weakly dependent on halo mass. For halo masses Mhalo � 10 11 Mit is relatively insensitive to feedback processes. In contrast, accretion rates on to galaxies are determined by radiative cooling and by outflows driven by supernovae and active galactic nuclei. Galactic winds increase the halo mass at which the central galaxies grow the fastest by about two orders of magnitude to Mhalo � 10 12 M� . Gas accretion is bimodal, with maximum past temperatures either of order the virial temperature or . 10 5 K. The fraction of gas accreted on to haloes in the hot mode is insensitive to feedback and metal-line cooling. It increases with redshift, but is mostly determined by halo mass, increasing gradually from less than 10% for � 10 11 Mto greater than 90% at � 10 13 M� . In contrast, for accretion on to galaxies the cold mode is always significant and the relative contributions of the two accretion modes are more sensitive to feedback and metal-line cooling. On average, the majority of stars present in any mass halo at any redshift were formed from gas accreted in the cold mode, although the hot mode contributes typically over 10% for Mhalo & 10 11 M� . Thus, while gas accretion on to haloes can be robustly predicted, the rate of accretion on to galaxies is sensitive to uncertain feedback processes. Nevertheless, it is clear that galaxies, but not their gaseous haloes, are predominantly fed by gas that did not experience an accretion shock when it entered the host halo.},

We study the z = 0 gas kinematics, morphology and angular momentum content of isolated galaxies in a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations from the FIRE project spanning Mstar = 106-11M⊙. Gas becomes increasingly rotationally supported with increasing galaxy mass. In the lowest mass galaxies (Mstar l 108M⊙), gas fails to form a morphological disc and is primarily dispersion and pressure supported. At intermediate masses (Mstar = 108-10M⊙), galaxies display a wide range of gas kinematics and morphologies, from thin, rotating discs to irregular spheroids with negligible net rotation. All the high-mass (Mstar = 1010-11M⊙) galaxies form rotationally supported gas discs. Many of the haloes whose galaxies fail to form discs harbour high angular momentum gas in their circumgalactic medium. The ratio of the specific angular momentum of gas in the central galaxy to that of the dark matter halo increases significantly with galaxy mass, from 〈jgas〉/〈jDM〉 ~ 0.1 at Mstar = 106-7M⊙ to 〈jgas〉/〈jDM〉 ~ 2 at Mstar = 1010-11M⊙. The reduced rotational support in the lowest mass galaxies owes to (a) stellar feedback and the UV background suppressing the accretion of high angular momentum gas at late times, and (b) stellar feedback driving large non-circular gas motions. We broadly reproduce the observed scaling relations between galaxy mass, gas rotation velocity, size and angular momentum, but may somewhat underpredict the incidence of disky, high angular momentum galaxies at the lowest observed masses (Mstar = (106- 2 × 107) M⊙). Stars form preferentially from low angular momentum gas near the galactic centre and are less rotationally supported than gas. The common assumption that stars follow the same rotation curve as gas thus substantially overestimates the simulated galaxies' stellar angular momentum, particularly at low masses.},

 abstract = {We present an analytic model for how momentum deposition from stellar feedback simultaneously regulates star formation and drives outflows in a turbulent interstellar medium (ISM). Because the ISM is turbulent, a given patch of ISM exhibits sub-patches with a range of surface densities. The high-density patches are ‘pushed’ by feedback, thereby driving turbulence and self-regulating local star formation. Sufficiently low-density patches, however, are accelerated to above the escape velocity before the region can self-adjust and are thus vented as outflows. When the gas fraction is ≳ 0.3, the ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the circular velocity is sufficiently high that at any given time, of the order of half of the ISM has surface density less than the critical value and thus can be blown out on a dynamical time. The resulting outflows have a mass-loading factor (η≡M_(out)/M_⋆) that is inversely proportional to the gas fraction times the circular velocity. At low gas fractions, the star formation rate needed for local self-regulation, and corresponding turbulent Mach number, declines rapidly; the ISM is ‘smoother’, and it is actually more difficult to drive winds with large mass-loading factors. Crucially, our model predicts that stellar-feedback-driven outflows should be suppressed at z≲1 in M_⋆≳10^(10)M_⊙ galaxies. This mechanism allows massive galaxies to exhibit violent outflows at high redshifts and then ‘shut down’ those outflows at late times, thereby enabling the formation of a smooth, extended thin stellar disc. We provide simple fitting functions for η that should be useful for sub-resolution and semi-analytic models.},

 abstract = {Low-mass “dwarf” galaxies represent the most significant challenges to the cold dark matter (CDM) model of cosmological structure formation. Because these faint galaxies are (best) observed within the Local Group (LG) of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31), understanding their formation in such an environment is critical. We present first results from the Latte Project: the Milky Way on Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE). This simulation models the formation of an MW-mass galaxy to z = 0 within ΛCDM cosmology, including dark matter, gas, and stars at unprecedented resolution: baryon particle mass of 7070 M ⊙ with gas kernel/softening that adapts down to 1 pc (with a median of 25 – 60 pc at z = 0 ). Latte was simulated using the GIZMO code with a mesh-free method for accurate hydrodynamics and the FIRE-2 model for star formation and explicit feedback within a multi-phase interstellar medium. For the first time, Latte self-consistently resolves the spatial scales corresponding to half-light radii of dwarf galaxies that form around an MW-mass host down to M star ≳ 10 5 M ⊙ . Latte’s population of dwarf galaxies agrees with the LG across a broad range of properties: (1) distributions of stellar masses and stellar velocity dispersions (dynamical masses), including their joint relation; (2) the mass–metallicity relation; and (3) diverse range of star formation histories, including their mass dependence. Thus, Latte produces a realistic population of dwarf galaxies at M star ≳ 10 5 M ⊙ that does not suffer from the “missing satellites” or “too big to fail” problems of small-scale structure formation. We conclude that baryonic physics can reconcile observed dwarf galaxies with standard ΛCDM cosmology.},

These simulations model stellar feedback by supernovae, stellar winds and radiation, and BH growth using a gravitational torque-based prescription tied to the resolved properties of galactic nuclei. We do not include BH feedback. We show that early BH growth occurs through short (≲1 Myr) accretion episodes that can reach or even exceed the Eddington rate. In this regime, BH growth is limited by bursty stellar feedback continuously evacuating gas from galactic nuclei, and BHs remain undermassive in low-mass galaxies relative to the local MBH–Mbulgerelation. BH growth is more efficient at later times, when the nuclear stellar potential retains a significant gas reservoir, star formation becomes less bursty and galaxies settle into a more ordered state. BHs rapidly converge on to the observed scaling relations when the host reaches Mbulge ∼ 1010 M⊙. We show that resolving the effects of stellar feedback on the gas supply in the inner ∼100 pc of galaxies is necessary to accurately capture the growth of central BHs. Our simulations imply that bursty stellar feedback has important implications for BH–galaxy relations, AGN demographics and time variability, the formation of early quasars and massive BH mergers.},

 abstract = {We present an analysis of the flow of metals through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations of galaxy formation, ranging from isolated dwarfs to L* galaxies. We find that nearly all metals produced in high-redshift galaxies are carried out in winds that reach 0.25R_(vir). When measured at 0.25R_(vir) the metallicity of outflows is slightly higher than the interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity. Many metals thus reside in the CGM. Cooling and recycling from this reservoir determine the metal budget in the ISM. The outflowing metal flux decreases by a factor of ∼2–5 between 0.25R_(vir) and R_(vir). Furthermore, outflow metallicity is typically lower at R_(vir) owing to dilution of the remaining outflow by metal-poor material swept up from the CGM. The inflow metallicity at R_(vir) is generally low, but outflow and inflow metallicities are similar in the inner halo. At low redshift, massive galaxies no longer generate outflows that reach the CGM, causing a divergence in CGM and ISM metallicity. Dwarf galaxies continue to generate outflows, although they preferentially retain metal ejecta. In all but the least massive galaxy considered, a majority of the metals are within the halo at z = 0. We measure the fraction of metals in CGM, ISM and stars, and quantify the thermal state of CGM metals in each halo. The total amount of metals in the low-redshift CGM of two simulated L* galaxies is consistent with estimates from the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph haloes survey, while for the other two it appears to be lower.},

The cosmology module implements Friedman–Lemaitre–Robertson–Walker cosmologies including curvature, relativistic species, and different dark energy equations of state, and provides fast computations of the linear matter power spectrum, variance, and correlation function. The LSS module is concerned with the properties of peaks in Gaussian random fields and halos in a statistical sense, including their peak height, peak curvature, halo bias, and mass function. The halo module deals with spherical overdensity radii and masses, density profiles, concentration, and the splashback radius. To facilitate the rapid exploration of these quantities, Colossus implements more than 40 different fitting functions from the literature. I discuss the core routines in detail, with particular emphasis on their accuracy. Colossus is available at bitbucket.org/bdiemer/colossus.},

 We use the eagle suite of hydrodynamical simulations to analyse accretion rates (and the breakdown of their constituent channels) on to haloes over cosmic time, comparing the behaviour of baryons and dark matter (DM). We also investigate the influence of sub-grid baryon physics on halo-scale inflow, specifically the consequences of modelling radiative cooling, as well as feedback from stars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We find that variations in halo baryon fractions at fixed mass (particularly their circumgalactic medium gas content) are very well correlated with variations in the baryon fraction of accreting matter, which we show to be heavily suppressed by stellar feedback in low-mass haloes, Mhalo ≲ 1011.5 M⊙. Breaking down accretion rates into first infall, recycled, transfer, and merger components, we show that baryons are much more likely to be smoothly accreted than to have originated from mergers when compared to DM, finding (averaged across halo mass) a merger contribution of $\approx 6{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for baryons, and $\approx 15{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for DM at z ≈ 0. We also show that the breakdown of inflow into different channels is strongly dependent on sub-grid physics, particularly the contribution of recycled accretion (accreting matter that has been previously ejected from progenitor haloes). Our findings highlight the dual role that baryonic feedback plays in regulating the evolution of galaxies and haloes: by (i) directly removing gas from haloes, and (ii) suppressing gas inflow to haloes.},

 abstract = {We present new results on the kinematics and spatial distribution of metal-enriched gas within ∼125 kpc of star-forming (“Lyman break”) galaxies at redshifts 2 ≲ z ≲ 3. In particular, we focus on constraints provided by the rest-frame far-ultraviolet (far-UV) spectra of faint galaxies, and demonstrate how galaxy spectra can be used to obtain key spatial and spectral information more efficiently than possible with QSO sightlines. Using a sample of 89 galaxies with 〈z〉 = 2.3 ± 0.3 and with both rest-frame far-UV and Hα spectra, we re-calibrate the measurement of accurate galaxy systemic redshifts using only survey-quality rest-UV spectra. We use the velocity-calibrated sample to investigate the kinematics of the galaxy-scale outflows via the strong interstellar (IS) absorption lines and Lyα emission (when present), as well as their dependence on other physical properties of the galaxies. We construct a sample of 512 close (1″–15″) angular pairs of z ∼ 2–3 galaxies with redshift differences indicating a lack of physical association. Sightlines to the background galaxies provide new information on the spatial distribution of circumgalactic gas surrounding the foreground galaxies. The close pairs sample galactocentric impact parameters 3–125 kpc (physical) at 〈z〉 = 2.2, providing for the first time a robust map of cool gas as a function of galactocentric distance for a well-characterized population of galaxies. We propose a simple model of circumgalactic gas that simultaneously matches the kinematics, depth, and profile shape of IS absorption and Lyα emission lines, as well as the observed variation of absorption line strength (H i and several metallic species) versus galactocentric impact parameter. Within the model, cool gas is distributed symmetrically around every galaxy, accelerating radially outward with vout(r) increasing with r (i.e., the highest velocities are located at the largest galactocentric distances r). The inferred radial dependence of the covering fraction of cool gas (which modulates the absorption line strength) is fc(r) ∝ r−γ with 0.2 ≲ γ ≲ 0.6 depending on transition. We discuss the results of the observations in the context of “cold accretion,” in which cool gas is accreting via filamentary streams directly onto the central regions of galaxies. At present, we find little observational evidence for cool infalling material, while evidence supporting the large-scale effects of superwind outflows is strong. This “pilot” study using faint galaxy spectra demonstrates the potential of using galaxies to trace baryons within galaxies, in the circumgalactic medium, and ultimately throughout the intergalactic medium.},

For the full sample spanning z = 2.2–5 (738 DLAs), f(NH i, X) is well fitted by a double power law with a break column density Nd = 1021.55±0.04 cm-2 and low/high-end exponents α = −2.00 ± 0.05, − 6.4+1.1−1.6. The shape of f(NH i, X) is invariant during this redshift interval and also follows the projected surface density distribution of present-day H i disks as inferred from 21 cm observations. We conclude that H i gas has been distributed in a self-similar fashion for the past 12 Gyr. The normalization of f(NH i, X), in contrast, decreases by a factor of 2 during the ≈2 Gyr interval from z = 4–2.2 with coincident decreases in both the total covering fraction and ρH i. At z ≈ 2, these quantities match the present-day values suggesting no evolution during the past ≈10 Gyr. We argue that the evolution at early times is driven by “violent” processes that removes gas from nearly half the galaxies at z ≈ 3 establishing the antecedents of current early-type galaxies. The perceived constancy of ρH i, meanwhile, implies that H i gas is a necessary but insufficient precondition for star formation and that the global star formation rate is driven by the accretion and condensation of fresh gas from the intergalactic medium.},

From our full sample of 130 metal-bearing absorbers, we infer that halo gas is kinematically complex when viewed in singly, doubly, and triply ionized species. Broad O vi and C iv absorbers are detected at velocities similar to the lower-ionization gas but with a very different kinematic structure, indicating that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is multiphase. There is a high covering fraction of metal-bearing gas within 100 kpc, including highly ionized gas such as O vi; however, observations of a single galaxy probed by a lensed background QSO suggest the size of metal-bearing clouds is small (<400 pc for all but the O vi-bearing gas). The mass in metals found within the halo is substantial, equivalent to ≳25% of the metal mass within the interstellar medium. The gas kinematics unambiguously show that 70% of galaxies with detected metal absorption have some unbound metal-enriched gas, suggesting galactic winds may commonly eject gas from halos at z ∼ 2. When modeled assuming that ions with different ionization potentials can originate within a single gaseous structure, significant thermal broadening is detected in CGM absorbers that dominates the internal energy of the gas. Some 40% of the detected gas has temperatures in the range 104.5–5.5 K where cooling times are short, suggesting the CGM is dynamic, with constant heating or cooling to produce this short-lived thermal phase.},

 abstract = {We describe the kinematics of circumgalactic gas near the galactic plane, combining new measurements of galaxy rotation curves and spectroscopy of background quasars. The sightlines pass within 19–93 kpc of the target galaxy and generally detect Mg ii absorption. The Mg ii Doppler shifts have the same sign as the galactic rotation, so the cold gas co-rotates with the galaxy. Because the absorption spans a broader velocity range than disk rotation can explain, we explore simple models for the circumgalactic kinematics. Gas spiraling inwards (near the disk plane) offers a successful description of the observations. An appendix describes the addition of tangential and radial gas flows and illustrates how the sign of the disk inclination produces testable differences in the projected line-of-sight velocity range. This inflow interpretation implies that cold flow disks remain common down to redshift z ≈ 0.2 and prolong star formation by supplying gas to the disk.},

 abstract = {We propose a simple analytic model to understand when star formation is time-steady versus bursty in galaxies. Recent models explain the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation between star formation rate and gas surface densities in galaxies as resulting from a balance between stellar feedback and gravity. We argue that bursty star formation occurs when such an equilibrium cannot be stably sustained, and identify two regimes in which galaxy-scale star formation should be bursty: i) at high redshift (z>~1) for galaxies of all masses, and ii) at low masses (depending on gas fraction) for galaxies at any redshift. At high redshift, characteristic galactic dynamical timescales become too short for supernova feedback to effectively respond to gravitational collapse in galactic discs (an effect recently identified for galactic nuclei), whereas in dwarf galaxies star formation occurs in too few bright star-forming regions to effectively average out. Burstiness is also enhanced at high redshift owing to elevated gas fractions in the early Universe. Our model can thus explain the bursty star formation rates predicted in these regimes by recent high-resolution galaxy formation simulations, as well as the bursty star formation histories observationally-inferred in both local dwarf and high-redshift galaxies. In our model, bursty star formation is associated with particularly strong spatio-temporal clustering of supernovae. Such clustering can promote the formation of galactic winds and our model may thus also explain the much higher wind mass loading factors inferred in high-redshift massive galaxies relative to their z~0 counterparts.},

 abstract = {The thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (SZ) effect and soft X-ray emission are routinely observed around massive galaxies and in galaxy groups and clusters. We study these observational diagnostics of galaxy haloes for a suite of cosmological ‘zoom-in’ simulations from the ‘Feedback In Realistic Environments’ project, which spans a large range in halo mass (10^(10–13) M_⊙). We explore the effect of stellar feedback on the hot gas observables. The properties of our simulated groups, such as baryon fractions, SZ flux, and X-ray luminosities (LX), are broadly consistent with existing observations, even though feedback from active galactic nuclei is not included. We make predictions for future observations of lower mass objects for both SZ and diffuse X-ray measurements, finding that they are not just scaled-down versions of massive galaxies, but more strongly affected by galactic winds driven by star formation. Low-mass haloes (≲ 10^(11) M_⊙) retain a low fraction of their baryons, which results in a strong suppression of the SZ signal. Our simulations therefore predict a scaling with halo mass that is steeper than self-similar for haloes less massive than 10^(13) M_⊙. For halo masses ≲ 10^(12) M_⊙, LX is time variable and correlated primarily with the star formation rate (SFR). For these objects, the diffuse X-ray emission is powered mostly by galactic winds and the gas dominating the X-ray emission is flowing out with radial velocities close to the halo's circular velocity. For halo masses ≳ 10^(13) M_⊙, on the other hand, LX is much less variable and not correlated with the SFR, because the emission originates from the quasi-hydrostatic, virialized halo gas.},

 abstract = {The predominantly ancient stellar populations observed in the lowest-mass galaxies (i.e. ultra-faint dwarfs) suggest that their star formation was suppressed by reionization. Most of the well-studied ultra-faint dwarfs, however, are within the central half of the Milky Way dark matter halo, such that they are consistent with a population that was accreted at early times and thus potentially quenched via environmental processes. To study the potential role of environment in suppressing star formation on the smallest scales, we utilize the Exploring the Local Volume in Simulations (ELVIS) suite of $N$-body simulations to constrain the distribution of infall times for low-mass subhalos likely to host the ultra-faint population. For the ultra-faint satellites of the Milky Way with star-formation histories inferred from $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ imaging, we find that environment is highly unlikely to play a dominant role in quenching their star formation. Even when including the potential effects of pre-processing, there is a $\lesssim 0.1\%$ probability that environmental processes quenched all of the known ultra-faint dwarfs early enough to explain their observed star-formation histories. Instead, we argue for a mass floor in the effectiveness of satellite quenching at roughly $M_{\star} \sim 10^{5}~M_{\odot}$, below which star formation in surviving galaxies is globally suppressed by reionization. We predict a large population of quenched ultra-faint dwarfs in the Local Field ($1 < R/R_{\rm{vir}} < 2$), with as many as $\sim250$ to be discovered by future wide-field imaging surveys.},

 abstract = {Large reservoirs of cold (∼104 K) gas exist out to and beyond the virial radius in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of all types of galaxies. Photoionization modeling suggests that cold CGM gas has significantly lower densities than expected by theoretical predictions based on thermal pressure equilibrium with hot CGM gas. In this work, we investigate the impact of cosmic-ray physics on the formation of cold gas via thermal instability. We use idealized three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to follow the evolution of thermally unstable gas in a gravitationally stratified medium. We find that cosmic-ray pressure lowers the density and increases the size of cold gas clouds formed through thermal instability. We develop a simple model for how the cold cloud sizes and the relative densities of cold and hot gas depend on cosmic-ray pressure. Cosmic-ray pressure can help counteract gravity to keep cold gas in the CGM for longer, thereby increasing the predicted cold mass fraction and decreasing the predicted cold gas inflow rates. Efficient cosmic-ray transport, by streaming or diffusion, redistributes cosmic-ray pressure from the cold gas to the background medium, resulting in cold gas properties that are in between those predicted by simulations with inefficient transport and simulations without cosmic rays. We show that cosmic rays can significantly reduce galactic accretion rates and resolve the tension between theoretical models and observational constraints on the properties of cold CGM gas.},

 abstract = {Background quasars are potentially sensitive probes of galactic outflows provided that one can determine the origin of the absorbing material since both gaseous disks and strong bipolar outflows can contribute to the absorption cross-section. Using a dozen quasars passing near spectroscopically identified galaxies at z 0:1, we find that the azimuthal orientation of the quasar sight-lines with strong Mg II absorption (withW 2796 r > 0:3 ˚ A) is bi-modal: about half the Mg II sight-lines are aligned with the major axis and the other half are within = 30 of the minor axis, suggesting that bipolar outflows can contribute to the Mg II cross-section. This bi-modality is also present in the instantaneous star-formation rates (SFRs) of the hosts. For the sight-lines aligned along the minor axis, a simple bi-conical wind model is indeed able to reproduce the observed Mg II kinematics and the Mg II dependence with impact parameter b, (W 2796 r / b 1 ). Using our wind model, we can directly extract key wind properties such as the de-projected outflow speed Vout of the cool material traced by Mg II and the outflow rates _ Mout. The outflow speeds Vout are found to be 150-300 kms 1 , i.e. of the order of the circular velocity, and smaller than the escape velocity by a factor of 2. The outflow rates _ Mout are typically two to three times the instantaneous SFRs. Our results demonstrate how background quasars can be used to measure wind properties with high precision.},

As part of the Simulating Multiscale Astrophysics to Understand Galaxies project, we compare predictions from the FIRE-2 hydrodynamical “zoom-in” simulations to those from the Santa Cruz SAM run on the same halo merger trees, with an emphasis on the global mass flow cycle. Our study includes 13 halos spanning low-mass dwarfs (Mvir ∼ 1010M⊙ at z = 0), intermediate-mass dwarfs (Mvir ∼ 1011M⊙), and Milky Way–mass galaxies (Mvir ∼ 1012M⊙). The SAM and FIRE-2 predictions agree relatively well with each other in terms of stellar and interstellar medium mass but differ dramatically on circumgalactic medium mass (the SAM is lower than FIRE-2 by ∼3 orders of magnitude for dwarfs). Strikingly, the SAM predicts higher gas accretion rates for dwarfs compared to FIRE-2 by factors of ∼10–100, and this is compensated for with higher mass outflow rates in the SAM. We argue that the most severe model discrepancies are caused by the lack of preventative stellar feedback and the assumptions for halo gas cooling and recycling in the SAM. As a first step toward resolving these model tensions, we present a simple yet promising new preventative stellar feedback model in which the energy carried by supernova-driven winds is allowed to heat some fraction of gas outside of halos to at least the virial temperature such that accretion is suppressed.},

 abstract = {The Initial Star formation and Lifetimes of Andromeda Satellites (ISLAndS) project employs Hubble Space Telescope imaging to study a representative sample of six Andromeda dSph satellite companion galaxies. Our main goal is to determine whether the star formation histories (SFHs) of the Andromeda dSph satellites demonstrate significant statistical differences from those of the Milky Way (MW). Our deep observations yield a time resolution at the oldest ages of ∼1 Gyr, allowing meaningful comparisons to the MW satellites. The six dSphs present a variety of SFHs (e.g., a significant range in quenching times, τ q , from 9 to 6 Gyr ago) that are not strictly correlated with luminosity or present distance from M31. In agreement with observations of MW companions of similar mass, there is no evidence of complete quenching of star formation by the cosmic UV background responsible for reionization, but the possibility of a degree of quenching at reionization cannot be ruled out. We do not find significant differences between the SFHs of the members and non-members of the vast, thin plane of satellites. The SFHs of the ISLAndS M31 dSphs appear to be more uniform than those of the MW dSphs. Specifically, the primary difference between the SFHs of the ISLAndS dSphs and MW dSph companions of similar luminosities and host distances is the absence of late-quenching ( τ q ≤ 5 Gyr ) dSphs in the ISLAndS sample. Thus, models that can produce satellite populations with and without late-quenching satellites are of extreme interest.},

The simulations of z ≈ 0.2 L* (M200= 1011.7- 1012.3M⊙) haloes hosting star-forming galaxies and group-sized (M200= 1012.7- 1013.3M⊙) haloes hosting mainly passive galaxies reproduce key trends observed by the COS-Halos survey - low ion column densities show 1) little dependence on galaxy-specific star formation rate, 2) a patchy covering fraction indicative of 104K clumps with a small volume filling factor, and 3) a declining covering fraction as impact parameter increases from 20-160kpc. Simulated Si II, Si III, Si IV, CII, and C III column densities show good (mostly within 0.3 dex) agreement with observations, while MgII is under-predicted. Low ions trace a significant metal reservoir, ≈108M⊙, residing primarily at 10-100kpc from star-forming and passive central galaxies. These clumps preferentially flow inwards and most will accrete onto the central galaxy within the next several Gyr, while a small fraction are entrained in strong outflows. A multiphase structure describes the inner CGM ( 0.5R200) tracing virial temperature gas around L* galaxies. Our simulations support previous ionization models indicating that cloud covering factors decline while densities and pressures show little decline with increasing impact parameter (typically < 0.3 dex from 40 to 160 kpc). We find the cool clumps have lower pressures than the ambient medium they are embedded in, and discuss that numerical effects within the hydrodynamic solver likely play a role. © 2018 The Author(s).},

 abstract = {We study the hot and cold circum-galactic medium (CGM) of 86 galaxies of the cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation suite, Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects (NIHAO). NIHAO allows a study of how the z = 0 CGM varies across five orders of magnitude of stellar mass using O VI and HI as proxies for hot and cold gas. The cool HI covering fraction and column density profiles match observations well, particularly in the inner CGM. O VI shows increasing column densities with mass, a trend seemingly echoed in the observations. As in multiple previous simulations, the O VI column densities in simulations are lower than observed and optically thick HI does not extend as far out as in observations. We take a look at the collisional ionization fraction of O VI as a function of halo mass. We make observable predictions of the bipolarity of outflows and their effect on the general shape of the CGM. Bipolar outflows can be seen out to around 40 kpc in intermediate-and low-mass haloes (M-Halo},

 abstract = {We report on the gamma-ray observations of giant molecular clouds Orion A and B with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The gamma-ray emission in the energy band between ∼100 MeV and ∼100 GeV is predicted to trace the gas mass distribution in the clouds through nuclear interactions between the Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) and interstellar gas. The gamma-ray production cross-section for the nuclear interaction is known to ∼10% precision which makes the LAT a powerful tool to measure the gas mass column density distribution of molecular clouds for a known CR intensity. We present here such distributions for Orion A and B, and correlate them with those of the velocity-integrated CO intensity (WCO) at a 1° × 1° pixel level. The correlation is found to be linear over a WCO range of ∼10-fold when divided in three regions, suggesting penetration of nuclear CRs to most of the cloud volumes. The WCO-to-mass conversion factor, XCO, is found to be ∼2.3 × 1020 cm-2(K km s−1)−1 for the high-longitude part of Orion A (l > 212°), ∼1.7 times higher than ∼1.3 × 1020 found for the rest of Orion A and B. We interpret the apparent high XCO in the high-longitude region of Orion A in the light of recent works proposing a nonlinear relation between H2 and CO densities in the diffuse molecular gas. WCO decreases faster than the H2 column density in the region making the gas “darker” to WCO.},

 abstract = {We perform a suite of multimass cosmological zoom simulations of individual dark matter halos and explore how to best select Lagrangian regions for resimulation without contaminating the halo of interest with low-resolution particles. Such contamination can lead to significant errors in the gas distribution of hydrodynamical simulations, as we show. For a fixed Lagrange volume, we find that the chance of contamination increases systematically with the level of zoom. In order to avoid contamination, the Lagrangian volume selected for resimulation must increase monotonically with the resolution difference between parent box and the zoom region. We provide a simple formula for selecting Lagrangian regions (in units of the halo virial volume) as a function of the level of zoom required. We also explore the degree to which a halo's Lagrangian volume correlates with other halo properties (concentration, spin, formation time, shape, etc.) and find no significant correlation. There is a mild correlation between Lagrange volume and environment, such that halos living in the most clustered regions have larger Lagrangian volumes. Nevertheless, selecting halos to be isolated is not the best way to ensure inexpensive zoom simulations. We explain how one can safely choose halos with the smallest Lagrangian volumes, which are the least expensive to resimulate, without biasing one's sample.},

The present scheme applies to cosmogonies where structure grows through hierarchical clustering of a mixture of gas and dissipationless dark matter. The simplest models consistent with the current understanding of N-body work on dissipationless clustering, and that of numerical and analytic work on gas evolution and cooling are adopted. Standard models for the evolution of the stellar population are also employed, and new models for the way star formation heats and enriches the surrounding gas are constructed. Detailed results are presented for a cold dark matter universe with Omega = 1 and H(0) = 50 km/s/Mpc, but the present methods are applicable to other models. The present luminosity functions contain significantly more faint galaxies than are observed.},

The comparison is made for a large number of clusters at a range of redshifts in three different cosmological models (cold plus hot dark matter, cold dark matter, and open cold dark matter). We find that the analytic formulae provide a good description of the relations between three of the four numerical quantities. The fourth (luminosity) also agrees once we introduce a procedure to correct for the fixed numerical resolution. We also compute the normalizations for the virial relations and compare extensively to the existing literature, finding remarkably good agreement. The Press-Schechter prescription is calibrated with the simulations, again finding results consistent with other authors. We also examine related issues such as the size of the scatter in the virial relations, the effect of metallicity with a fixed passband, and the structure of the halos. All of this is done in order to establish a firm groundwork for the use of clusters as cosmological probes. Implications for the models are briefly discussed.},

 We present a comparative analysis of the $\rm CH^+$(1–0) and Lyα lines, observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and Keck telescope, respectively, in the field of the submillimetre-selected galaxy SMM J02399−0136 at z ∼ 2.8, which comprises a heavily obscured starburst galaxy and a broad absorption line quasar, immersed in a large Lyα nebula. This comparison highlights the critical role played by turbulence in channelling the energy across gas phases and scales, splitting the energy trail between hot/thermal and cool/turbulent phases in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The unique chemical and spectroscopic properties of $\rm CH^+$ are used to infer the existence of a massive (∼3.5 × 1010 M⊙), highly turbulent reservoir of diffuse molecular gas of radius ∼20 kpc coinciding with the core of the Lyα nebula. The whole cool and cold CGM is shown to be inflowing towards the galaxies at a velocity ∼ 400 km s−1. Several kpc-scale shocks are detected tentatively in $\rm CH^+$ emission. Their linewidth and specific location in space and velocity with respect to the high-velocity Lyα emission suggest that they lie at the interface of the inflowing CGM and the high-velocity outflowing gas. They signpost the feeding of CGM turbulence by active galactic nuclei- and stellar-driven outflows. The mass and energy budgets of the CGM require net mass accretion at a rate commensurate with the star formation rate. From this similarity, we infer that the merger-driven burst of star formation and black-hole growth are ultimately fuelled by large-scale gas accretion.},

 abstract = {Observations of quasar pairs reveal that quasar host halos at z ~ 2 have large covering fractions of cool dense gas (≳ 60% for Lyman limit systems within a projected virial 
radius). Most simulations have so far failed to explain these large observed covering fractions. We analyze a new set of 15 simulated massive halos with explicit stellar 
feedback from the FIRE project, covering the halo mass range M_h ≈ 2 x 10^(12) - 10^(13) M_☉ at z = 2. This extends our previous analysis of the circum-galactic medium of high-redshift galaxies to more massive halos. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is not included in these simulations. We find covering fractions consistent with 
those observed around z ~ 2 quasars. The large HI covering fractions arise from star formation-driven galactic winds, including winds from low-mass satellite galaxies that 
interact with the cosmological infalling filaments in which they are typically embedded. The simulated covering fractions increase with both halo mass and redshift over 
the ranges covered, as well as with resolution. Our simulations predict that galaxies occupying dark matter halos of mass similar to quasars but without a luminous 
AGN should have Lyman limit system covering fractions comparable to quasars. This prediction can be tested by measuring covering fractions transverse to sub-millimeter 
galaxies or to more quiescent galaxies selected based on their high stellar mass.},

By doing so, we extract the properties of galaxies associated with absorbers from redshift 0.4 to 1.3 with effectively $\sim 15,000$ pairs and explore the covering fraction of MgII absorbers as a function of galaxy type, stellar mass, impact parameter, and redshift. We find that the gas covering fraction increases with stellar mass of galaxies by $\sim M_{*}^{0.4}$. However, after we normalize the impact parameter by the virial radius of dark matter halos, the gas profiles around galaxies with masses ranging from $10^{9}$ to $10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$ become weakly dependent on stellar mass. In addition, the gas distribution depends on galaxy type: the covering fraction within $0.3 \, r_{vir}$ around star-forming galaxies is 2-4 times higher than that around passive galaxies at all redshifts. We find that the covering fraction of strong absorbers ($W_{\lambda2796}>1$ Angstrom) around both types of galaxies evolves significantly with redshift, similarly to the evolution of star-formation rate of galaxies, while such an evolution is not detected for weak absorbers ($W_{\lambda2796}<1$ Angstrom). We quantify the HI mass traced by strong absorbers and find that the gas mass around galaxies evolves consistently with the star-formation rate of galaxies. This result suggests that the properties of galaxies and their CGM co-evolve through cosmic time. Finally, we discuss the origins of strong absorbers around passive galaxies and argue that its redshift evolution may trace the star-formation activity of satellite galaxies.},

 We present the first set of cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations of galaxies including dissipative self-interacting dark matter (dSIDM). These simulations utilize the Feedback In Realistic Environments galaxy formation physics, but allow the dark matter to have dissipative self-interactions analogous to standard model forces, parametrized by the self-interaction cross-section per unit mass, (σ/m), and the dimensionless degree of dissipation, 0 < fdiss < 1. We survey this parameter space, including constant and velocity-dependent cross-sections, and focus on structural and kinematic properties of dwarf galaxies with $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{10-11}{\, \rm M_\odot }$ and $M_{\ast } \sim 10^{5-8}{\, \rm M_\odot }$. Central density profiles (parametrized as ρ ∝ rα) of simulated dwarfs become cuspy when $(\sigma /m)_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 0.1\, {\rm cm^{2}\, g^{-1}}$ (and fdiss = 0.5 as fiducial). The power-law slopes asymptote to α ≈ −1.5 in low-mass dwarfs independent of cross-section, which arises from a dark matter ‘cooling flow’. Through comparisons with dark matter only simulations, we find the profile in this regime is insensitive to the inclusion of baryons. However, when $(\sigma /m)_{\rm eff} \ll 0.1\, {\rm cm^{2}\, g^{-1}}$, baryonic effects can produce cored density profiles comparable to non-dissipative cold dark matter (CDM) runs but at smaller radii. Simulated galaxies with $(\sigma /m) \gtrsim 10\, {\rm cm^{2}\, g^{-1}}$ and the fiducial fdiss develop significant coherent rotation of dark matter, accompanied by halo deformation, but this is unlike the well-defined thin ‘dark discs’ often attributed to baryon-like dSIDM. The density profiles in this high cross-section model exhibit lower normalizations given the onset of halo deformation. For our surveyed dSIDM parameters, halo masses and galaxy stellar masses do not show appreciable difference from CDM, but dark matter kinematics and halo concentrations/shapes can differ.},

We explore two matched sets of cosmological zoom-in runs of 24 halos with masses ∼1012.0–1013.4 M⊙ run with two different feedback models. Our “NoAGN” model includes stellar feedback via UV heating, stellar winds and supernovae, photoelectric heating, and cosmic X-ray background heating from a metagalactic background. Our fiducial “MrAGN” model is identical except that it also includes a model for black hole seeding and accretion, as well as heating and momentum injection associated with the radiation from black hole accretion. Our MrAGN model launches galactic outflows, which result in both “ejective” feedback—the outflows themselves that drive gas out of galaxies—and “preventative” feedback, which suppresses the inflow of new and recycling gas. As much as 80% of outflowing galactic gas can be expelled, and accretion can be suppressed by as much as a factor of 30 in the MrAGN runs when compared with the NoAGN runs. The histories of NoAGN galaxies are recycling dominated, with ∼70% of material that leaves the galaxy eventually returning, and the majority of outflowing gas reaccretes on 1 Gyr timescales without AGN feedback. Outflowing gas in the MrAGN runs has a higher characteristic velocity (500–1000 km s−1 versus 100–300 km s−1 for outflowing NoAGN gas) and travels as far as a few megaparsecs. Only ∼10% of ejected material is reaccreted in the MrAGN galaxies.},

 abstract = {We report on the internal distribution of star formation efficiency in IRAS 08339+6517 (hereafter IRAS08), using ∼200 pc resolution CO(2 − 1) observations from NOEMA. The molecular gas depletion time changes by 2 orders-of-magnitude from disk-like values in the outer parts to less than 108 yr inside the half-light radius. This translates to a star formation efficiency per freefall time that also changes by 2 orders-of-magnitude, reaching 50%–100%, different than local spiral galaxies and the typical assumption of constant, low star formation efficiencies. Our target is a compact, massive disk galaxy that has a star formation rate 10× above the z = 0 main sequence; Toomre Q ≈ 0.5−0.7 and high gas velocity dispersion (σ mol ≈ 25 km s−1). We find that IRAS08 is similar to other rotating, starburst galaxies from the literature in the resolved ΣSFR∝ΣmolN relation. By combining resolved literature studies we find that the distance from the main sequence is a strong indicator of the Kennicutt-Schmidt power-law slope, with slopes of N ≈ 1.6 for starbursts from 100 to 104 M ⊙ pc−2. Our target is consistent with a scenario in which violent disk instabilities drive rapid inflows of gas. It has low values of Toomre-Q, and also at all radii, the inflow timescale of the gas is less than the depletion time, which is consistent with the flat metallicity gradients in IRAS08. We consider these results in light of popular star formation theories; in general observations of IRAS08 find the most tension with theories in which star formation efficiency is a constant. Our results argue for the need of high-spatial-resolution CO observations for a larger number of similar targets.},

 abstract = {We have obtained moderate resolution (R = few thousand) spectra of the Na I λλ5890, 5896 (Na D) absorption line in a sample of 32 far-IR-bright starburst galaxies. In 18 cases, the Na D line in the nucleus is produced primarily by interstellar gas, while cool stars contribute significantly in the others. In 12 of the 18 "interstellar-dominated" cases the Na D line is blueshifted by over 100 km s-1 relative to the galaxy systemic velocity (the "outflow sources"), while no case shows a net redshift of more than 100 km s-1. The absorption-line profiles in these outflow sources span the range from near the galaxy systemic velocity to a maximum blueshift of ∼400-600 km s-1. The outflow sources are galaxies systematically viewed more nearly face-on than the others. We therefore argue that the absorbing material consists of ambient interstellar material that has been entrained and accelerated along the minor axis of the galaxy by a hot starburst-driven superwind. The Na D lines are optically thick, but indirect arguments imply total hydrogen column densities of NH ∼ few × 1021 cm-2. This implies that the superwind is expelling matter at a rate comparable to the star formation rate. This outflowing material is evidently very dusty: we find a strong correlation between the depth of the Na D profile and the line-of-sight reddening. Typical implied values are E(B-V) = 0.3-1 over regions several-to-10 kpc in size. We briefly consider some of the potential implications of these observations. The estimated terminal velocities of superwinds inferred from the present data and extant X-ray data are typically 400-800 km-1, are independent of the galaxy rotation speed, and are comparable to (substantially exceed) the escape velocities for L* (dwarf) galaxies. The resulting selective loss of metals from shallower potential wells can establish the mass-metallicity relation in spheroids, produce the observed metallicity in the intracluster medium, and enrich a general IGM to of order 10-1 solar metallicity. If the outflowing dust grains can survive their journey into the IGM, their effect on observations of cosmologically distant objects would be significant.},

 abstract = {We analyze circumgalactic medium (CGM) in a suite of high-resolution cosmological re-simulations of a Milky-Way size galaxy and show that CGM properties are quite sensitive to details of star formation--feedback loop modelling. The simulation that produces a realistic late-type galaxy, fails to reproduce existing observations of the CGM. In contrast, simulation that does not produce a realistic galaxy has the predicted CGM in better agreement with observations. This illustrates that properties of galaxies and properties of their CGM provide strong ${\it complementary}$ constraints on the processes governing galaxy formation. Our simulations predict that column density profiles of ions are well described by an exponential function of projected distance $d$: $N \propto e^{-d/h_s}$. Simulations thus indicate that the sharp drop in absorber detections at larger distances in observations does not correspond to a "boundary" of an ion, but reflects the underlying steep exponential column density profile. Furthermore, we find that ionization energy of ions is tightly correlated with the scale height $h_s$: $h_s \propto E_{\rm ion}^{0.74}$. At $z \approx 0$, warm gas traced by low-ionization species (e.g., Mg II and C IV) has $ h_s \approx 0.03-0.07 R_{\rm vir}$, while higher ionization species (O VI and Ne VIII) have $h_s \approx 0.32-0.45R_{\rm vir}$. Finally, the scale heights of ions in our simulations evolve slower than the virial radius for $z\leq 2$, but similarly to the halo scale radius, $r_s$. Thus, we suggest that the column density profiles of galaxies at different redshifts should be scaled by $r_s$ rather than the halo virial radius.},

 abstract = {The kinematics of MgII absorbers is the key to understanding the origin of cool, metalenriched gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium of massive quiescent galaxies. Exploiting the fact that the cloud line-of-sight velocity distribution is the only unknown for predicting the redshift–space distortion (RSD) of MgII absorbers from their 3D real–space distribution around galaxies, we develop a novel method to infer the cool cloud kinematics from the redshift–space galaxy–cloud cross–correlation ξ . We measure ξ for ∼104 MgII absorbers around ∼8×105 CMASS galaxies at 0.4<z<0.8. We discover that ξ does not exhibit a strong Fingers-of-God effect, but is heavily truncated at velocity ∼300 km s−1. We reconstruct both the redshift and real–space cloud number density distributions inside haloes, ξ 1h and ξ1h , respectively. Thus, for anymodel of cloud kinematics,we can predict ξ 1h from the reconstructed ξ1h , and self–consistently compare to the observed ξ 1h . We consider four types of cloud kinematics, including an isothermal model with a single velocity dispersion, a satellite infall model in which cool clouds reside in the subhaloes, a cloud accretion model in which clouds follow the cosmic gas accretion, and a tired wind model in which clouds originate from the galactic wind–driven bubbles. All the four models provide statistically good fits to the RSD data, but only the tired wind model can reproduce the observed truncation by propagating ancient wind bubbles at ∼250 km s−1 on scales ∼400 h−1kpc. Our method provides an exciting path to decoding the dynamical origin of metal absorbers from the RSD measurements with upcoming spectroscopic surveys.},

 abstract = {
 Pressure balance plays a central role in models of the interstellar medium (ISM), but whether and how pressure balance is realized in a realistic multiphase ISM is not yet well understood. We address this question by using a set of FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass disc galaxies, in which a multiphase ISM is self-consistently shaped by gravity, cooling, and stellar feedback. We analyse how gravity determines the vertical pressure profile as well as how the total ISM pressure is partitioned between different phases and components (thermal, dispersion/turbulence, and bulk flows). We show that, on average and consistent with previous more idealized simulations, the total ISM pressure balances the weight of the overlying gas. Deviations from vertical pressure balance increase with increasing galactocentric radius and with decreasing averaging scale. The different phases are in rough total pressure equilibrium with one another, but with large deviations from thermal pressure equilibrium owing to kinetic support in the cold and warm phases, which dominate the total pressure near the mid-plane. Bulk flows (e.g. inflows and fountains) are important at a few disc scale heights, while thermal pressure from hot gas dominates at larger heights. Overall, the total mid-plane pressure is well-predicted by the weight of the disc gas and we show that it also scales linearly with the star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR). These results support the notion that the Kennicutt–Schmidt relation arises because ΣSFR and the gas surface density (Σg) are connected via the ISM mid-plane pressure.},

We study these as implemented in the code gizmo for both new meshless finite-volume Godunov schemes (MFM/MFV). We show that the MFM/MFV methods are accurate and stable even with noisy fields and irregular particle arrangements, and recover the correct behaviour even in arbitrarily anisotropic cases. They are competitive with state-of-the-art AMR/moving-mesh methods, and can correctly treat anisotropic diffusion-driven instabilities (e.g. the MTI and HBI, Hall MRI). We also develop a new scheme for stabilizing anisotropic tensor-valued fluxes with high-order gradient estimators and non-linear flux limiters, which is trivially generalized to AMR/moving-mesh codes. We also present applications of some of these improvements for SPH, in the form of a new integral-Godunov SPH formulation that adopts a moving-least squares gradient estimator and introduces a flux-limited Riemann problem between particles.},

We release complete snapshots from three suites of simulations. The first comprises 20 simulations that zoom in on 14 Milky Way (MW)–mass galaxies, five SMC/LMC-mass galaxies, and four lower-mass galaxies including one ultrafaint; we release 39 snapshots across z = 0–10. The second comprises four massive galaxies, with 19 snapshots across z = 1–10. Finally, a high-redshift suite comprises 22 simulations, with 11 snapshots across z = 5–10. Each simulation also includes dozens of resolved lower-mass (satellite) galaxies in its zoom-in region. Snapshots include all stored properties for all dark matter, gas, and star particles, including 11 elemental abundances for stars and gas, and formation times (ages) of star particles. We also release accompanying (sub)halo catalogs, which include galaxy properties and member star particles. For the simulations to z = 0, including all MW-mass galaxies, we release the formation coordinates and an “ex situ” flag for all star particles, pointers to track particles across snapshots, catalogs of stellar streams, and multipole basis expansions for the halo mass distributions.

Using lines of sight targeted at impact parameters from 10 kpc to 1 Mpc around galaxies with halo masses from 10 11 10 13 M⊙, we study the physical conditions and their variation with impact pa- rameter b and line-of-sight velocityv in the CGM as traced by Hi, Mgii, Siiv, Civ, Ovi, and Neviii absorbers. All ions show a strong excess of absorption near galaxies compared to random lines of sight. The excess continues beyond 1 Mpc, re- flecting the correlation of metal absorption with large-scale structure. Absorption is particularly enhanced within aboutv < 300 kms −1 and roughly 300 kpc of galaxies (with distances somewhat larger for the highest ion), approximately delineating the CGM; this range contains the majority of global metal absorption. Low ions like Mgii and Siiv predominantly arise in denser gas closer to galaxies and drop more rapidly with b, while high ions Ovi and Neviii trace more diffusely distributed gas with a comparatively flat radial profile; Civ is intermediate. All ions predominantly trace T � 10 4−4.5 K photo-ionised gas at all b, but when hot CGM gas is present (mostly in larger halos), we see strong collisionally-ionised Ovi and Neviii at b 6 100 kpc. Larger halo masses generally produce more absorption, though overall the trends are not as strong as that with impact parameter. These findings arise using our favoured outflow scalings as expected for momentum-driven winds; with no winds, the CGM gas remains mostly unenriched, while our outflow model with a constant velocity and mass loading factor produce hotter, more widely dispersed metals.},

 abstract = {The hosts of luminous z ∼ 2 quasars evolve into today's massive elliptical galaxies. Current theories predict that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of these massive, dark matter halos (MDM ∼ 1012.5 M☉) should be dominated by a T ∼ 107 K virialized plasma. We test this hypothesis with observations of 74 close-projected quasar pairs, using spectra of the background QSO to characterize the CGM of the foreground one. Surprisingly, our measurements reveal a cool (T ≈ 104 K), massive (MCGM > 1010 M☉), and metal-enriched (Z ≳ 0.1 Z☉) medium extending to at least the expected virial radius (rvir = 160 kpc). The average equivalent widths of H i Lyα ( Å for impact parameters R⊥ < 200 kpc) and C ii 1334 () exceed the corresponding CGM measurements of these transitions from all galaxy populations studied previously. Furthermore, we conservatively estimate that the quasar CGM has a 64+6−7% covering fraction of optically thick gas (NH i > 1017.2 cm−2) within rvir; this covering factor is twice that of the contemporaneous Lyman break galaxy population. This unexpected reservoir of cool gas is rarely detected “down-the-barrel” to quasars, and hence it is likely that our background sight lines intercept gas that is shadowed from the quasar ionizing radiation by the same obscuring medium often invoked in models of active galactic nucleus unification. Because the high-z halos inhabited by quasars predate modern groups and clusters, these observations are also relevant to the formation and enrichment history of the intragroup/intracluster medium.},

 abstract = {The Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project explores feedback in cosmological galaxy formation simulations. Previous FIRE simulations used an identical source code (“FIRE-1”) for consistency. Motivated by the development of more accurate numerics – including hydrodynamic solvers, gravitational softening, and supernova coupling algorithms – and exploration of new physics (e.g. magnetic fields), we introduce “FIRE-2”, an updated numerical implementation of FIRE physics for the GIZMO code. We run a suite of simulations and compare against FIRE-1: overall, FIRE-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties. We pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics. Details of the star-formation algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects, provided that we include metal-line cooling and star formation occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are robust to numerics we test, provided: (1) Toomre masses are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. Stellar masses and profiles are most robust to resolution, followed by metal abundances and morphologies, followed by properties of winds and circum-galactic media (CGM). Central (∼kpc) mass concentrations in massive (>L*) galaxies are sensitive to numerics (via trapping/recycling of winds in hot halos). Multiple feedback mechanisms play key roles: supernovae regulate stellar masses/winds; stellar mass-loss fuels late star formation; radiative feedback suppresses accretion onto dwarfs and instantaneous star formation in disks. We provide all initial conditions and numerical algorithms used.},

The hot gas, traced by the X-ray absorption and emission, is in hydrostatic equilibrium in an MW gravitational potential. The median temperature of the hot gas is 1.5 × 10 6 K and the mean hydrogen density is ∼ 5 × 10 − 5 cm − 3 . The warm component as traced by the O vi, is gas that has cooled out of the high density tail of the hot component. The total warm/hot gas mass is high and is 1.2 × 10 11 M ⊙ .

 abstract = {We discuss cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation performed with the new moving-mesh code AREPO, which promises higher accuracy compared with the traditional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique that has been widely employed for this problem. In this exploratory study, we deliberately limit the complexity of the physical processes followed by the code for ease of comparison with previous calculations, and include only cooling of gas with a primordial composition, heating by a spatially uniform ultraviolet background, and a simple subresolution model for regulating star formation in the dense interstellar medium. We use an identical set of physics in corresponding simulations carried out with the well-tested SPH code GADGET, adopting also the same high-resolution gravity solver. We are thus able to compare both simulation sets on an object-by-object basis, allowing us to cleanly isolate the impact of different hydrodynamical methods on galaxy and halo properties. In accompanying papers, Vogelsberger et al. and Sijacki et al., we focus on an analysis of the global baryonic statistics predicted by the simulation codes, and complementary idealized simulations that highlight the differences between the hydrodynamical schemes. Here we investigate their influence on the baryonic properties of simulated galaxies and their surrounding haloes. We find that AREPO leads to significantly higher star formation rates for galaxies in massive haloes and to more extended gaseous discs in galaxies, which also feature a thinner and smoother morphology than their GADGET counterparts. Consequently, galaxies formed in AREPO have larger sizes and higher specific angular momentum than their SPH correspondents. Interestingly, the more efficient cooling flows in AREPO yield higher densities and lower entropies in halo centres compared to GADGET, whereas the opposite trend is found in halo outskirts. The cooling differences leading to higher star formation rates of massive galaxies in AREPO also slightly increase the baryon content within the virial radius of massive haloes. We show that these differences persist as a function of numerical resolution. While both codes agree to acceptable accuracy on a number of baryonic properties of cosmic structures, our results thus clearly demonstrate that galaxy formation simulations greatly benefit from the use of more accurate hydrodynamical techniques such as AREPO and call into question the reliability of galaxy formation studies in a cosmological context using traditional standard formulations of SPH, such as the one implemented in GADGET. Our new moving-mesh simulations demonstrate that a population of extended gaseous discs of galaxies in large volume cosmological simulations can be formed even without energetic feedback in the form of galactic winds, although such outflows appear required to obtain realistic stellar masses.},

 abstract = {We present a series of high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy formation to z = 0, spanning halo masses ∼10^8–10^(13) M⊙, and stellar masses ∼10^4–10^(11) M⊙. Our simulations include fully explicit treatment of the multiphase interstellar medium and stellar feedback. The stellar feedback inputs (energy, momentum, mass, and metal fluxes) are taken directly from stellar population models. These sources of feedback, with zero adjusted parameters, reproduce the observed relation between stellar and halo mass up to M_(halo) ∼ 10^(12) M⊙. We predict weak redshift evolution in the M*–M_(halo) relation, consistent with current constraints to z > 6. We find that the M*–M_(halo) relation is insensitive to numerical details, but is sensitive to feedback physics. Simulations with only supernova feedback fail to reproduce observed stellar masses, particularly in dwarf and high-redshift galaxies: radiative feedback (photoheating and radiation pressure) is necessary to destroy giant molecular clouds and enable efficient coupling of later supernovae to the gas. Star formation rates (SFRs) agree well with the observed Kennicutt relation at all redshifts. The galaxy-averaged Kennicutt relation is very different from the numerically imposed law for converting gas into stars, and is determined by self-regulation via stellar feedback. Feedback reduces SFRs and produces reservoirs of gas that lead to rising late-time star formation histories, significantly different from halo accretion histories. Feedback also produces large short-time-scale variability in galactic SFRs, especially in dwarfs. These properties are not captured by common ‘sub-grid’ wind models.},

 abstract = {We present measurements of the soft X-ray background (SXRB) O vii and O viii intensity between l = 120° and l = 240°, the first results of a survey of the SXRB using archival XMM-Newton observations. We do not restrict ourselves to blank-sky observations, but instead use as many observations as possible, removing bright or extended sources by hand if necessary. In an attempt to minimize contamination from near-Earth solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) emission, we remove times of high solar wind proton flux from the data. Without this filtering we are able to extract measurements from 586 XMM-Newton observations. With this filtering, ∼1/2 of the observations are rendered unusable, and we are able to extract measurements from 303 observations. The oxygen intensities are typically ∼0.5–10 photons cm−2 s−1 sr−1 (line units, L.U.) for O vii and ∼0–5 L.U. for O viii. The proton flux filtering does not systematically reduce the oxygen intensities measured from a given observation. However, the filtering does preferentially remove the observations with higher oxygen intensities. Our data set includes 69 directions with multiple observations, whose oxygen intensity variations can be used to constrain SWCX models. One observation exhibits an O vii enhancement of ∼25 L.U. over two other observations of the same direction, although most SWCX enhancements are ≲4 L.U. for O vii and ≲2 L.U. for O viii. We find no clear tendency for the O vii centroid to shift toward the forbidden line energy in observations with bright SWCX enhancements. There is also no universal association between enhanced SWCX emission and increased solar wind flux or the closeness of the sightline to the sub-solar region of the magnetosheath. After removing observations likely to be contaminated by heliospheric SWCX emission, we use our results to examine the Galactic halo. There is some scatter in the halo intensity about the predictions of a simple plane-parallel model, indicating a patchiness to the halo emission. The O vii/O viii intensity ratio implies a halo temperature of ∼2.0–2.5 × 106 K, in good agreement with previous studies.},

 abstract = {We report on the discovery of FRB 20200120E, a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) with a low dispersion measure (DM) detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment FRB project. The source DM of 87.82 pc cm−3 is the lowest recorded from an FRB to date, yet it is significantly higher than the maximum expected from the Milky Way interstellar medium in this direction (∼50 pc cm−3). We have detected three bursts and one candidate burst from the source over the period 2020 January–November. The baseband voltage data for the event on 2020 January 20 enabled a sky localization of the source to within ≃14 arcmin2 (90% confidence). The FRB localization is close to M81, a spiral galaxy at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. The FRB appears on the outskirts of M81 (projected offset ∼20 kpc) but well inside its extended H i and thick disks. We empirically estimate the probability of a chance coincidence with M81 to be <10−2. However, we cannot reject a Milky Way halo origin for the FRB. Within the FRB localization region, we find several interesting cataloged M81 sources and a radio point source detected in the Very Large Array Sky Survey. We search for prompt X-ray counterparts in Swift Burst Alert Telescope and Fermi/GBM data, and, for two of the FRB 20200120E bursts, we rule out coincident SGR 1806−20-like X-ray bursts. Due to the proximity of FRB 20200120E, future follow-up for prompt multiwavelength counterparts and subarcsecond localization could be constraining of proposed FRB models.},

 abstract = {We introduce the Simba simulations, the next generation of the Mufasa cosmological galaxy formation simulations run with Gizmo's meshless finite mass hydrodynamics. Simba includes updates to Mufasa's sub-resolution star formation and feedback prescriptions, and introduces black hole growth via the torque-limited accretion model of Angles-Alcazar et al. (2017) from cold gas and Bondi accretion from hot gas, along with black hole feedback via kinetic bipolar outflows and X-ray energy. Ejection velocities are taken to be ~10^3 km/s at high Eddington ratios, increasing to ~8000 km/s at Eddington ratios below 2%, with a constant momentum input of 20L/c. Simba further includes an on-the-fly dust production, growth, and destruction model. Our Simba run with (100 Mpc/h)^3 and 1024^3 gas elements reproduces numerous observables, including galaxy stellar mass functions at z=0-6, the stellar mass--star formation rate main sequence, HI and H2 fractions, the mass-metallicity relation at z=0 and z=2, star-forming galaxy sizes, hot gas fractions in massive halos, and z=0 galaxy dust properties. However, Simba also yields an insufficiently sharp truncation of the z=0 mass function, and too-large sizes for low-mass quenched galaxies. We show that Simba's jet feedback is primarily responsible for quenching massive galaxies.},

The origin of the absorbing gas, however, is not well understood. We demonstrate that an extremely large star formation rate is required if the HEAL gas originates from galactic disks. This is clearly incompatible with the observed moderate evolution and the normal colors of the galaxies associated with the Mg II absorption lines (MgALs). Studies of the H I high-velocity clouds, the Magellanic Stream, and recent observations of nearby QSOs suggest that the gas tidally torn out from the LMC/SMC system may be responsible for the MgALs observed in the Galactic halo},

 abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the ‘tree’ method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10 10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10 5 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.

 abstract = {We study the formation of galaxies in a large volume (50 h −1 Mpc, 2 × 288 3 particles) cosmological simulation, evolved using the entropy and energy-conserving smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-2. Most of the baryonic mass in galaxies of all masses is originally acquired through filamentary ‘cold mode’ accretion of gas that was never shock heated to its halo virial temperature, confirming the key feature of our earlier results obtained with a different SPH code. Atmospheres of hot, virialized gas develop in haloes above 2–3 × 10 11 M � , a transition mass that is nearly constant from z = 3 to 0. Cold accretion persists in haloes above the transition mass, especially at z ≥ 2. It dominates the growth of galaxies in low-mass haloes at all times, and it is the main driver of the cosmic star formation history. Our results suggest that the cooling of shock-heated virialized gas, which has been the focus of many analytic models of galaxy growth spanning more than three decades, might be a relatively minor element of galaxy formation. At high redshifts, satellite galaxies have gas accretion rates similar to central galaxies of the same baryonic mass, but at z < 1t he accretion rates of low-mass satellites are well below those of comparable central galaxies. Relative to our earlier simulations, the GADGET-2 simulations predict much lower rates of ‘hot mode’ accretion from the virialized gas component. Hot accretion rates compete with cold accretion rates near the transition mass, but only at z ≤ 1. Hot accretion is inefficient in haloes},

We show that equivalent width (EW) is anti-correlated with impact parameter and O vi covering fraction decreases from 80% within 50 kpc to 33% at 200 kpc. The presence of O vi absorption is azimuthally dependent and occurs between ±10°–20° of the galaxy projected major axis and within ±30° of the projected minor axis. We find higher EWs along the projected minor axis with weaker EWs along the project major axis. Highly inclined galaxies have the lowest covering fractions due to minimized outflow/inflow cross-section geometry. Absorbing galaxies also have bluer colors while non-absorbers have redder colors, suggesting that star formation is a key driver in the O vi detection rate. O vi surrounding blue galaxies exists primarily along the projected minor axis with wide opening angles while O vi surrounding red galaxies exists primarily along the projected major axis with smaller opening angles, which may explain why absorption around red galaxies is less frequently detected. Our results are consistent with a circumgalactic medium (CGM) originating from major axis-fed inflows/recycled gas and from minor axis-driven outflows. Non-detected O vi occurs between Φ = 20°–60°, suggesting that O vi is not mixed throughout the CGM and remains confined within the outflows and the disk-plane. We find low O vi covering fractions within ± 10 ° ?> of the projected major axis, suggesting that cool dense gas resides in a narrow planer geometry surrounded by diffuse O vi gas.},

The combined $HST$ and $Keck$ spectra cover UV, redshifted EUV, and optical transitions from a multitude of ions spanning ionization energies in the range of $\sim (13 - 300)$ eV. Low ionization (C II, O II, Si II, Mg II) and very high ionization species (Ne VIII, Mg X) are non-detections in all the absorbers. Three of the absorbers have coverage of He I, in one of which it is a $> 3 \sigma$ detection. The kinematic structures of these absorbers are extracted from C IV detected in $HIRES$ spectra. The farthest absorber in our sample also contains the detections of Ne V and Ne VI. Assuming co-spatial absorbing components, the ionization models show the medium to be multiphased with small-scale density-temperature inhomogeneities that are sometimes kinematically unresolved. In two of the absorbers, there is an explicit indication of the presence of a warm gas phase ($T \gtrsim 10^5$ K) traced by O VI. In the remaining absorbers, the column densities of the ions are consistent with a non-uniform photoionized medium. The sub-solar [C/O] relative abundances inferred for the absorbers point at enrichment from massive Type II supernovae. Despite metal enrichment, the inferred wide range for [O/H] $\sim$ [$-2.1, +0.2$] amongst the absorbers along with their anti-correlation with the observed H I suggest poor small-scale mixing of metals with hydrogen in the regions surrounding galaxies and the IGM.},

 abstract = {We summarize and reanalyze observations bearing on missing galactic baryons, where we propose a consistent picture for halo gas in L ≳ L* galaxies. The hot X-ray-emitting halos are detected to 50–70 kpc, where typically Mhot(<50 kpc) ∼ 5 × 109 M⊙, and with density n ∝ r−3/2. When extrapolated to R200, the gas mass is comparable to the stellar mass, but about half of the baryons are still missing from the hot phase. If extrapolated to 1.7R200–3R200, the ratio of baryon to dark matter approaches the cosmic value. Significantly flatter density profiles are unlikely for R < 50 kpc, and they are disfavored but not ruled out for R > 50 kpc. For the Milky Way, the hot halo metallicity lies in the range 0.3–1 solar for R < 50 kpc. Planck measurements of the thermal Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (SZ) effect toward stacked luminous galaxies (primarily early type) indicate that most of their baryons are hot, are near the virial temperature, and extend beyond R200. This stacked SZ signal is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that inferred from the X-ray observations of individual (mostly spiral) galaxies with M* > 1011.3 M⊙. This difference suggests that the hot halo properties are distinct for early- and late-type galaxies, possibly due to different evolutionary histories. For the cooler gas detected in UV absorption line studies, we argue that there are two absorption populations: extended halos, and disks extending to ∼50 kpc, containing most of this gas, and with masses a few times lower than the stellar masses. Such extended disks are also seen in 21 cm H i observations and in simulations.},

 abstract = {The cosmic star formation rate is observed to drop sharply after redshift z=2. We use a large, cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation to investigate how this decline is related to the evolution of gas accretion and to outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the drop in the star formation rate follows a corresponding decline in the global cold-mode accretion rate density onto haloes, but with a delay of order the gas consumption time scale in the interstellar medium. Here we define cold-mode (hot-mode) accretion as gas that is accreted and whose temperature has never exceeded (did exceed) 10^5.5 K. In contrast to cold-mode accretion, which peaks at z~3, the hot mode continues to increase to z~1 and remains roughly constant thereafter. By the present time, the hot mode strongly dominates the global accretion rate onto haloes. Star formation does not track hot-mode halo accretion because most of the hot halo gas never accretes onto galaxies. AGN feedback plays a crucial role by preferentially preventing gas that entered haloes in the hot mode from accreting onto their central galaxies. Consequently, in the absence of AGN feedback, gas accreted in the hot mode would become the dominant source of fuel for star formation and the drop off in the cosmic star formation rate would be much less steep.},

 abstract = {We use hydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project to explore the morphologies and kinematics of 15 Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. Our sample ranges from compact, bulge-dominated systems with 90 per cent of their stellar mass within 2.5 kpc to well-ordered discs that reach ≳15 kpc. The gas in our galaxies always forms a thin, rotation-supported disc at z = 0, with sizes primarily determined by the gas mass. For stars, we quantify kinematics and morphology both via the fraction of stars on disc-like orbits and with the radial extent of the stellar disc. In this mass range, stellar morphology and kinematics are poorly correlated with the properties of the halo available from dark matter-only simulations (halo merger history, spin, or formation time). They more strongly correlate with the gaseous histories of the galaxies: those that maintain a high gas mass in the disc after z ~ 1 develop well-ordered stellar discs. The best predictor of morphology we identify is the spin of the gas in the halo at the time the galaxy formed 1/2 of its stars (i.e. the gas that builds the galaxy). High-z mergers, before a hot halo emerges, produce some of the most massive bulges in the sample (from compact discs in gas-rich mergers), while later-forming bulges typically originate from internal processes, as satellites are stripped of gas before the galaxies merge. Moreover, most stars in z = 0 MW-mass galaxies (even z = 0 bulge stars) form in a disc: ≳60-90 per cent of stars begin their lives rotationally supported.},

 abstract = {We present a robust method to constrain average galaxy star formation rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), and the intracluster light (ICL) as a function of halo mass. Our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates (SSFRs), and cosmic star formation rates (CSFRs) from z = 0 to z = 8. We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, SFRs, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo–subhalo merger rates out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 1012 M☉ are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z ∼ 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z ∼ 1–1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in ΛCDM. Constraints on the stellar mass–halo mass relationship and SFRs are available for download online.},

Using a combination of quasar spectra from Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/COS and from Keck/HIRES or Very Large Telescope/UVES, we measure column densities of, or determine limits on, CGM absorption lines. We then use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach with Cloudy to estimate the metallicity of cool (T ∼ 104 K) CGM gas. We also use HST images to determine host-galaxy inclination and quasar-galaxy azimuthal angles. Our sample spans a H i column density range of 13.8 cm−2 < < 19.9 cm−2. We find (1) while the metallicity distribution appears bimodal, a Hartigan dip test cannot rule out a unimodal distribution (0.4σ). (2) CGM metallicities are independent of halo mass, spanning three orders of magnitude at a fixed halo mass. (3) The CGM metallicity does not depend on the galaxy azimuthal and inclination angles regardless of H i column density, impact parameter, and galaxy color. (4) The ionization parameter does not depend on azimuthal angle. We suggest that the partial Lyman limit metallicity bimodality is not driven by a spatial azimuthal bimodality. Our results are consistent with simulations where the CGM is complex and outflowing, accreting, and recycled gas are well-homogenized at z < 0.7. The presence of low-metallicity gas at all orientations suggests that cold streams of accreting filaments are not necessarily aligned with the galaxy plane at low redshifts or intergalactic transfer may dominate. Finally, our results support simulations showing that strong metal absorption can mask the presence of low-metallicity gas in integrated line-of-sight CGM metallicities.},

 abstract = {We investigate stellar metallicity distribution functions (MDFs), including Fe and α-element abundances, in dwarf galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environment (FIRE) project. We examine both isolated dwarf galaxies and those that are satellites of a Milky Way-mass galaxy. In particular, we study the effects of including a sub-grid turbulent model for the diffusion of metals in gas. Simulations that include diffusion have narrower MDFs and abundance ratio distributions, because diffusion drives individual gas and star particles towards the average metallicity. This effect provides significantly better agreement with observed abundance distributions in dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, including small intrinsic scatter in [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] of ≲0.1 dex. This small intrinsic scatter arises in our simulations because the interstellar medium in dwarf galaxies is well mixed at nearly all cosmic times, such that stars that form at a given time have similar abundances to ≲0.1 dex. Thus, most of the scatter in abundances at z = 0 arises from redshift evolution and not from instantaneous scatter in the ISM. We find similar MDF widths and intrinsic scatter for satellite and isolated dwarf galaxies, which suggests that environmental effects play a minor role compared with internal chemical evolution in our simulations. Overall, with the inclusion of metal diffusion, our simulations reproduce abundance distribution widths of observed low-mass galaxies, enabling detailed studies of chemical evolution in galaxy formation.},

 abstract = {We examine the growth of the stellar content of galaxies from z = 3 → 0 in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations incorporating parametrized galactic outflows. Without outflows, galaxies overproduce stellar masses (M * ) and star formation rates (SFRs) compared to observations. Winds introduce a three-tier form for the galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate functions, where the middle tier depends on the differential (i.e. mass-dependent) recycling of ejected wind material back into galaxies. A tight M * ―SFR relation is a generic outcome of all these simulations and its evolution is well described as being powered by cold accretion, although current observations at z ≳ 2 suggest that the star formation in small early galaxies must be highly suppressed. Roughly, one-third of z = 0 galaxies at masses below M * are satellites and the star formation in satellites is not much burstier than in centrals. All models fail to suppress the star formation and stellar mass growth in massive galaxies at z ≲ 2, indicating the need for an external quenching mechanism such as black hole feedback. All models also fail to produce dwarfs as young and rapidly star forming as observed. An outflow model following scalings expected for momentum-driven winds broadly matches the observed galaxy evolution around M * from z = 0 to 3, which is a significant success since these galaxies dominate cosmic star formation, but the failures at higher and lower masses highlight the challenges still faced by this class of models. We argue that central star-forming galaxies are well described as living in a slowly evolving equilibrium between inflows from gravity and recycled winds, star formation, and strong and ubiquitous outflows that regulate how much inflow forms into stars. Star-forming galaxy evolution is thus primarily governed by the continual cycling of baryons between galaxies and intergalactic gas.},

We employ the pixel optical depth method and uncover strong correlations between various combinations of HI, CIII, CIV, Si III, Si IV, and OVI.We find good agreement between many of the simulated and observed correlations, including τOVI(τHI). However, the observed median optical depths for the τCIV(τHI) and τSi IV(τHI) relations are higher than those measured from the mock spectra. The discrepancy increases from up to ≈0.1 dex at τHI = 1 to ≈1 dex at τHI = 102, where we are likely probing dense regions at small galactocentric distances. As possible solutions, we invoke (a) models of ionizing radiation softened above 4 Ryd to account for delayed completion of He II reionization; (b) simulations run at higher resolution; (c) the inclusion of additional line broadening due to unresolved turbulence; and (d) increased elemental abundances; however, none of these factors can fully explain the observed differences. 
Enhanced photoionization of HI by local sources, which was not modelled, could offer a solution. However, the much better agreement with the observed OVI(H I) relation, which we find probes a hot and likely collisionally ionized gas phase, indicates that the simulations are not in tension with the hot phase of the IGM, and suggests that the simulated outflows may entrain insufficient cool gas.},

We model a multiphase interstellar medium including stellar feedback by supernovae, stellar winds, and radiation, and a hyper-Lagrangian refinement technique increasing the resolution dynamically approaching the black hole. We do not include black hole feedback. We show that the subpc inflow rate (1) can reach ∼6 M ⊙ yr−1 roughly in steady state during the epoch of peak nuclear gas density (z ∼ 2), sufficient to power a luminous quasar, (2) is highly time variable in the pre-quasar phase, spanning 0.001–10 M ⊙ yr−1 on Myr timescales, and (3) is limited to short (∼2 Myr) active phases (0.01–0.1 M ⊙ yr−1) followed by longer periods of inactivity at lower nuclear gas density and late times (z ∼ 1), owing to the formation of a hot central cavity. Inflowing gas is primarily cool, rotational support dominates over turbulence and thermal pressure, and star formation can consume as much gas as provided by inflows across 1 pc–10 kpc. Gravitational torques from multiscale stellar non-axisymmetries dominate angular momentum transport over gas self-torquing and pressure gradients, with accretion weakly dependent on black hole mass. Subpc inflow rates correlate with nuclear (but decouple from global) star formation and can exceed the Eddington rate by ×10. The black hole can move ∼10 pc from the galaxy center on ∼0.1 Myr. Accreting gas forms pc-scale, rotationally supported, obscuring structures often misaligned with the galaxy-scale disk. These simulations open a new avenue to investigate black hole–galaxy coevolution.},

 abstract = {Galaxy evolution is thought to be driven in large part by the flow of gas between galaxies and the circumgalactic medium (CGM), a halo of metal-enriched gas extending out to ≳100 kpc from each galaxy. Studying the spatial structure of the CGM holds promise for understanding these gas flow mechanisms; however, the common method of using background quasar sight lines provides minimal spatial information. Recent works have shown the utility of extended background sources such as giant gravitationally lensed arcs. Using background lensed arcs from the CSWA 38 lens system, we continuously probed, at a resolution element of about 15 kpc2, the spatial and kinematic distribution of Mg ii absorption in a star-forming galaxy at z = 0.77 (stellar mass ≈109.7 M ⊙, star formation rate ≈10 M ⊙ yr−1) at impact parameters D ≃ 5–30 kpc. Our results present an anisotropic, optically thick medium whose absorption strength decreases with increasing impact parameter, in agreement with the statistics toward quasars and other gravitational arcs. Furthermore, we find generally low line-of-sight velocities in comparison to the relatively high velocity dispersion in the Mg ii gas (with typical σ ≈ 50 km s−1). While the galaxy itself exhibits a clear outflow (with Mg ii velocities up to ∼500 km s−1) in the down-the-barrel spectrum, the outflow component is subdominant and only weakly detected at larger impact parameters probed by the background arcs. Our results provide evidence of mainly dispersion-supported, metal-enriched gas recycling through the CGM.},

Combining the power of a high-resolution VLT/UVES quasar spectrum, a Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys image, and integral field spectroscopy with Keck/KCWI (Keck Cosmic Web Imager), we detected Lyα emission from a 1.7L* galaxy at zgal = 2.0711 associated with a Lyman limit system with weak Mg ii (Wr(2796) = 0.24 Å) in quasar field J143040+014939. The galaxy is star-forming (SFRFUV = 37.8 M⊙ yr−1) and clumpy: either an edge-on disk (i = 85°) or, less likely, a major merger. The background quasar probes the galaxy at an impact parameter of D = 66 kpc along the projected galaxy minor axis (Φ = 89°). From photoionization modeling of the absorption system, we infer a total line-of-sight CGM metallicity of . The absorption system is roughly kinematically symmetric about zgal, with a full Mg ii velocity spread of ∼210 km s−1. Given the galaxy–quasar orientation, CGM metallicity, and gas kinematics, we interpret this gas as an outflow that has likely swept up additional material. By modeling the absorption as a polar outflow cone, we find the gas is decelerating with average radial velocity Vout = 109–588 km s−1 for half-opening angles of θ0 = 14°–75°. Assuming a constant Vout, it would take on average tout ∼ 111–597 Myr for the gas to reach 66 kpc. The outflow is energetic, with a mass outflow rate of M⊙ yr−1 and mass loading factor of η < 1.4 ± 1.0. We aim to build a sample of ∼50 Mg ii absorber–galaxy pairs at this epoch to better understand gas flows when they are most actively building galaxies.},

 abstract = {Measurements of interstellar Na I λλ5890, 5896 absorption lines in 18 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs) have been combined with published Na I data, to reassess the dependence of galactic outflow speeds on starburst luminosity and galactic mass. The Doppler shifts reveal outflows of relatively cool gas in 15 of 18 ULIGs with an average outflow speed at the line center of 330 ± 100 km s-1. The relation between outflow speed and star formation rate (SFR), defined by the distribution's upper envelope over 4 orders of magnitude in SFR, demonstrates that winds from more luminous starbursts accelerate interstellar gas to higher speeds roughly as v ∝ SFR0.35. This result is surprising since, in the traditional model for starburst-driven winds, these relatively cool gas clouds are accelerated by the ram pressure of a hot, supernova-heated wind that exhibits weak (if any) X-ray temperature variation with increasing galactic mass. The lack of evidence for much hotter winds is partly a sensitivity issue, but the Na I velocities in ultraluminous starbursts actually are consistent with acceleration by the tepid wind, indicating that a hotter component is unlikely to dominate the momentum flux. The Na I velocities in the dwarf starburst winds do not reach the terminal velocity of a hot wind at the measured temperature of kT ~ 0.73 keV, a result that could be interpreted simply as evidence that the hot superbubbles are too confined in dwarf starbursts to generate a free-flowing wind. A dynamically motivated scenario, however, is that the dwarf starburst winds simply lack enough momentum to accelerate the clouds to the velocity of the hot wind. Among the subsample of starbursts with well-constrained dynamical masses, the terminal outflow velocities are always found to approach the galactic escape velocity. Motivated by a similar scaling relation for stellar winds, the galactic Eddington luminosity for dusty starbursts is shown to be within the range measured for ULIGs. If radiation pressure on dust grains, coupled to the cool wind, is indeed important for galactic wind dynamics, then feedback is stronger in massive galaxies than previously thought, helping shape the high-mass end of the galaxy luminosity function. Regardless of the nature of the acceleration mechanism in ULIGs, the mass flux of cool gas estimated from these data demonstrates that starburst-driven winds transport significant gas during the assembly stage of field elliptical galaxies, a factor that helps explain the rapid decline in SFR in these systems inferred from elemental abundance ratios.},

By jellyfish galaxies, we mean satellites orbiting in massive groups and clusters that exhibit highly asymmetric distributions of gas and gas tails. We use the TNG100 run and select galaxies at redshifts $z\le0.6$ with stellar mass exceeding $10^{9.5}{\rm M_\odot}$ and with host halo masses of $10^{13}-10^{14.6}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. Among more than about 6000 (2600) galaxies with stars (and some gas), we identify 800 jellyfish galaxies by visually inspecting their gas and stellar mass maps in random projections. About $31\%$ of cluster satellites are found with signatures of ram-pressure stripping and gaseous tails stemming from the main luminous bodies. This is a lower limit, since the random orientation entails a loss of about $30\%$ of galaxies that in an optimal projection would otherwise be identified as jellyfish. The connection with ram-pressure stripping is further confirmed by a series of findings: jellyfish galaxies are more frequent at intermediate and large cluster-centric distances ($r/R_{\rm 200c}\gtrsim 0.25$); they move through the ICM with larger bulk velocities and Mach numbers than the general cluster population, typically orbiting supersonically and experiencing larger ram pressures. Furthermore, the gaseous tails usually extend in opposite directions to the galaxy trajectory, with no relation between tail orientation and the host's center. The frequency of jellyfish galaxies shows a very weak dependence on redshift $(0\le z\le0.6)$ but larger fractions of disturbed gaseous morphologies occur in more massive hosts and at smaller satellite masses. Finally, jellyfish galaxies are late infallers ($< 2.5-3$ Gyrs ago, at $z=0$) and the emergence of gaseous tails correlates well with the presence of bow shocks in the ICM.},

 abstract = {We examine the origin and evolution of the mass-metallicity relationship (MZR, M*-Z) for galaxies using high-resolution cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) + N-body simulations that include a physically motivated description of supernova feedback and subsequent metal enrichment. We discriminate between two sources that may contribute to the origin of the MZR: (1) metal and baryon loss due to gas outflow or (2) inefficient star formation at the lowest galaxy masses. Our simulated galaxies reproduce the observed MZR in shape and normalization at both z = 0 and 2. We find that baryon loss occurs due to UV heating before star formation turns on in galaxies with Mbar < 108 M☉, but that some gas loss due to supernova-induced winds is required to subsequently reproduce the low effective chemical yield observed in low-mass galaxies. Despite this, we show that low star formation efficiencies, regulated by supernova feedback, are primarily responsible for the lower metallicities of low-mass galaxies and the overall M*-Z trend. We find that the shape of the MZR is relatively constant with redshift but that its normalization increases with time. Simulations with no energy feedback from supernovae overproduce metals at low galaxy masses by rapidly transforming a large fraction of their gas into stars. Despite the fact that our low-mass galaxies have lost a majority of their baryons, they are still the most gas-rich objects in our simulations due to their low star formation efficiencies.},

 abstract = {A study of metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) using a series of smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations is presented, employing models for metal cooling and the turbulent diffusion of metals and thermal energy. An adiabatic feedback mechanism was adopted where gas cooling was prevented on the timescale of supernova bubble expansion to generate galactic winds without explicit wind particles. The simulations produced a cosmic star formation history (SFH) that is broadly consistent with observations until z � 0.5, and a steady evolution of the universal neutral hydrogen fraction (HI) that compares reasonably well with observations. The evolution of the mass and metallicities in stars and various gas phases was investigated. At z=0, about 40% of the baryons are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), but most metals (80%-90%) are locked in stars. At higher redshifts the proportion of metals in the IGM is higher due to more efficient loss from galaxies. The r also indicate that IGM metals primarily reside in the WHIM throughout cosmic history, which differs from simulations with hydrodynamically decoupled explicit winds. The metallicity of the WHIM lies between 0.01 and 0.1 solar with a slight decrease at lower redshifts. The metallicity evolution of the gas inside galaxies are broadly consistent with observations, but the diffuse IGM is under enriched at z � 2.5. Galactic winds most efficiently enrich the IGM for halos in the intermediate mass range 10 10 M � - 10 11 M � . At the low mass end gas is prevented from accreting onto halos and has very low metallicities. At the high mass end, the fraction of halo baryons escaped as winds declines along with the decline of stellar mass fraction of the galaxies. This is likely because of the decrease in star formation activity and decrease in wind escape efficiency. Metals enhance cooling which allows WHIM gas to cool onto galaxies and increases star formation. Metal diffusion allows winds to mix prior to escape, decreasing the IGM metal content in favour of gas within galactic halos and star forming gas. Diffusion significantly increases the amount of gas with low metallicities and changes the density-metallicity relation.},

Density maps of old, metal-poor RGB stars reveal tidal streams extending on two sides of DDO 44, with the streams directed toward NGC 2403. We estimate total luminosities of the original DDO 44 system (dwarf and streams combined) to be Mi,tot = −13.4 and Mg,tot = −12.6, with ∼25%–30% of the luminosity in the streams. Analogs of ∼LMC-mass hosts with massive tidally disrupting satellites are rare in the Illustris simulations, especially at large separations such as that of DDO 44.

The survey used FLAMES on the ESO Very Large Telescope. SHαDE is designed to study the kinematics and stellar populations of dwarf galaxies using consistent methods applied to massive galaxies and at matching level of detail, connecting these mass ranges in an unbiased way. In this paper, we set out the science goals of SHαDE, describe the sample properties, outline the data reduction, and analysis processes. We investigate the log M⋆–log S0.5 mass–kinematics scaling relation, which has previously shown potential for combining galaxies of all morphologies in a single scaling relation. We extend the scaling relation from massive galaxies to dwarf galaxies, demonstrating this relation is linear down to a stellar mass of M⋆ ∼ 108.6 M⊙. Below this limit, the kinematics of galaxies inside one effective radius appears to be dominated by the internal velocity dispersion limit of the H α-emitting gas, giving a bend in the log M⋆–log S0.5 relation. Replacing stellar mass with total baryonic mass using gas mass estimate reduces the severity but does not remove the linearity limit of the scaling relation. An extrapolation to estimate the galaxies’ dark matter halo masses, yields a log Mh–log S0.5 scaling relation that is free of any bend, has reduced curvature over the whole mass range, and brings galaxies of all masses and morphologies on to the virial relation.},

 abstract = {
 Observations of ultraviolet (UV) metal absorption lines have provided insight into the structure and composition of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxies. We compare these observations with the low-redshift (z ≤ 0.3) CGM around dwarf galaxies in high-resolution cosmological zoom-in runs in the FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) simulation suite. We select simulated galaxies that match the halo mass, stellar mass, and redshift of the observed samples. We produce absorption measurements using trident for UV transitions of C iv, O vi, Mg ii, and Si iii. The FIRE equivalent width (EW) distributions and covering fractions for the C iv ion are broadly consistent with observations inside 0.5Rvir, but are underpredicted for O vi, Mg ii, and Si iii. The absorption strengths of the ions in the CGM are moderately correlated with the masses and star formation activity of the galaxies. The correlation strengths increase with the ionization potential of the ions. The structure and composition of the gas from the simulations exhibit three zones around dwarf galaxies characterized by distinct ion column densities: the discy interstellar medium, the inner CGM (the wind-dominated regime), and the outer CGM (the IGM accretion-dominated regime). We find that the outer CGM in the simulations is nearly but not quite supported by thermal pressure, so it is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, resulting in halo-scale bulk inflow and outflow motions. The net gas inflow rates are comparable to the star formation rate of the galaxy, but the bulk inflow and outflow rates are greater by an order of magnitude, with velocities comparable to the virial velocity of the halo. These roughly virial velocities (${\sim } 100 \, \rm km\, s^{-1}$) produce large EWs in the simulations. This supports a picture for dwarf galaxies in which the dynamics of the CGM at large scales are coupled to the small-scale star formation activity near the centre of their haloes.},

 abstract = {We present an implementation of stellar evolution and chemical feedback for smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. We consider the timed release of individual elements by both massive (Type II supernovae and stellar winds) and intermediate-mass stars (Type Ia supernovae and asymptotic giant branch stars). We illustrate the results of our method using a suite of cosmological simulations that include new prescriptions for radiative cooling, star formation and galactic winds. Radiative cooling is implemented element-by-element, in the presence of an ionizing radiation background, and we track all 11 elements that contribute significantly to the radiative cooling. 
 
 
 
While all simulations presented here use a single set of physical parameters, we take specific care to investigate the robustness of the predictions of chemodynamical simulations with respect to the ingredients, the methods and the numerical convergence. A comparison of nucleosynthetic yields taken from the literature indicates that relative abundance ratios may only be reliable at the factor of 2 level, even for a fixed initial mass function. Abundances relative to iron are even more uncertain because the rate of Type Ia supernovae is not well known. We contrast two reasonable definitions of the metallicity of a resolution element and find that while they agree for high metallicities, there are large differences at low metallicities. We argue that the discrepancy is indicative of the lack of metal mixing caused by the fact that metals are stuck to particles. We argue that since this is a (numerical) sampling problem, solving it by using a poorly constrained physical process such as diffusion could have undesired consequences. We demonstrate that the two metallicity definitions result in redshift z= 0 stellar masses that can differ by up to a factor of 2, because of the sensitivity of the cooling rates to the elemental abundances. 
 
 
 
Finally, we use several 5123 particle simulations to investigate the evolution of the distribution of heavy elements, which we find to be in reasonably good agreement with available observational constraints. We find that by z= 0 most of the metals are locked up in stars. The gaseous metals are distributed over a very wide range of gas densities and temperatures. The shock-heated warm–hot intergalactic medium has a relatively high metallicity of ∼10−1 Z⊙ that evolves only weakly, and is therefore an important reservoir of metals. Any census aiming to account for most of the metal mass will have to take a wide variety of objects and structures into account.},

These observations were chosen from a much larger set of observations as they are expected to be the least contaminated by solar wind charge exchange emission. We characterize the halo emission in the XMM-Newton band with a single-temperature plasma model. We find that the observed halo temperature is fairly constant across the sky (∼(1.8–2.4) × 106 K), whereas the halo emission measure varies by an order of magnitude (∼0.0005–0.006 cm−6 pc). When we compare our observations with the model predictions, we find that most of the hot gas observed with XMM-Newton does not reside in isolated extraplanar supernova (SN) remnants—this model predicts emission an order of magnitude too faint. A model of an SN-driven interstellar medium, including the flow of hot gas from the disk into the halo in a galactic fountain, gives good agreement with the observed 0.4–2.0 keV surface brightness. This model overpredicts the halo X-ray temperature by a factor of ∼2, but there are a several possible explanations for this discrepancy. We therefore conclude that a major (possibly dominant) contributor to the halo X-ray emission observed with XMM-Newton is a fountain of hot gas driven into the halo by disk SNe. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the extended hot halo of accreted material predicted by disk galaxy formation models also contributes to the emission.},

This survey has yielded 39 spectra of zem ≃ 0.5 QSOs with S/N ∼10–15 per resolution element. The QSO sightlines pass within 150 physical kpc of the galaxies, which span early and late types over stellar mass log M*/M☉ = 9.5–11.5. We find that the circumgalactic medium exhibits strong H i, averaging ≃ 1 Å in Lyα equivalent width out to 150 kpc, with 100% covering fraction for star-forming galaxies and 75% covering for passive galaxies. We find good agreement in column densities between this survey and previous studies over similar range of impact parameter. There is weak evidence for a difference between early- and late-type galaxies in the strength and distribution of H i. Kinematics indicate that the detected material is bound to the host galaxy, such that ≳ 90% of the detected column density is confined within ±200 km s−1 of the galaxies. This material generally exists well below the halo virial temperatures at T ≲ 105 K. We evaluate a number of possible origin scenarios for the detected material, and in the end favor a simple model in which the bulk of the detected H i arises in a bound, cool, low-density photoionized diffuse medium that is generic to all L* galaxies and may harbor a total gaseous mass comparable to galactic stellar masses.},

The new method combines the information available from different sightlines during the photoionization modeling, thus yielding tighter constraints on CGM properties compared to traditional methods that model each sightline individually. Applying this new technique to the COS Halos survey of low-redshift ∼L* galaxies, we find that we can reproduce all observed ion columns in all 44 galaxies in the sample, from the low ions to , with a single universal density structure for the cool CGM. The gas densities span the range ( is the cosmic mean), while the physical size of individual clouds scales as ∼ρ−1, from ≈35 kpc for the low-density clouds to ≈6 pc for the highest-density low-ion clouds. The deduced cloud sizes are too small for this density structure to be driven by self-gravity; thus, its physical origin is unclear. The implied cool CGM mass within the virial radius is (1.3 ± 0.4) × 1010 (∼1% of the halo mass), distributed rather uniformly over the 4 decades in density. The mean cool gas density profile scales as , where R is the distance from the galaxy center. We construct a 3D model of the cool CGM based on our results, which we argue provides a benchmark for the CGM structure in hydrodynamic simulations.

We find for a monatomic gas that the shock is stable when the post-shock pressure and density obey γ e f f ≡ (d In P/dt)/(d In p/dt) > 10/7. When expressed in terms of the pre-shock gas properties at radius r it reads as ρrΛ(T)/u 3 < 0.0126, where p is the gas density, u is the infall velocity and A(T) is the cooling function, with the post-shock temperature T u 2 . This result is confirmed by hydrodynamical simulations, using an accurate spheri-symmetric Lagrangian code. When the stability analysis is applied in cosmology, we find that a virial shock does not develop in most haloes that form before z ∼ 2, and it never forms in haloes less massive than a few 10 1 1 M O .. In such haloes, the infalling gas is not heated to the virial temperature until it hits the disc, thus avoiding the cooling-dominated quasi-static contraction phase. The direct collapse of the cold gas into the disc should have non-trivial effects on the star formation rate and on outflows. The soft X-ray produced by the shock-heated gas in the disc is expected to ionize the dense disc environment, and the subsequent recombination would result in a high flux of La emission. This may explain both the puzzling low flux of soft X-ray background and the La emitters observed at high redshift.},

 abstract = {The bimodal absorption system imaging campaign (BASIC) aims to characterize the galaxy environments of a sample of 36 H i-selected partial Lyman limit systems (pLLSs) and Lyman limit systems (LLSs) in 23 QSO fields at z ≲ 1. These pLLSs/LLSs provide a unique sample of absorbers with unbiased and well-constrained metallicities, allowing us to explore the origins of metal-rich and low-metallicity circumgalactic medium (CGM) at z < 1. Here we present Keck/KCWI and Very Large Telescope/MUSE observations of 11 of these QSO fields (19 pLLSs) that we combine with Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging to identify and characterize the absorber-associated galaxies at 0.16 ≲ z ≲ 0.84. We find 23 unique absorber-associated galaxies, with an average of one associated galaxy per absorber. For seven absorbers, all with <10% solar metallicities, we find no associated galaxies with logM⋆≳9.0 within ρ/R vir and ∣Δv∣/v esc ≤ 1.5 with respect to the absorber. We do not find any strong correlations between the metallicities or H i column densities of the gas and most of the galaxy properties, except for the stellar mass of the galaxies: the low-metallicity ([X/H] ≤ −1.4) systems have a probability of 0.39−0.15+0.16 for having a host galaxy with logM⋆≥9.0 within ρ/R vir ≤ 1.5, while the higher metallicity absorbers have a probability of 0.78−0.13+0.10 . This implies metal-enriched pLLSs/LLSs at z < 1 are typically associated with the CGM of galaxies with logM⋆>9.0 , whereas low-metallicity pLLSs/LLSs are found in more diverse locations, with one population arising in the CGM of galaxies and another more broadly distributed in overdense regions of the universe. Using absorbers not associated with galaxies, we estimate the unweighted geometric mean metallicity of the intergalactic medium to be [X/H] ≲ −2.1 at z < 1, which is lower than previously estimated.},

 abstract = {We use a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to systematically quantify the accretion rates of baryons into dark matter haloes and the resulting baryon mass fractions, as a function of halo mass, redshift and baryon type (including cold and hot gas). We find that the net baryonic accretion rates through the virial radius are sensitive to galactic outflows and explore a range of outflow parameters to illustrate the effects. We show that the cold gas accretion rate is in general not a simple universal factor of the dark matter accretion rate, and that galactic winds can cause star formation rates to deviate significantly from the external gas accretion rates, both via gas ejection and re-accretion. Furthermore, galactic winds can inject enough energy and momentum in the surrounding medium to slow down accretion altogether, especially in low-mass haloes and at low redshift, but the impact of outflows is suppressed with increasing halo mass. By resolving the accretion rates versus radius from the halo centres, we show how cold streams penetrate the hot atmospheres of massive haloes at z≥ 2, but gradually disappear at lower redshift. The total baryon mass fraction is also strongly suppressed by outflows in low-mass haloes, but is nearly universal in the absence of feedback in haloes above the UV background suppression scale, corresponding to circular velocities vc∼ 50 km s−1. The transition halo mass, at which the gas mass in haloes is equal for the cold and hot components, is roughly constant at ∼1011.5 M⊙ and does not depend sensitively on the wind prescription. We provide simple fitting formulae for the cold gas accretion rate and the corresponding efficiency with which dark matter channels cold gas into haloes in the no-wind case. Finally, we show that cold accretion is broadly consistent with driving the bulk of the highly star-forming galaxies observed at z∼ 2, but that the more intense star formers likely sample the high end of the accretion rate distribution, and may be additionally fuelled by a combination of gas recycling, gas re-accretion, hot mode cooling and mergers.},

 abstract = {We examine whether high-velocity clouds of neutral hydrogen (not the Magellanic Stream), observed in every longitude quadrant of the sky, can condense from a hot, dynamic corona above the plane of the Galaxy. Supernova-heated gas that arises above the disk must either flow outward as a wind or remain bound to the Galaxy in a dynamic corona in which gas is constantly in motion: a static corona is not stable. Since clouds cannot condense in a wind, we favor a corona and show that it is consistent with current values for the supernova heating rate above the disk. Gas continuously entering the corona from the disk rises up (in Z) and outward (in ..omega..) in an attempt to reach static equilibrium with the corona. The gas behaves adiabatically until radiative losses become important. Then, coronal gas is susceptible to thermal instabilities and neutral clouds condense from the corona. Clouds form toward the top of the corona at about one density scale height because thermal instabilities grow most rapidly there. After formation, clouds fall ballistically toward their point of origin.},

 abstract = {We have used the NIHAO simulations to explore how supernovae (SNe) affect star formation in galaxies. We find that SN feedback operates on all scales from the interstellar medium (ISM) to several virial radii. SNe regulate star formation by preventing condensation of HI into H$_2$ and by moving cold neutral gas to the hot HII phase. The first effect explains why the cold neutral gas in dwarf galaxies forms stars inefficiently. The second maintains the hot ISM of massive galaxies (HII vents out at lower masses). At $v_{\rm vir}\simeq 67{\rm\,km\,s}^{-1}$, the outflow rate follows the relation: $\dot{M}_{\rm out}=23\,(v_{\rm vir}/67{\rm\,km\,s}^{-1})^{-4.6}\,{\rm SFR}$. $20\%$ to $70\%$ of the gas expelled from galaxies escapes from the halo (ejective feedback) but outflows are dominated by cold swept-up gas, most of which falls back onto the galaxy on a $\sim 1\,$Gyr timescale. This `fountain feedback' reduces the masses of galaxies by a factor of two to four, since gas spends half to three quarter of its time in the fountain. Less than $10\%$ of the ejected gas mixes with the hot circumgalactic medium and this gas is usually not reaccreted. On scales as large as $6r_{\rm vir}$, galactic winds divert the incoming gas from cosmic filaments and prevent if from accreting onto galaxies (pre-emptive feedback). This process is the main reason for the low baryon content of ultradwarves.},

 abstract = {We examine the properties of atomic hydrogen (H I) associated with galaxies in the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) simulations of galaxy formation. EAGLE’s feedback parameters were calibrated to reproduce the stellar mass function and galaxy sizes at z=0.1, and we assess whether this calibration also yields realisticHI properties. We estimate the self-shielding density with a fitting function calibrated using radiation transport simulations, and correct for molecular hydrogen with empirical or theoretical relations. The ‘standard-resolution’ simulations systematically underestimate HI column densities, leading to an HI deficiency in low-mass (M_ < 1010M_) galaxies and poor reproduction of the observed HI mass function. These shortcomings are largely absent from EAGLE simulations featuring a factor of 8 (2) bettermass (spatial) resolution, within which the HI mass of galaxies evolves more mildly from z = 1 to 0 than in the standard-resolution simulations. The largest volume simulation reproduces the observed clustering of HI systems, and its dependence on HI richness. At fixed M_, galaxies acquire more HI in simulations with stronger feedback, as they become associated with more massive haloes and higher infall rates. They acquire less HI in simulations with a greater star formation efficiency, since the star formation and feedback necessary to balance the infall rate is produced by smaller gas reservoirs. The simulations indicate that the HI of present-day galaxies was acquired primarily by the smooth accretion of ionized, intergalactic gas at z _ 1, which later self-shields, and that only a small fraction is contributed by the reincorporation of gas previously heated strongly by feedback. HI reservoirs are highly dynamic: over 40 per cent of HI associated with z = 0.1 galaxies is converted to stars or ejected by z = 0.},

 abstract = {Low-ionization-state Mg ii gas has been extensively studied in quasar sightline observations to understand the cool, ∼104 K gas in the circumgalactic medium. Motivated by recent observations showing that the Mg ii gas around low-redshift galaxies has significant angular momentum, we use the high-resolution EAGLE cosmological simulation to analyze the morphological and rotation structures of the z ≈ 0.3 circumgalactic Mg ii gas and examine how they change with the host galaxy properties. Around star-forming galaxies, we find that the Mg ii gas has an axisymmetric instead of a spherical distribution, and the axis of symmetry aligns with that of the Mg ii gas rotation. A similar rotating structure is less commonly found in the small sample of simulated quiescent galaxies. We also examine how often Mg ii gas around galaxies selected using a line-of-sight velocity cut includes gas physically outside of the virial radius (rvir). For example, we show that at an impact parameter of 100 pkpc, a ±500 km s−1 velocity cut around galaxies with stellar masses of 109–109.5 M⊙ (1010–1010.5 M⊙) selects Mg ii gas beyond the virial radius 80% (6%) of the time. Because observers typically select Mg ii gas around target galaxies using such a velocity cut, we discuss how this issue affects the study of circumgalactic Mg ii gas properties, including the detection of corotation. While the corotating Mg ii gas generally extends beyond 0.5rvir, the Mg ii gas outside of the virial radius contaminates the corotation signal and makes observers less likely to conclude that gas at large impact parameters (e.g., ≳0.25rvir) is corotating.},

 abstract = {We use one of the highest resolution cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to date to demonstrate that cold gaseous clouds form around Milky Way-size galaxies. We further explore mechanisms responsible for their formation and show that a large fraction of clouds originate as a consequence of late-time filamentary “cold mode” accretion. Here, filaments that are still colder and denser than the surrounding halo gas are not able to connect directly to galaxies, as they do at high redshift, but are instead susceptible to the combined action of cooling and Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities at intermediate radii within the halo leading to the production of cold, dense pressure-confined clouds, without an associated dark matter component. This process is aided through the compression of the incoming filaments by the hot halo gas and expanding shocks during the halo buildup. Our mechanism directly seeds clouds from gas with substantial local overdensity, unlike in previous models, and provides a channel for the origin of cloud complexes. These clouds can later “rain” onto galaxies, delivering fuel for star formation. Owing to the relatively large cross-section of filaments and the net angular momentum carried by the gas, the clouds will be distributed in a modestly flattened region around a galaxy.},

 abstract = {We present two new Lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both SPH and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume ‘overlap’. We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity and cosmological integration, in the code gizmo:1 this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require ‘artificial diffusion’ terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow, so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages versus SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced ‘particle noise’ and numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, and sharp shock-capturing. Advantages versus non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors and numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of ‘grid alignment’ effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous discs, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize ‘grid noise’. These differences are important for a range of astrophysical problems.},

 abstract = {In this study we explore the complex multi-phase gas of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding galaxies. We propose and implement a novel, super-Lagrangian 'CGM zoom' scheme in the moving-mesh code AREPO, which focuses more resolution into the CGM and intentionally lowers resolution in the dense ISM. We run two cosmological simulations of the same galaxy halo, once with a simple 'no feedback' model, and separately with a more comprehensive physical model including galactic-scale outflows as in the Illustris simulation. Our chosen halo has a total mass of ~10^12 Msun at z ~ 2, and we achieve a median gas mass (spatial) resolution of ~2,200 solar masses (~95 parsecs) in the CGM, six-hundred (fourteen) times better than in the Illustris-1 simulation, a higher spatial resolution than any cosmological simulation at this mass scale to date. We explore the primary channel(s) of cold-phase CGM gas production in this regime. We find that winds substantially enhance the amount of cold gas in the halo, also evidenced in the covering fractions of HI and the equivalent widths of MgII out to large radii, in better agreement with observations than the case without galactic winds. Using a tracer particle analysis to follow the thermodynamic history of gas, we demonstrate how the majority of this cold, dense gas arises due to rapid cooling of the wind material interacting with the hot halo, and how large amounts of cold, ~10^4 K gas can be produced and persist in galactic halos with Tvir ~ 10^6 K. At the resolutions presently considered, the quantitative properties of the CGM we explore are not appreciably affected by the refinement scheme.},

from z = 0–6. For the first time, our simulations agree reasonably well with the observed mass–metallicity relations at z = 0–3 for a broad range of galaxy masses. We predict the evolution of the MZR from z = 0–6, as log(Z_(gas)/Z_☉) = 12+log(O/H)-9.0 = 0.35 [log(M_*/M_☉) - 10] + 0.93exp(-0.43z) - 1.05 and log(Z_*/Z_☉) = [Fe=H] + 0.2 = 0.40 [log(M_*/M_☉)-10]+0.67exp(-0.50z)-1.04, for gas-phase and stellar metallicity, respectively. 
Our simulations suggest that the evolution of MZR is associated with the evolution of stellar/gas mass fractions at different redshifts, indicating the existence of a universal metallicity relation between stellar mass, gas mass, and metallicities. In our simulations, galaxies 
above M_* = 10^6 M_☉ are able to retain a large fraction of their metals inside the halo, because metal-rich winds fail to escape completely and are recycled into the galaxy. This resolves a long-standing discrepancy between “sub-grid” wind models (and semi-analytic models) and 
observations, where common sub-grid models cannot simultaneously reproduce the MZR and the stellar mass functions.},

Using Omega25, a suite of cosmological simulations that incorporate both dark matter and gas dynamics with differing treatments of gas cooling, star formation, and thermal feedback, we systematically explore the physics that governs cosmic accretion into halos and their galaxies. Physically meaningful cosmic accretion of both dark matter and baryons occurs at z ≳ 1 ?> across our halo mass range: M 200 m = 10 11 − 14 M ⊙ ?> . However, dark matter, because it is dissipationless, is deposited (in a time-average sense) at ≳ R 200 m ( z ) ?> in a shell-like manner, such that dark matter mass and density experience little-to-no physical growth at any radius within a halo at z < 1 ?> . In contrast, gas, because it is able to cool radiatively, experiences significant accretion at all radii, at a rate that roughly tracks the accretion rate at R 200 m ?> , at all redshifts. Infalling gas starts to decouple from dark matter at ≈ 2 R 200 m ?> and continues to accrete to smaller radii until the onset of strong angular-momentum support at ≈ 0.1 R 200 m ?> . Thus, while the growth of dark matter is subject to pseudo-evolution, the growth of baryons is not. The fact that the accretion rate of gas on galactic scales tracks the accretion rate near R 200 m ?> provides insight into the tight relations between the masses/sizes of galaxies and those of their host halos across cosmic time.},

Here we discuss the properties of our survey and the immediate empirical results. We find singly and doubly ionized metal species, and H i typically have similar velocity profiles, implying they probe gas in the same or similar environments. The ionic ratios (e.g., / , / ) indicate that the gas in these absorbers is largely ionized, and the ionization conditions are quite comparable across the sampled range.

The Mg ii column densities span >2 orders of magnitude at any given , indicating a wide range of metallicities (from solar to <1/100 solar). In the range of , there is a gap in the distribution corresponding to gas with ∼10% solar metallicity, consistent with the gap seen in the previously identified bimodal metallicity distribution in this column density regime. Less than 3% of the absorbers in our sample show no detectable metal absorption, implying that truly pristine gas at is uncommon.

With a 5-hour Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) integration in a ∼500 × 500 kpc2 region centred at the quasar position, we achieve a ≥80 per cent complete spectroscopic survey of continuum-detected galaxies with mR ≤ 25 mag and Lyα emitters with luminosity LLyα ≥ 3 × 1041 erg s− 1. We do not identify galaxies at the redshift of a z ∼ 3.2 Lyman limit system (LLS) with log Z/Z⊙ = −3.35 ± 0.05, placing this gas cloud in the intergalactic medium or circumgalactic medium of a galaxy below our sensitivity limits. Conversely, we detect five Lyα emitters at the redshift of a pristine z ∼ 3.1 LLS with log Z/Z⊙ ≤ −3.8, while ∼0.4 sources were expected given the z ∼ 3 Lyα luminosity function. Both this high detection rate and the fact that at least three emitters appear aligned in projection with the LLS suggest that this pristine cloud is tracing a gas filament that is feeding one or multiple galaxies. Our observations uncover two different environments for metal-poor LLSs, implying a complex link between these absorbers and galaxy haloes, which ongoing MUSE surveys will soon explore in detail. Moreover, in agreement with recent MUSE observations, we detected a ∼ 90 kpc Lyα nebula at the quasar redshift and three Lyα emitters reminiscent of a ‘dark galaxy’ population.},

 abstract = {We present uniformly measured star formation histories (SFHs) of 40 Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies based on color–magnitude diagram (CMD) analysis from archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We demonstrate that accurate SFHs can be recovered from CMDs that do not reach the oldest main sequence turn-off (MSTO), but emphasize that the oldest MSTO is critical for precisely constraining the earliest epochs of star formation. We find that: (1) the average lifetime SFHs of dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) can be approximated by an exponentially declining SFH with τ ∼ 5 Gyr; (2) lower luminosity dSphs are less likely to have extended SFHs than more luminous dSphs; (3) the average SFHs of dwarf irregulars (dIrrs), transition dwarfs, and dwarf ellipticals can be approximated by the combination of an exponentially declining SFH (τ ∼ 3–4 Gyr) for lookback ages >10–12 Gyr ago and a constant SFH thereafter; (4) the observed fraction of stellar mass formed prior to z = 2 ranges considerably (80% for galaxies with M < 105 M☉ to 30% for galaxies with M > 107 M☉) and is largely explained by environment; (5) the distinction between “ultra-faint” and “classical” dSphs is arbitrary; (6) LG dIrrs formed a significantly higher fraction of stellar mass prior to z = 2 than the Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies from Leitner and the SFHs from the abundance matching models of Behroozi et al. This may indicate higher than expected star formation efficiencies at early times in low mass galaxies. Finally, we provide all the SFHs in tabulated electronic format for use by the community.},

 abstract = {As computational pipelines become a bigger part of science, it is important to ensure that the results are reproducible, a concern which has come to the fore in recent years. All developed software should be able to be run automatically without any user intervention. In addition to being valuable to the wider community, which may wish to reproduce or extend a published analysis, reproducible research practices allow for better control over the project by the original authors themselves. For example, keeping a non-executable record of parameters and command line arguments leads to error-prone analysis and opens up the possibility that, when the results are to be written up for publication, the researcher will no longer be able to even completely describe the process that led to them. For large projects, the use of multiple computational cores (either in a multi-core machine or distributed across a compute cluster) is necessary to obtain results in a useful time frame. Furthermore, it is often the case that, as the project evolves, it becomes necessary to save intermediate results while down-stream analyses are designed (or re-designed) and implemented. Under many frameworks, this causes having a single point of entry for the computation becomes increasingly difficult. Jug is a software framework which addresses these issues by caching intermediate results and distributing the computational work as tasks across a network. Jug is written in Python without the use of compiled modules, is completely cross-platform, and available as free software under the liberal MIT license.

 abstract = {Numerous observations indicate that galaxies need a continuous gas supply to fuel star formation and explain the star formation history. However, direct observational evidence of gas accretion remains rare. Using the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamic simulation suite, we study cold gas accretion onto galaxies and the observational signatures of the cold gas kinematics. For EAGLE galaxies at z = 0.27, we find that cold gas accretes onto galaxies anisotropically with typical inflow speeds between 20 and 60 km s−1. Most of these galaxies have comparable mass inflow rates and star formation rates, implying that the cold inflowing gas plausibly accounts for sustaining the star-forming activities of the galaxies. As motivation for future work to compare the cold gas kinematics with measurements from quasar sightline observations, we select an EAGLE galaxy with an extended cold gas disk, and we probe the cold gas using mock quasar sightlines. We demonstrate that by viewing the disk edge on, sightlines at azimuthal angles below 10° and impact parameters out to 60 pkpc can detect cold gas that corotates with the galaxy disk. This example suggests that cold gas disks extending beyond the optical disks possibly explain the sightline observations that detect corotating cold gas near galaxy major axes.},

 We present a detailed analysis of 99 optically thin C iii absorption systems at redshift 0.2 ≤ z ≤ 0.9 associated with neutral hydrogen column densities in the range 15 ≤ log $N({\rm{H\,{\small I}}})$ (cm−2) ≤ 16.2. Using photoionization models, we infer the number density (nH), C-abundance ([C/H]), and line-of-sight thickness (L) of these systems in the ranges −3.4 ≤ log nH (cm−3) ≤ −1.6, −1.6 ≤ [C/H] ≤ 0.4, and 1.3 pc ≤ L ≤ 10 kpc, respectively, with most of the systems having sub-kpc scale thickness. We combine the low-z and previously reported high-z (2.1 ≤ z ≤ 3.3) optically thin C iii systems to study the redshift evolution and various correlations between the derived physical parameters. We see a significant redshift evolution in nH, [C/H], and L. We compare the redshift evolution of metallicity in C iii systems with those of various types of absorption systems. We find that the slope of [C/H] versus z for C iii absorbers is steeper compared to the redshift evolution of cosmic metallicity of the damped Ly α sample (DLA) but consistent with that of sub-DLAs. We find the existence of strong anticorrelation between L and [C/H] for the combined sample with a significance level of 8.39σ. We see evidence of two distinct [C/H] branch C iii populations (low-[C/H] branch, $[\mathrm{ C/H}]\, \le -1.2$, and high-[C/H] branch, $[\mathrm{ C/H}]\, \gt -1.2$) in the combined C iii sample when divided appropriately in the L versus $N({\rm{C\,{\small III}}})$ plane. Further studies of C iii absorbers in the redshift range 1.0 ≤ z ≤ 2.0 are important to map the redshift evolution of these absorbers and gain insights into the time evolution physical conditions of the circumgalactic medium.},

 abstract = {We present new simulations of the formation of the Magellanic Stream based on an updated first-passage interaction history for the Magellanic Clouds, including both the Galactic and Magellanic Coronae and a live dark matter halo for the Milky Way. This new interaction history is needed because previously successful orbits need updating to account for the Magellanic Corona and the loosely bound nature of the Magellanic Group. These orbits involve two tidal interactions over the last 3.5 Gyr and reproduce the Stream’s position and appearance on the sky, mass distribution, and velocity profile. Most importantly, our simulated Stream is only ∼20 kpc away from the Sun at its closest point, whereas previous first-infall models predicted a distance of 100–200 kpc. This dramatic paradigm shift in the Stream’s 3D position would have several important implications. First, estimates of the observed neutral and ionized masses would be reduced by a factor of ∼5. Second, the stellar component of the Stream is also predicted to be <20 kpc away. Third, the enhanced interactions with the MW’s hot corona at this small distance would substantially shorten the Stream’s lifetime. Finally, the MW’s UV radiation field would be much stronger, potentially explaining the Hα emission observed along most of the Stream. Our prediction of a 20 kpc Stream could be tested by searching for UV absorption lines toward distant MW halo stars projected onto the Stream.},

 We examine the thermodynamic state and cooling of the low-z circumgalactic medium (CGM) in five FIRE-2 galaxy formation simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find that the CGM in these simulations is generally multiphase and dynamic, with a wide spectrum of largely non-linear density perturbations sourced by the accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium (IGM) and outflows from both the central and satellite galaxies. We investigate the origin of the multiphase structure of the CGM with a particle-tracking analysis and find that most of the low-entropy gas has cooled from the hot halo as a result of thermal instability triggered by these perturbations. The ratio of cooling to free-fall time-scales tcool/tff in the hot component of the CGM spans a wide range of ∼1−100 at a given radius but exhibits approximately constant median values of ∼5−20 at all radii 0.1Rvir < r < Rvir. These are similar to the ≈10−20 value typically adopted as the thermal instability threshold in ‘precipitation’ models of the ICM. Consequently, a one-dimensional model based on the assumption of a constant tcool/tff and hydrostatic equilibrium approximately reproduces the number density and entropy profiles of each simulation but only if it assumes the metallicity profile and temperature boundary condition taken directly from the simulation. We explicitly show that the tcool/tff value of a gas parcel in the hot component of the CGM does not predict its probability of subsequently accreting on to the central galaxy. This suggests that the value of tcool/tff is a poor predictor of thermal stability in gaseous haloes in which large-amplitude density perturbations are prevalent.},

 abstract = {Using high-resolution simulations with explicit treatment of stellar feedback physics based on the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments) project, we study how galaxy formation and the interstellar medium (ISM) are affected by magnetic fields, anisotropic Spitzer–Braginskii conduction and viscosity, and sub-grid metal diffusion from unresolved turbulence. We consider controlled simulations of isolated (non-cosmological) galaxies but also a limited set of cosmological ‘zoom-in’ simulations. Although simulations have shown significant effects from these physics with weak or absent stellar feedback, the effects are much weaker than those of stellar feedback when the latter is modelled explicitly. The additional physics have no systematic effect on galactic star formation rates (SFRs). In contrast, removing stellar feedback leads to SFRs being overpredicted by factors of ∼10–100. Without feedback, neither galactic winds nor volume-filling hot-phase gas exist, and discs tend to runaway collapse to ultra-thin scaleheights with unphysically dense clumps congregating at the galactic centre. With stellar feedback, a multi-phase, turbulent medium with galactic fountains and winds is established. At currently achievable resolutions and for the investigated halo mass range 10^(10)–10^(13) M⊙, the additional physics investigated here (magnetohydrodynamic, conduction, viscosity, metal diffusion) have only weak (∼10 per cent-level) effects on regulating SFR and altering the balance of phases, outflows or the energy in ISM turbulence, consistent with simple equipartition arguments. We conclude that galactic star formation and the ISM are primarily governed by a combination of turbulence, gravitational instabilities and feedback. We add the caveat that active galactic nucleus feedback is not included in the present work.},

 abstract = {The cosmic star formation rate is observed to drop sharply after redshift z = 2. We use two large, cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to investigate how this decline is related to the evolution of gas accretion and to outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the drop in the star formation rate follows a corresponding decline in the global cold-mode accretion rate density on to haloes, but with a delay of the order of the gas consumption time-scale in the interstellar medium. Here we define cold-mode (hot-mode) accretion as gas that is accreted and whose temperature never exceeded (did exceed) 105.5 K. In contrast to cold-mode accretion, which peaks at z ≈ 3, the hot mode continues to increase to z ≈ 1 and remains roughly constant thereafter. By the present time, the hot mode strongly dominates the global accretion rate on to haloes. Star formation does not track hot-mode halo accretion because most of the hot halo gas never accretes on to galaxies. AGN feedback plays a crucial role by preferentially preventing the gas that entered haloes in the hot mode from accreting on to their central galaxies. Consequently, in the absence of AGN feedback, gas accreted in the hot mode would become the dominant source of fuel for star formation and the drop-off in the cosmic star formation rate would be much less steep.},

 abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. 
 
 
 
In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5 M⊙ and near 0.08 M⊙. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. 
 
 
 
Determinations of the power-law indices α are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by Δα≈0.5 between 0.1 and 1 M⊙ than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto & Zoccali; Paresce & De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; Mendez & Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

We additionally report on the gas mass that becomes unbound from the LMC disk and swept by ram pressure into the Trailing Magellanic Stream. We find that, even for our largest outburst, the mass contribution to the Stream is still quite small, as much of the outflow-turned-halo gas is shielded on the LMCs far-side due to the LMCs primarily face-on infall through the Milky Way halo over the past Gyr. On the LMC’s near-side, past outflows have fought an uphill battle against ram pressure, with the near-side halo mass being at least a factor of a few smaller than that of the far-side.

 abstract = {Galactic winds and fountains driven by supernova-heated gas play an integral role in redistributing gas in galaxies, depositing metals in the circumgalactic medium, and quenching star formation. The interplay between these outflows and ram-pressure stripping (RPS) due to the galaxy’s motion through an ambient medium may enhance these effects by converting fountain flows into expelled gas. In this paper, we present controlled, 3D simulations of RPS combined with thermally driven, local outflows from clustered supernovae in an isolated disk galaxy modeled on the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a dwarf satellite of the Milky Way on its first infall. Observational evidence of local outflows emanating from supergiant shells in the LMC and a trailing filament of H i gas originating from these regions—with no obvious Leading Arm counterpart—may represent a perfect example of this process. Our simulations present a proof of concept that ram pressure can convert fountain flows into expelled gas. We find that fountains launched near the peak star formation time of the LMC can comprise part of the LMC filament in the Trailing Stream but with lower column densities than observed. Larger, more numerous outflows from the LMC may be possible and may contribute more mass, but higher-inertia gas will lengthen the timescale for this gas to be swept away by ram pressure. Given the high-resolution observations, increased knowledge of star formation histories, and growing evidence of multiphase ionized outflows, the LMC is an ideal test bed for future wind models.},

 abstract = {Galactic halo gas traces inflowing star-formation fuel and feedback from a galaxy's disk and is therefore crucial to our understanding of galaxy evolution. In this review, we summarize the multiwavelength observational properties and origin models of Galactic and low-redshift spiral galaxy halo gas. Galactic halos contain multiphase gas flows that are dominated in mass by the ionized component and extend to large radii. The densest, coldest halo gas observed in neutral hydrogen (Hi) is generally closest to the disk (<20 kpc), and absorption line results indicate warm and warm-hot diffuse halo gas is present throughout a galaxy's halo. The hot halo gas detected is not a significant fraction of a galaxy's baryons. The disk-halo interface is where the multiphase flows are integrated into the star-forming disk, and there is evidence for both feedback and fueling at this interface from its temperature and kinematic gradients, and Hi structures. The origin and fate of halo gas are considered in the context of c...},

We detect H i absorption with log N(H i) = 17.06 ± 0.05 as well as Mg ii, C iii, Si iii, and O vi in this system. The column densities are readily explained if this is a multi-phase system, with the intermediate and low ions arising in a very low metallicity ([Mg/H] = −1.71 ± 0.06) photoionized gas. We identify via Keck spectroscopy and Large Binocular Telescope imaging a 0.3 L* star-forming galaxy projected 37 kpc from the QSO at nearly identical redshift (z = 0.27406 and Δv = −26 km s−1) with near solar metallicity ([O/H] = −0.20 ± 0.15). The presence of very low metallicity gas in the proximity of a near-solar metallicity, sub-L* galaxy strongly suggests that the LLS probes gas infalling onto the galaxy. A search of the literature reveals that such low-metallicity LLSs are not uncommon. We found that 50% (4/8) of the well-studied z ≲ 1 LLSs have metallicities similar to the present system and show sub-L* galaxies with ρ < 100 kpc in those fields where redshifts have been surveyed. We argue that the properties of these primitive LLSs and their host galaxies are consistent with those of cold mode accretion streams seen in galaxy simulations.},

 abstract = {We investigate the nature of gas accretion onto haloes and galaxies at z=2 using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations run with the moving mesh code AREPO. Implementing a Monte Carlo tracer particle scheme to determine the origin and thermodynamic history of accreting gas, we make quantitative comparisons to an otherwise identical simulation run with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-3. Contrasting these two numerical approaches, we find significant physical differences in the thermodynamic history of accreted gas in haloes above 10^10.5 solar masses. In agreement with previous work, GADGET simulations show a cold fraction near unity for galaxies forming in massive haloes, implying that only a small percentage of accreted gas heats to an appreciable fraction of the virial temperature during accretion. The same galaxies in AREPO show a much lower cold fraction, <20% in haloes above 10^11 solar masses. This results from a hot gas accretion rate which, at this same halo mass, is an order of magnitude larger than with GADGET, while the cold accretion rate is also lower. These discrepancies increase for more massive systems, and we explain both as due to numerical inaccuracies in the standard formulation of SPH. We also observe that the relatively sharp transition from cold to hot mode dominated accretion, at a halo mass of ~10^11, is a consequence of comparing past gas temperatures to a constant threshold value independent of virial temperature. Examining the spatial distribution of accreting gas, we find that gas filaments in GADGET tend to remain collimated and flow coherently to small radii, or artificially fragment and form a large number of purely numerical "blobs". Similar gas streams in AREPO show increased heating and disruption at 0.25-0.5 virial radii and contribute to the hot gas accretion rate in a manner distinct from classical cooling flows.},

The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is fed by galaxy outflows and accretion of intergalactic gas, but its mass, heavy element enrichment, and relation to galaxy properties are poorly constrained by observations. In a survey of the outskirts of 42 galaxies with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we detected ubiquitous, large (150-kiloparsec) halos of ionized oxygen surrounding star-forming galaxies; we found much less ionized oxygen around galaxies with little or no star formation. This ionized CGM contains a substantial mass of heavy elements and gas, perhaps far exceeding the reservoirs of gas in the galaxies themselves. Our data indicate that it is a basic component of nearly all star-forming galaxies that is removed or transformed during the quenching of star formation and the transition to passive evolution.},

The observed bimodal distribution of the covering fraction with azimuthal angle, showing a higher frequency of absorption along the projected major and minor axes of galaxies, is not reproduced in the simulations. Further analysis reveals the spatial-kinematic distribution of -absorbing gas is dominated by outflows in the inner halo mixed with an inflowing gas that originates from farther out in the halo. Though the CGM of the individual simulated galaxies exhibits spatial structure, the flat azimuthal distribution occurs because the individual simulated galaxies do not develop a CGM structure that is universal from galaxy to galaxy.},

 abstract = {Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy evolution are increasingly able to produce realistic galaxies, but the largest hurdle remaining is in constructing subgrid models that accurately describe the behavior of stellar feedback. As an alternate way to test and calibrate such models, we propose to focus on the circumgalactic medium. To do so, we generate a suite of adaptive-mesh refinement (AMR) simulations for a Milky-Way-massed galaxy run to z=0, systematically varying the feedback implementation. We then post-process the simulation data to compute the absorbing column density for a wide range of common atomic absorbers throughout the galactic halo, including H I, Mg II, Si II, Si III, Si IV, C IV, N V, O VI, and O VII. The radial profiles of these atomic column densities are compared against several quasar absorption line studies, to determine if one feedback prescription is favored. We find that although our models match some of the observations (specifically those ions with lower ionization strengths), it is particularly difficult to match O VI observations. There is some indication that the models with increased feedback intensity are better matches. We demonstrate that sufficient metals exist in these halos to reproduce the observed column density distribution in principle, but the simulated circumgalactic medium lacks significant multiphase substructure and is generally too hot. Furthermore, we demonstrate the failings of inflow-only models (without energetic feedback) at populating the CGM with adequate metals to match observations even in the presence of multiphase structure. Additionally, we briefly investigate the evolution of the CGM from z=3 to present. Overall, we find that quasar absorption line observations of the gas around galaxies provide a new and important constraint on feedback models.},

Our simulations predict the presence of significant hot gas in the halos as early as z = 3–4, well before the halos ought to be able to sustain hot mode accretion in the conventional picture. The nascent coronae grow inside-out and initially do so primarily as a result of outflows from the central galaxies powered by merger-induced shock heating and strong supernova feedback, both of which are elemental features of today’s successful galaxy formation models. Furthermore, the outflows and the forming coronae also accelerate the transition from cold to hot mode accretion by contributing to the conditions for sustaining stable accretion shocks. They also disrupt the filamentary streams funneling cold gas onto the central galaxies by causing their mouths to fray into a broad delta, detach from the galaxies, and be pushed away to larger radii. And even though at early times the filaments repeatedly re-form, the hot gas and the outflows act to weaken the filaments and accelerate their ultimate disruption. Although galactic outflows are generally thought of as ejective feedback, we find that their action on the filaments suggests a preventive role as well.},

 We examine the properties of the low-redshift circumgalactic medium (CGM) around star-forming and quenched galaxies in the simba cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, focusing on comparing H i and metal line absorption to observations from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS)-Halos and COS-Dwarfs surveys. Halo baryon fractions are generally ${\lesssim}50{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the cosmic fraction due to stellar feedback at low masses, and jet-mode AGN feedback at high masses. Baryons and metals in the CGM of quenched galaxies are ${\gtrsim}90{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ hot gas, while the CGM of star-forming galaxies is more multiphase. Hot CGM gas has low metallicity, while warm and cool CGM gas have metallicity close to that of galactic gas. Equivalent widths, covering fractions and total path absorption of H i and selected metal lines (Mg ii, Si iii, C iv, and O vi) around a matched sample of simba star-forming galaxies are mostly consistent with COS-Halos and COS-Dwarfs observations to ${\lesssim}0.4$ dex, depending on ion and assumed ionizing background. Around matched quenched galaxies, absorption in all ions is lower, with H i absorption significantly underpredicted. Metal-line absorption is sensitive to choice of photoionizing background; assuming recent backgrounds, simba matches O vi but underpredicts low ions, while an older background matches low ions but underpredicts O vi. Simba reproduces the observed dichotomy of O vi absorption around star-forming and quenched galaxies. CGM metals primarily come from stellar feedback, while jet-mode AGN feedback reduces absorption particularly for lower ions.},

 abstract = {The ionizing background determines the ionization balance and the thermodynamics of the cosmic gas. It is therefore a fundamental ingredient to theoretical and empirical studies of both the intergalactic medium (IGM) and galaxy formation. We present here a new calculation of its spectrum that satisfies the empirical constraints we recently obtained by combining state-of-the-art luminosity functions and intergalactic opacity measurements. In our preferred model, star-forming galaxies and quasars each contribute substantially to the H i ionizing field at z < 3, with galaxies rapidly overtaking quasars at higher redshifts as quasars become rarer. In addition to our fiducial model, we explore the physical dependences of the calculated background and clarify how recombination emission contributes to the ionization rates. We find that recombinations do not simply boost the ionization rates by the number of re-emitted ionizing photons as many of these rapidly redshift below the ionization edges and have a distribution of energies. A simple analytic model that captures the main effects seen in our numerical radiative transfer calculations is given. Finally, we discuss the effects of He ii reionization by quasars on both the spectrum of the ionizing background and on the thermal history of the IGM. In regions that have yet to be reionized, the spectrum is expected to be almost completely suppressed immediately above 54.4 eV, while a background of higher energy (≳0.5 keV) photons permeates the entire universe owing to the frequency dependence of the photoionization cross section. We provide an analytical model of the heat input during He ii reionization and its effects on the temperature–density relation.},

 We present an analysis of the origin and properties of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in a suite of 11 cosmological zoom simulations resembling present-day spiral galaxies. On average the galaxies retain about 50 per cent of the cosmic fraction in baryons, almost equally divided into disc (interstellar medium) gas, cool CGM gas and warm-hot CGM gas. At radii smaller than 50 kpc the CGM is dominated by recycled warm-hot gas injected from the central galaxy, while at larger radii it is dominated by cool gas accreted on to the halo. The recycled gas typically accounts for one-third of the CGM mass. We introduce the novel publicly available analysis tool pygad to compute ion abundances and mock absorption spectra. For Lyman α absorption, we find good agreement of the simulated equivalent width (EW) distribution and observations out to large radii. Disc galaxies with quiescent assembly histories show significantly more absorption along the disc major axis. By comparing the EW and H i column densities, we find that CGM Lyman α absorbers are best represented by an effective line width b ≈ 50–70 km s−1 that increases mildly with halo mass, larger than typically assumed.},

 abstract = {The shape of a galaxy's spatially unresolved, globally integrated 21-cm emission line depends on its internal gas kinematics: galaxies with rotationally supported gas discs produce double-horned profiles with steep wings, while galaxies with dispersion-supported gas produce Gaussian-like profiles with sloped wings. Using mock observations of simulated galaxies from the FIRE project, we show that one can therefore constrain a galaxy's gas kinematics from its unresolved 21-cm line profile. In particular, we find that the kurtosis of the 21-cm line increases with decreasing V/σ and that this trend is robust across a wide range of masses, signal-to-noise ratios, and inclinations. We then quantify the shapes of 21-cm line profiles from a morphologically unbiased sample of ~2000 low-redshift, HI-detected galaxies with M star = 107-11 M☉ and compare to the simulated galaxies. At M star ≳ 1010 M☉, both the observed and simulated galaxies produce double-horned profiles with low kurtosis and steep wings, consistent with rotationally supported discs. Both the observed and simulated line profiles become more Gaussian like (higher kurtosis and less-steep wings) at lower masses, indicating increased dispersion support. However, the simulated galaxies transition from rotational to dispersion support more strongly: at M star 108-10 M, most of the simulations produce more Gaussian-like profiles than typical observed galaxies with similar mass, indicating that gas in the low-mass simulated galaxies is, on average, overly dispersion supported. Most of the lower-mass-simulated galaxies also have somewhat lower gas fractions than the median of the observed population. The simulations nevertheless reproduce the observed line-width baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, which is insensitive to rotational versus dispersion support.},

 Recent searches for the hosts of z ∼ 4 damped Ly α absorbers (DLAs) have detected bright galaxies at distances of tens of kpc from the DLA. Using the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom simulations, we argue that these relatively large distances are due to a predominantly cool and neutral inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding high-redshift galaxies. The inner CGM is cool because of the short cooling time of hot gas in ${\lesssim}10^{12}\, {\rm M_{\odot }}$ haloes, which implies that accretion and feedback energy are radiated quickly, while it is neutral due to high volume densities and column densities at high redshift that shield cool gas from photoionization. Our analysis predicts large DLA covering factors (${\gtrsim}50{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$) out to impact parameters ∼0.3[(1 + z)/5]3/2Rvir from the central galaxies at z ≳ 1, equivalent to a proper distance of ${\sim}21\, M_{12}^{1/3} \left(\left(1+z\right)/5\right)^{1/2}\, {\rm kpc}$ (Rvir and M12 are the halo virial radius and mass in units of $10^{12}\, {\rm M_{\odot }}$, respectively). This implies that DLA covering factors at z ∼ 4 may be comparable to unity out to a distance ∼10 times larger than stellar half-mass radii. A predominantly neutral inner CGM in the early universe suggests that its mass and metallicity can be directly constrained by absorption surveys, without resorting to the large ionization corrections as required for ionized CGM.},

 abstract = {We present a model for star formation and supernova feedback that describes the multiphase structure of star-forming gas on scales that are typically not resolved in cosmological simulations. Our approach includes radiative heating and cooling, the growth of cold clouds embedded in an ambient hot medium, star formation in these clouds, feedback from supernovae in the form of thermal heating and cloud evaporation, galactic winds and outflows, and metal enrichment. Implemented using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, our scheme is a significantly modified and extended version of the grid-based method of Yepes et al., and enables us to achieve a high dynamic range in simulations of structure formation. 
 
 
 
We discuss properties of the feedback model in detail and show that it predicts a self-regulated, quiescent mode of star formation, which, in particular, stabilizes the star-forming gaseous layers of disc galaxies. The parametrization of this mode can be reduced to a single free quantity that determines the overall time-scale for star formation. We fix this parameter numerically to match the observed rates of star formation in local disc galaxies. When normalized in this manner, cosmological simulations employing our model nevertheless overproduce the observed cosmic abundance of stellar material. We are thus motivated to extend our feedback model to include galactic winds associated with star formation. 
 
 
 
Using small-scale simulations of individual star-forming disc galaxies, we show that these winds produce either galactic fountains or outflows, depending on the depth of the gravitational potential. In low-mass haloes, winds can greatly suppress the overall efficiency of star formation. When incorporated into cosmological simulations, our combined model for star formation and winds predicts a cosmic star formation density that is consistent with observations, provided that the winds are sufficiently energetic. Moreover, outflows from galaxies in these simulations drive chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium – in principle, accounting for the presence of metals in the Lyman α forest.},

 abstract = {We present a new statistical method to determine the relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of their host dark matter haloes over the entire cosmic history from z � 4 to the present. This multi-epoch abundance matching (MEAM) model self-consistently takes into account that satellite galaxies first become satellites at times earlier than they are observed. We employ a redshift-dependent parameterization of the stellar-to-halo mass relation to populate haloes and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with galaxies, requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at several redshifts be reproduced simultaneously. We show that physically meaningful growth of massive galaxies is consistent with these data only if observational mass errors are taken into account. Using merger trees extracted from the dark matter simulations in combination with MEAM, we predict the average assembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within the galaxies (in-situ) and accretion of stars (ex-situ). Our main results are: The peak star formation efficiency decreases with redshift from 23 per cent at z = 0 to 9 per cent at z = 4 while the corresponding halo mass increases from 10 11.8 M⊙ to 10 12.5 M⊙. The star formation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halo mass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-mass galaxies the peak has not been reached yet. In haloes similar to that of the Milky-Way about half of the central stellar mass is assembled after z = 0.7. In low-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly of their central galaxies, while in massive haloes more than half of the central stellar mass is formed ex-situ with significant accretion of satellites at z < 2. We find that our method implies a cosmic star formation history and an evolution of specific star formation rates which are consistent with those inferred directly. We present convenient fitting functions for stellar masses, star formation rates, and accretion rates as functions of halo mass and redshift.},

We apply a multi-element analysis to quantify the amount of dust in these two classes of systems. We find that either the element depletion patterns in these systems differ from the Galactic depletion patterns or they have a different nucleosynthetic history than our own Galaxy. We propose a new method to derive the velocity width of absorption profiles, using the modelled Voigt profile features. The correlation between the velocity width Delta V-90 of the absorption profile and themetallicity is found to be tighter for DLAs than for sub-DLAs. We report hints of a bimodal distribution in the [Fe/H] metallicity of low redshift (z \textless 1.25) sub-DLAs, which is unseen at higher redshifts. This feature can be interpreted as a signature from the metal-poor, accreting gas and the metal-rich, outflowing gas, both being traced by sub-DLAs at low redshifts.},

 abstract = {We present an analysis of the angular momentum content of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) using TNG100, one of the flagship runs of the IllustrisTNG project. We focus on Milky Way–mass halos (∼1012 M⊙) at z = 0 but also analyze other masses and redshifts up to z = 5. We find that the CGM angular momentum properties are strongly correlated with the stellar angular momentum of the corresponding galaxy: the CGM surrounding high-angular momentum galaxies has a systematically higher angular momentum and is better aligned to the rotational axis of the galaxy itself than the CGM surrounding low-angular momentum galaxies. Both the hot and cold phases of the CGM show this dichotomy, though it is stronger for colder gas. The CGM of high-angular momentum galaxies is characterized by a large wedge of cold gas with rotational velocities at least ∼1/2 of the halo’s virial velocity, extending out to ∼1/2 of the virial radius, and by biconical polar regions dominated by radial velocities suggestive of galactic fountains; both of these features are absent from the CGM of low-angular momentum galaxies. These conclusions are general to halo masses ≲1012 M⊙ and for z ≲ 2, but they do not apply for more massive halos or at the highest redshift studied. By comparing simulations run with alterations to the fiducial feedback model, we identify the better alignment of the CGM to high-angular momentum galaxies as a feedback-independent effect and the galactic winds as a dominant influence on the CGM’s angular momentum.},

 abstract = {Many of the baryons associated with a galaxy reside in its circumgalactic medium (CGM), in a diffuse volume-filling phase at roughly the virial temperature. Much of the oxygen produced over cosmic time by the galaxy’s stars also ends up there. The resulting absorption lines in the spectra of UV and X-ray background sources are powerful diagnostics of the feedback processes that prevent more of those baryons from forming stars. This paper presents predictions for CGM absorption lines (O vi, O vii, O viii, Ne viii, N v) that are based on precipitation-regulated feedback models, which posit that the radiative cooling time of the ambient medium cannot drop much below 10 times the freefall time without triggering a strong feedback event. The resulting predictions align with many different observational constraints on the Milky Way’s ambient CGM and explain why NO vi ≈ 1014 cm−2 over large ranges in halo mass and projected radius. Within the precipitation framework, the strongest O vi absorption lines result from vertical mixing of the CGM that raises low-entropy ambient gas to greater altitudes, because adiabatic cooling of the uplifted gas then lowers its temperature and raises the fractional abundance of O5+. Condensation stimulated by uplift may also produce associated low-ionization components. The observed velocity structure of the O vi absorption suggests that galactic outflows do not expel circumgalactic gas at the halo’s escape velocity, but rather drive circulation that dissipates much of the galaxy’s supernova energy within the ambient medium, causing some of it to expand beyond the virial radius.},

We focus here on 82 partial Lyman limit systems (pLLSs, 16.2 ≤ < 17.2) and 29 LLSs (17.2 ≤ < 19). Using Bayesian techniques and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of a grid of photoionization models, we derive the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) for the metallicity of each absorber in CCC. We show that the combined pLLS metallicity PDF at z ≲ 1 has two main peaks at ≃ −1.7 and −0.4, with a strong dip at ≃ −1. The metallicity PDF of the LLSs might be more complicated than a unimodal or bimodal distribution. The pLLSs and LLSs probe a similar range of metallicities −3 ≲ ≲ +0.4, but the fraction of very metal-poor absorbers with ≲ −1.4 is much larger for the pLLSs than the LLSs. In contrast, absorbers with ≥ 19 have mostly −1 ≲ ≲ 0 at z ≲ 1. The metal-enriched gas probed by pLLSs and LLSs confirms that galaxies that have been enriching their CGM over billions of years. Surprisingly, despite this enrichment, there is also abundant metal-poor CGM gas (41%–59% of the pLLSs have ≲ −1.4), representing a reservoir of near-pristine gas around z ≲ 1 galaxies. We compare our empirical results to recent cosmological zoom simulations, finding some discrepancies, including an overabundance of metal-enriched CGM gas in simulations.},

 abstract = {We use a sample of 27 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at redshift z = 2–6 to probe the outflows in their respective host galaxies (log(M */M ⊙) ∼ 9–11) and search for possible relations between the outflow properties and those of the host galaxies, such as M *, the star formation rate (SFR), and the specific SFR (sSFR). First, we consider three outflow properties: outflow column density (N out), maximum outflow velocity (V max), and normalized maximum velocity (V norm = V max/V circ,halo, where V circ,halo is the halo circular velocity). We observe clear trends of N out and V max with increasing SFR in high-ion-traced outflows, with a stronger (>3σ) V max–SFR correlation. We find that the estimated mass outflow rate and momentum flux of the high-ion outflows scale with SFR and can be supported by the momentum imparted by star formation (supernovae and stellar winds). The kinematic correlations of high-ion-traced outflows with SFR are similar to those observed for star-forming galaxies at low redshifts. The correlations with SFR are weaker in low-ion outflows. This, along with the lower detection fraction in low-ion outflows, indicates that the outflow is primarily high-ion dominated. We also observe a strong (>3σ) trend of normalized velocity (V norm) decreasing with halo mass and increasing with sSFR, suggesting that outflows from low-mass halos and high-sSFR galaxies are most likely to escape and enrich the outer circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium with metals. By comparing the CGM–GRB stacks with those of starbursts at z ∼ 2 and z ∼ 0.1, we find that over a broad redshift range, the outflow strength strongly depends on the main-sequence offset at the respective redshifts, rather than simply the SFR.},

 We explore the expected galaxy environments of $\mathrm{C\, \small {IV}}$ absorbers at z > 5 using the Technicolor Dawn simulations. These simulations reproduce the observed history of reionization, the z ∼ 6 galaxy stellar mass function, the Ly α forest transmission at z > 5, and the $\mathrm{Si\, \small {IV}}$ column density distribution (CDD) at z ≈ 5.5. None the less, the $\mathrm{C\, \small {IV}}$ CDD remains underproduced. Comparison with observed $\mathrm{C\, \small {II}}/\mathrm{Si\, \small {II}}$ equivalent width ratios and the $\mathrm{C\, \small {II}}$ line incidence suggests that a low carbon yield accounts for some, but not all, of the $\mathrm{C\, \small {IV}}$ discrepancy. Alternatively, a density-bounded escape scenario could harden the metagalactic ionizing background more dramatically even than binary stellar evolution, boosting the $\mathrm{C\, \small {IV}}$ CDD into near agreement with observations. In this case, galaxies ionize more efficiently and fewer are required to host a given high-ionization absorber. Absorbers’ environments therefore constrain ionizing escape. Regardless of the escape scenario, galaxies correlate with $\mathrm{C\, \small {IV}}$ absorbers out to 300 proper kpc (pkpc). The correlation strengthens independently with galaxy luminosity and $\mathrm{C\, \small {IV}}$ column density. Around strong systems ($\log (N_\mathrm{C\, \small {IV}}/{\rm cm}^{-2})\gt 14)$), the overdensity of galaxies with MUV < −18 or log (LLy α/erg s−1) > 41.9 declines from 200–300 within 100 pkpc to 40–60 within 250 pkpc. The previously suggested association between strong $\mathrm{C\, \small {IV}}$ absorbers and Ly α emitters at z > 5 is not expected. It may arise if both populations inhabit large-scale voids, but for different reasons. Although most neighbouring galaxies are too faint for HST, JWST will, with a single pointing, identify ∼10 neighbouring galaxies per strong $\mathrm{C\, \small {IV}}$ absorber at z > 5. Ground-based tests of these predictions are possible via deep surveys for Ly α emission using integral field units.},

 abstract = {We test if the cosmological zoom-in simulations of isolated galaxies from the FIRE project reproduce the properties of ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We show that outflows that dynamically heat galactic stars, together with a passively aging stellar population after imposed quenching, naturally reproduce the observed population of red UDGs, without the need for high spin haloes, or dynamical influence from their host cluster. We reproduce the range of surface brightness, radius, and absolute magnitude of the observed red UDGs by quenching simulated galaxies at a range of different times. They represent a mostly uniform population of dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies with M * ~ 108 M☉, low metallicity, and a broad range of ages; the more massive the UDGs, the older they are. The most massive red UDG in our sample(M * ~ 3 × 108 M☉) requires quenching at z ~ 3 when its halo reached M h ~ 1011M☉. Our simulated UDGs form with normal stellar-to-halo ratios and match the central enclosed masses and the velocity dispersions of the observed UDGs. Enclosed masses remain largely fixed across a broad range of quenching times because the central regions of their dark matter haloes complete their growth early. If our simulated dwarfs are not quenched, they evolve into bluer low surface brightness galaxies with M/L similar to observed field dwarfs. While our simulation sample covers a limited range of formation histories and halo masses, we predict that UDG is a common, and perhaps even dominant, galaxy type around M * ~ 108 M☉, both in the field and in clusters.},

 abstract = {We present the fourth simulation of the Cholla Galactic OutfLow Simulations suite. Using a physically motivated prescription for clustered supernova feedback, we successfully drive a multiphase outflow from a disk galaxy. The high resolution (<5 pc) across a relatively large domain (20 kpc) allows us to capture the hydrodynamic mixing and dynamical interactions between the hot and cool (T ∼ 104 K) phases in the outflow, which in turn leads to direct evidence of a qualitatively new mechanism for cool gas acceleration in galactic winds. We show that mixing of momentum from the hot phase to the cool phase accelerates the cool gas to 800 km s−1 on kiloparsec scales, with properties inconsistent with the physical models of ram pressure acceleration or bulk cooling from the hot phase. The mixing process also affects the hot phase, modifying its radial profiles of temperature, density, and velocity from the expectations of radial supersonic flow. This mechanism provides a physical explanation for the high-velocity, blueshifted, low-ionization absorption lines often observed in the spectra of starburst and high-redshift galaxies.},

We study wind recycling at the halo scale, i.e. gas that has been ejected beyond the halo virial radius, and at the galaxy scale, i.e. gas that has been ejected from the interstellar medium to at least $\approx 10 \, {{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the virial radius. Galaxy-scale wind recycling is generally inefficient, with a characteristic return time-scale that is comparable to or longer than a Hubble time, and with an efficiency that clearly peaks at the characteristic halo mass of $M_{200} = 10^{12} \, \mathrm{M_\odot }$. Correspondingly, the majority of gas being accreted on to galaxies in eagle is infalling for the first time. Recycling is more efficient at the halo scale, with values that differ by orders of magnitude from those assumed by semi-analytical galaxy formation models. Differences in the efficiency of wind recycling with other hydrodynamical simulations are currently difficult to assess, but are likely smaller. We find that cumulative first-time gas accretion rates at the virial radius are reduced relative to the expectation from dark matter accretion for haloes with mass $M_{200} \lt 10^{12} \, \mathrm{M_\odot }$, indicating efficient preventative feedback on halo scales.},

 abstract = {We study the connections between ongoing star formation, galaxy mass, and extended halo gas, in order to distinguish between starburst-driven outflows and infalling clouds that produce the majority of observed Mg ii absorbers at large galactic radii (≳10 h−1 kpc) and to gain insights into halo gas contents around galaxies. We present new measurements of total stellar mass (Mstar), Hα emission line strength (EW(Hα)), and specific star formation rate (sSFR) for the 94 galaxies described by Chen et al.'s 2010 paper. We find that the extent of Mg ii absorbing gas, , scales with Mstar and sSFR, following . The strong dependence of on Mstar is most naturally explained, if more massive galaxies possess more extended halos of cool gas and the observed Mg ii absorbers arise in infalling clouds which will subsequently fuel star formation in the galaxies. The additional scaling relation of with sSFR can be understood either as accounting for extra gas supplies due to starburst outflows or as correcting for suppressed cool gas content in high-mass halos. The latter is motivated by the well-known sSFR–Mstar inverse correlation in field galaxies. Our analysis shows that a joint study of galaxies and Mg ii absorbers along common sight lines provides an empirical characterization of halo gaseous radius versus halo mass. A comparison study of around red- and blue-sequence galaxies may provide the first empirical constraint for resolving the physical origin of the observed sSFR–Mstar relation in galaxies.},

We present the design philosophy and summarize the key characteristics of the instrument that will be of interest to potential observers. For faint targets, with flux Fλ ≈ 1.0 × 10−14 erg cm−2 s−1 Å−1, COS can achieve comparable signal to noise (when compared to Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph echelle modes) in 1%–2% of the observing time. This has led to a significant increase in the total data volume and data quality available to the community. For example, in the first 20 months of science operation (2009 September–2011 June) the cumulative redshift pathlength of extragalactic sight lines sampled by COS is nine times than sampled at moderate resolution in 19 previous years of Hubble observations. COS programs have observed 214 distinct lines of sight suitable for study of the intergalactic medium as of 2011 June. COS has measured, for the first time with high reliability, broad Lyα absorbers and Ne viii in the intergalactic medium, and observed the He ii reionization epoch along multiple sightlines. COS has detected the first CO emission and absorption in the UV spectra of low-mass circumstellar disks at the epoch of giant planet formation, and detected multiple ionization states of metals in extra-solar planetary atmospheres. In the coming years, COS will continue its census of intergalactic gas, probe galactic and cosmic structure, and explore physics in our solar system and Galaxy.},

 abstract = {Using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope, the COS Science Team has conducted a high signal-to-noise survey of 14 bright QSOs. In a previous paper, these far-UV spectra were used to discover 14 “warm” (T ⩾ 105 K) absorbers using a combination of broad Lyα and broad O vi absorptions. A reanalysis of a few of this new class of absorbers using slightly relaxed fitting criteria finds as many as 20 warm absorbers could be present in this sample. A shallow, wide spectroscopic galaxy redshift survey has been conducted around these sight lines to investigate the warm absorber environment, which is found to be spiral-rich groups or cluster outskirts with radial velocity dispersions σ = 250–750 km s−1. While 2σ evidence is presented favoring the hypothesis that these absorptions are associated with the galaxy groups and not with the individual, nearest galaxies, this evidence has considerable systematic uncertainties and is based on a small sample size so it is not entirely conclusive. If the associations are with galaxy groups, the observed frequency of warm absorbers ( = 3.5–5 per unit redshift) requires them to be very extended as an ensemble on the sky (∼1 Mpc in radius at high covering factor). Most likely these warm absorbers are interface gas clouds whose presence implies the existence of a hotter (T ∼ 106.5 K), diffuse, and probably very massive (>1011 M☉) intra-group medium which has yet to be detected directly.},

These data are well described by simple photoionization models, with the gas highly ionized (nH ii/nH ≳ 99%) by the extragalactic ultraviolet background. Scaling by estimates for the virial radius, Rvir, we show that the ionization state (tracked by the dimensionless ionization parameter, U) increases with distance from the host galaxy. The ionization parameters imply a decreasing volume density profile nH = (10−4.2 ± 0.25)(R/Rvir)−0.8 ± 0.3. Our derived gas volume densities are several orders of magnitude lower than predictions from standard two-phase models with a cool medium in pressure equilibrium with a hot, coronal medium expected in virialized halos at this mass scale. Applying the ionization corrections to the H i column densities, we estimate a lower limit to the cool gas mass  M☉ for the volume within R < Rvir. Allowing for an additional warm-hot, O vi-traced phase, the CGM accounts for at least half of the baryons purported to be missing from dark matter halos at the 1012 M☉ scale.},

The study is based on a sample of $95$ galaxies from a highly complete ($ > 80\%$) survey of faint galaxies ($L > 0.1L_*$) with archival quasar absorption spectra and $53$ galaxies from the literature. A clear anti-correlation is found between HI (OVI) column density and virial radius normalized projected distance, $d/R_{\rm h}$. Strong HI (OVI) absorption systems with column densities greater than $10^{14.0}$ ($10^{13.5}$) cm$^{-2}$ are found for $48$ of $54$ ($36$ of $42$) galaxies at $d R_{\rm h}$ compared to isolated galaxies ($\kappa_{\rm OVI}\approx0.13$ versus $0.04$) but no excess HI absorption. These findings suggest that environmental effects play a role in distributing heavy elements beyond the enriched gaseous halos of individual galaxies. Finally, we find that differential HI and OVI absorption between early- and late-type galaxies continues from $d < R_{\rm h}$ to $d\approx3\,R_{\rm h}$.},

 We present a new set of high-resolution hydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations that apply the Feedback In Realistic Environments physics to both Local Group (LG)-like and isolated Milky Way (MW)-like volumes (10 host systems in total with a baryonic particle mass ${\simeq } 3500\!-\!7000\,{\rm M}_\odot$). We study the stellar mass functions, circular velocity or mass profiles, and velocity dispersions of the dwarf galaxy populations. The simulations reproduce the stellar mass function and central densities of MW satellite dwarfs for $M_\ast \ge 10^{5.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and predict the existence of ∼3 unidentified galaxies with $M_\ast \sim 10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ within 300 kpc of the MW. Overall, we find no evidence for the classical missing satellites or too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problems for satellite galaxies in our sample. Among the satellites, TBTF is resolved primarily by subhalo disruption and overall mass-loss; central density profiles of subhaloes are of secondary importance. For non-satellite galaxies, our LG-like simulations predict as many as ∼10 as-of-yet unseen galaxies at distances $0.3\!-\!1\, \mathrm{Mpc}$ from both hosts, with $M_\ast \simeq 10^{5-6}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ (in haloes with Vmax ∼ 20 km s−1), albeit with large halo-to-halo variance. None of our simulations produces a compact, baryon-dominated, high-density dwarf elliptical-type galaxy (with Vcirc ≳ 35 km s−1 at $r\lt 1\,$ kpc), of which six may appear in the LG (but none in the MW). It may therefore remain a challenge to reproduce the full diversity of the dwarf population, including both the highest and lowest density systems.},

This is done utilizing two different suites of zoom-in hydro-cosmological simulations, VELA (6 halos; $z>1$) and NIHAO (18 halos; to $z=0$), which provide a broad theoretical basis because they use different codes and physical recipes for star formation and feedback. In all halos studied in this work, we find that collisional ionization by thermal electrons dominates at high redshift, while photoionization of cool or warm gas by the metagalactic radiation takes over near $z\sim2$. In halos of $\sim 10^{12}M_{\odot}$ and above, collisions become important again at $z 3\times10^{11}~M_{\odot}$, at $z\sim 0$ most of the photoionized OVI is in a warm, not cool, gas phase ($T\lesssim 3\times 10^5$~K). We also find that collisions are dominant in the central regions of halos, while photoionization is more significant at the outskirts, around $R_{\textrm v}$, even in massive halos.

 abstract = {We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to investigate how inflows, star formation, and outflows govern the the gaseous and metal content of galaxies within a hierarchical structure formation context. In our simulations, galaxy metallicities are established by a balance between inflows and outflows as governed by the mass outflow rate, implying that the mass-metallicity relation reflects how the outflow rate varies with stellar mass. Gas content, meanwhile, is set by a competition between inflow into and gas consumption within the interstellar medium, the latter being governed by the star formation law, while the former is impacted by both wind recycling and preventive feedback. Stochastic variations in the inflow rate move galaxies off the equilibrium mass-metallicity and mass-gas fraction relations in a manner correlated with star formation rate, and the scatter is set by the timescale to re-equilibrate. The evolution of both relations from z = 3 ! 0 is slow, as individual galaxies tend to evolve mostly along the relations. Gas fractions at a given stellar mass slowly decrease with time because the cosmic inflow rate diminishes faster than the consumption rate, while metallicities slowly increase as infalling gas becomes more enriched. Observations from z � 3 ! 0 are better matched by simulations employing momentum-driven wind scalings rather than constant wind speeds, but all models predict too low gas fractions at low masses and too high metallicities at high masses. All our models reproduce observed second-parameter trends of the mass-metallicity relation with star formation rate and environment, indicating that these are a consequence of equilibrium and not feedback. Overall, the analytical framework of our equilibrium scenario broadly captures the relevant physics establishing the galaxy gas and metal content in simulations, which suggests that the cycle of baryonic inflows and outflows centrally governs the cosmic evolution of these properties in typical star-forming galaxies.},

 We investigate the case for environmental quenching of the Fornax-mass satellite DDO 113, which lies only 9 kpc in projection from its host, the Large-Magellanic-Cloud-mass galaxy NGC 4214. DDO 113 was quenched about 1 Gyr ago and is virtually gas-free, while analogs in the field are predominantly star-forming and gas-rich. We use deep imaging obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope to show that DDO 113 exhibits no evidence of tidal disruption to a surface brightness of μV ∼ 29 mag arcsec−2, based on both unresolved emission and resolved stars. Mass-analogs of DDO 113 in Illustris-1 with similar hosts, small projected separations, and no significant tidal stripping first fell into their host halo 2–6 Gyr ago, showing that tidal features (or lack thereof) can be used to constrain infall times in systems where there are few other constraints on the orbit of the satellite. With the infall time setting the clock for environmental quenching mechanisms, we investigate the plausibility of several such mechanisms. We find that strangulation, the cessation of cold gas inflows, is likely the dominant quenching mechanism for DDO 113, requiring a time-averaged mass-loading factor of η = 6–11 for star-formation-driven outflows that is consistent with theoretical and observational constraints. Motivated by recent numerical work, we connect DDO 113’s strangulation to the presence of a cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) around NGC 4214. This discovery shows that the CGM of low-mass galaxies can affect their satellites significantly and motivates further work on understanding the baryon cycle in low-mass galaxies.},

We combine empirically derived star formation histories with updated supernova and asymptotic giant branch yields and rates to estimate the total mass of metals produced by galaxies with present-day stellar mass of 109.3–1011.6 M☉. On the accounting side of the ledger, we show that a surprisingly constant 20%–25% mass fraction of produced metals remain in galaxies' stars, interstellar gas and interstellar dust, with little dependence of this fraction on the galaxy stellar mass (omitting those metals immediately locked up in remnants). Thus, the bulk of metals are outside of galaxies, produced in the progenitors of today's L* galaxies. The COS-Halos survey is uniquely able to measure the mass of metals in the circumgalactic medium (CGM, to impact parameters of <150 kpc) of low-redshift ∼L* galaxies. Using these data, we map the distribution of CGM metals as traced by both the highly ionized O vi ion and a suite of low-ionization species; combined with constraints on circumgalactic dust and hotter X-ray emitting gas out to similar impact parameters, we show that ∼40% of metals produced by M⋆ ∼ 1010 M☉ galaxies can be easily accounted for out to 150 kpc. With the current data, we cannot rule out a constant mass of metals within this fixed physical radius.

 The galaxy size–stellar mass and central surface density–stellar mass relationships are fundamental observational constraints on galaxy formation models. However, inferring the physical size of a galaxy from observed stellar emission is non-trivial due to various observational effects, such as the mass-to-light ratio variations that can be caused by non-uniform stellar ages, metallicities, and dust attenuation. Consequently, forward-modelling light-based sizes from simulations is desirable. In this work, we use the skirt  dust radiative transfer code to generate synthetic observations of massive galaxies ($M_{*}\sim 10^{11}\, \rm {M_{\odot }}$ at z = 2, hosted by haloes of mass $M_{\rm {halo}}\sim 10^{12.5}\, \rm {M_{\odot }}$) from high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations that form part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments project. The simulations used in this paper include explicit stellar feedback but no active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. From each mock observation, we infer the effective radius (Re), as well as the stellar mass surface density within this radius and within $1\, \rm {kpc}$ (Σe and Σ1, respectively). We first investigate how well the intrinsic half-mass radius and stellar mass surface density can be inferred from observables. The majority of predicted sizes and surface densities are within a factor of 2 of the intrinsic values. We then compare our predictions to the observed size–mass relationship and the Σ1−M⋆ and Σe−M⋆ relationships. At z ≳ 2, the simulated massive galaxies are in general agreement with observational scaling relations. At z ≲ 2, they evolve to become too compact but still star forming, in the stellar mass and redshift regime where many of them should be quenched. Our results suggest that some additional source of feedback, such as AGN-driven outflows, is necessary in order to decrease the central densities of the simulated massive galaxies to bring them into agreement with observations at z ≲ 2.},

We use the TNG100 and TNG300 large volume cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. Modeling the ionization states of simulated oxygen, we find good agreement with observations of the low-redshift OVI column density distribution function (CDDF), and present its evolution for all three ions from z=0 to z=4. Producing mock quasar absorption line spectral surveys, we show that the IllustrisTNG simulations are fully consistent with constraints on the OVI content of the CGM from COS-Halos and other low redshift observations, producing columns as high as observed. We measure the total amount of mass and average column densities of each ion using hundreds of thousands of simulated galaxies spanning 10^11 < Mhalo/Msun < 10^15 corresponding to 10^9 < M*/Msun < 10^12 in stellar mass. Stacked radial profiles of OVI are computed in 3D number density and 2D projected column, decomposing into the 1-halo and 2-halo terms. Relating halo OVI to properties of the central galaxy, we find a correlation between the (g-r) color of a galaxy and the total amount of OVI in its CGM. In comparison to the COS-Halos finding, this leads to a dichotomy of columns around star-forming versus passive galaxies at fixed stellar (or halo) mass. We demonstrate that this correlation is a direct result of blackhole feedback associated with quenching and represents a causal consequence of galactic-scale baryonic feedback impacting the physical state of the circumgalactic medium.},

Assuming that this dichotomy is driven by environmental quenching, we use the ELVIS suite of N -body simulations to constrain the characteristic timescale upon which satellites must quench following infall into the virial volumes of their hosts. The high satellite quenched fraction observed in the Local Group demands an extremely short quenching timescale (∼ 2 Gyr) for dwarf satellites in the mass range M ? ∼ 10 6 − 10 8 M . This quenching timescale is significantly shorter than that required to explain the quenched fraction of more massive satellites (∼ 8 Gyr), both in the Local Group and in more massive host halos, suggesting a dramatic change in the dominant satellite quenching mechanism at M ? . 10 8 M . Combining our work with the results of complementary analyses in the literature, we conclude that the suppression of star formation in massive satellites (M ? ∼ 10 8 − 10 11 M ) is broadly consistent with being driven by starvation, such that the satellite quenching timescale corresponds to the cold gas depletion time. Below a critical stellar mass scale of ∼ 10 8 M , however, the required quenching times are much shorter than the expected cold gas depletion times. Instead, quenching must act on a timescale comparable to the dynamical time of the host halo. We posit that ram-pressure stripping can naturally explain this behavior, with the critical mass (of M ? ∼ 10 8 M ) corresponding to halos with gravitational restoring forces that are too weak to overcome the drag force encountered when moving through an extended, hot circumgalactic medium. Key words: Local Group – galaxies: formation – galaxies: evolution – galaxies: dwarf – galaxies: star formation INTRODUCTION Foremost among the results of galaxy surveys over the last decade has been the realization that the galaxy population at z . 2 is bimodal in nature (e.g. Strateva et al. 2001; Baldry et al. 2004; Bell et al. 2004; Cooper et al. 2006). That is, galaxies both locally and out to intermediate red- shift are effectively described as one of two distinct types: red, early-type galaxies lacking significant star formation and blue, late-type galaxies with active star formation. In color-magnitude space, the red galaxies populate a tight re- lation (often called the red sequence), while the distribu- tion of blue galaxies is more scattered (sometimes referred to as the blue cloud). While the red and blue populations ? e-mail: sfilling@uci.edu † e-mail: cooper@uci.edu c 2015 RAS comprise approximately equal portions of the cosmic stellar mass budget at z ∼ 1, galaxies on the red sequence domi- nate today, following a growth in stellar mass within the red population of roughly a factor of 2 over the past 7 Gyr (Bell et al. 2004; Bundy et al. 2006; Faber et al. 2007; Brown et al. 2007). Despite uncertainty regarding the particular physical process(es) at play, the suppression (or quenching) of star formation in blue galaxies, thereby making them red, is one of the principal drivers of this dramatic growth in the num- ber density of quiescent systems at late cosmic time. At both low and intermediate redshift, the local envi- ronment of a galaxy is known to be well-correlated with the suppression of star formation, such that passive or quies- cent galaxies preferentially live in higher-density environ- ments (Balogh et al. 2004; Kauffmann et al. 2004; Blanton et al. 2005; Cooper et al. 2006, 2007, 2010a).

 In several models of galaxy formation feedback occurs in cycles or mainly at high redshift. At times and in regions where feedback heating is ineffective, hot gas in the galaxy halo is expected to form a cooling flow, where the gas advects inward on a cooling timescale. Cooling flow solutions can thus be used as a benchmark for observations and simulations to constrain the timing and extent of feedback heating. Using analytic calculations and idealized 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we show that for a given halo mass and cooling function, steady-state cooling flows form a single-parameter family of solutions, while initially hydrostatic gaseous haloes converge on one of these solutions within a cooling time. The solution is thus fully determined once either the mass inflow rate ${\dot{M}}$ or the total halo gas mass are known. In the Milky Way halo, a cooling flow with ${\dot{M}}$ equal to the star formation rate predicts a ratio of the cooling time to the free-fall time of ∼10, similar to some feedback-regulated models. This solution also correctly predicts observed $\rm{O\,{\small VII}}$ and $\rm{O\,{\small VIII}}$ absorption columns, and the gas density profile implied by $\rm{O\,{\small VII}}$ and $\rm{O\,{\small VIII}}$ emission. These results suggest ongoing heating by feedback may be negligible in the inner Milky-Way halo. Extending similar solutions out to the cooling radius however underpredicts observed $\rm{O\,{\small VI}}$ columns around the Milky-Way and around other low-redshift star-forming galaxies. This can be reconciled with the successes of the cooling flow model with either a mechanism which preferentially heats the $\rm{O\,{\small VI}}$-bearing outer halo, or alternatively if $\rm{O\,{\small VI}}$ traces cool photoionized gas beyond the accretion shock. We also demonstrate that the entropy profiles of some of the most relaxed clusters are reasonably well described by a cooling flow solution.},

 abstract = {We present basic data and modeling for a survey of the cool, photoionized circumgalactic medium (CGM) of low-redshift galaxies using far-UV QSO absorption-line probes. This survey consists of “targeted” and “serendipitous” CGM subsamples, originally described in Stocke et al. (Paper I). The targeted subsample probes low-luminosity, late-type galaxies at z < 0.02 with small impact parameters ( 〈 ρ 〉 = 71 kpc), and the serendipitous subsample probes higher luminosity galaxies at z ≲ 0.2 with larger impact parameters ( 〈 ρ 〉 = 222 kpc). Hubble Space Telescope and FUSE UV spectroscopy of the absorbers and basic data for the associated galaxies, derived from ground-based imaging and spectroscopy, are presented. We find broad agreement with the COS-Halos results, but our sample shows no evidence for changing ionization parameter or hydrogen density with distance from the CGM host galaxy, probably because the COS-Halos survey probes the CGM at smaller impact parameters. We find at least two passive galaxies with H i and metal-line absorption, confirming the intriguing COS-Halos result that galaxies sometimes have cool gas halos despite no on-going star formation. Using a new methodology for fitting H i absorption complexes, we confirm the CGM cool gas mass of Paper I, but this value is significantly smaller than that found by the COS-Halos survey. We trace much of this difference to the specific values of the low-z metagalactic ionization rate assumed. After accounting for this difference, a best-value for the CGM cool gas mass is found by combining the results of both surveys to obtain log ( M / M ⊙ ) = 10.5 ± 0.3 , or ∼30% of the total baryon reservoir of an L ≥ L * , star-forming galaxy.},

Each code implements a distinct set of feedback and star formation prescriptions. We find that while many galaxy and halo properties vary between the different codes (and feedback prescriptions), there is qualitative agreement on the process of angular momentum acquisition in the galaxy’s halo. In all simulations, cold filamentary gas accretion to the halo results in ∼4 times more specific angular momentum in cold halo gas (λcold ≳ 0.1) than in the dark matter halo. At z > 1, this inflow takes the form of inspiraling cold streams that are co-directional in the halo of the galaxy and are fueled, aligned, and kinematically connected to filamentary gas infall along the cosmic web. Due to the qualitative agreement among disparate simulations, we conclude that the buildup of high angular momentum halo gas and the presence of these inspiraling cold streams are robust predictions of Lambda Cold Dark Matter galaxy formation, though the detailed morphology of these streams is significantly less certain. A growing body of observational evidence suggests that this process is borne out in the real universe.},

The sample is comprised of seven idealized simulations, an adaptive mesh refinement cosmological zoom-in simulation, and two groups of 50 halos with star-forming or quiescent galaxies taken from the TNG100 simulation. The simulations have very different setups, resolution, and feedback models, but are analyzed in a uniform manner. By comparing median radial profiles and mass distributions of CGM properties, we isolate key similarities and differences. In doing so, we advance the efforts of the Simulating Multiscale Astrophysics to Understand Galaxies project that aims to understand the inherently multiscale galaxy formation process. In the cosmological simulations, the CGM exhibits nearly flat temperature distributions, and broad pressure and radial velocity distributions. In the idealized simulations, similar distributions are found in the inner CGM ( ) when strong galactic feedback models are employed, but the outer CGM ( ) has a much less prominent cold phase, and narrower pressure and velocity distributions even in models with strong feedback. This comparative analysis demonstrates the dominant role feedback plays in shaping the inner CGM and the increased importance of cosmological effects, such as nonspherical accretion and satellite galaxies, in the outer CGM. Furthermore, our findings highlight that, while cosmological simulations are required to capture the multiphase structure of the CGM at large radii, idealized simulations provide a robust framework to study how galactic feedback interacts with the inner CGM, and thereby provide a reliable avenue to constrain feedback prescriptions.},

 abstract = {Hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE), where the thermal pressure gradient balances the force of gravity, is tested across a range of simulated EAGLE haloes from Milky Way L* haloes (M_200~10^12 Msol) to cluster scales. Clusters (M_200>=10^14 Msol) reproduce previous results with thermal pressure responsible for ~90% of the support against gravity, but this fraction drops for group-sized haloes (M_200~10^13 Msol) and is even lower (40-70%) for L* haloes between 0.1-0.3 R_200. Energy from feedback grows relative to the binding energy of a halo toward lower mass resulting in greater deviations from HSE. Tangential motions comprise the largest deviation from HSE in L* haloes indicating that the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) has significant sub- centrifugal rotation and angular momentum spin parameters 2-3x higher than the dark matter spin parameters. Thermal feedback can buoyantly rise to the outer CGM of M_200<10^12 Msol haloes, both moving baryons beyond R_200 and feeding uncorrelated tangential motions. The resulting hot halo density and rotation profiles show promising agreement with X-ray observations of the inner Milky Way halo, and we discuss future observational prospects to detect spinning hot haloes around other galaxies. Acceleration and radial streaming motions also comprise significant deviations from HSE, especially net outward accelerations seen in L* and group haloes indicating active feedback. Black hole feedback acts in a preventative manner during the later growth of group haloes, applying significant accelerations via shocks that do not feed tangential motions. We argue that HSE is a poor assumption for the CGM, especially in the inner regions, and rotating baryonic hot haloes are a critical consideration for analytic models of the CGM.},

 abstract = {We use cosmological simulations from the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments) project to study the baryon cycle and galaxy mass assembly for central galaxies in the halo mass range Mhalo ∼ 10^(10)–10^(13) M_⊙. By tracing cosmic inflows, galactic outflows, gas recycling and merger histories, we quantify the contribution of physically distinct sources of material to galaxy growth. We show that in situ star formation fuelled by fresh accretion dominates the early growth of galaxies of all masses, while the re-accretion of gas previously ejected in galactic winds often dominates the gas supply for a large portion of every galaxy’s evolution. Externally processed material contributes increasingly to the growth of central galaxies at lower redshifts. This includes stars formed ex situ and gas delivered by mergers, as well as smooth intergalactic transfer of gas from other galaxies, an important but previously underappreciated growth mode. By z = 0, wind transfer, i.e. the exchange of gas between galaxies via winds, can dominate gas accretion on to ∼L* galaxies over fresh accretion and standard wind recycling. Galaxies of all masses re-accrete ≳50 per cent of the gas ejected in winds and recurrent recycling is common. The total mass deposited in the intergalactic medium per unit stellar mass formed increases in lower mass galaxies. Re-accretion of wind ejecta occurs over a broad range of time-scales, with median recycling times (∼100–350 Myr) shorter than previously found. Wind recycling typically occurs at the scale radius of the halo, independent of halo mass and redshift, suggesting a characteristic recycling zone around galaxies that scales with the size of the inner halo and the galaxy’s stellar component.},

Combining far-ultraviolet Cosmic Origin Spectrograph spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope and optical echelle spectra from the ground enables a detailed ionization analysis based on resolved component structures of a suite of absorption transitions, including the full HI Lyman series and various ionic metal transitions. By comparing the relative abundances of different ions in individually-matched components, we show that cool gas (T~1e4 K) density and metallicity can vary by more than a factor of ten in in an LRG halo. Specifically, metal-poor absorbing components with <1/10 solar metallicity are seen in 50% of the LRG halos, while gas with solar and super-solar metallicity is also common. These results indicate a complex multiphase structure and poor chemical mixing in these quiescent halos. We calculate the total surface mass density of cool gas, \Sigma_cool, by applying the estimated ionization fraction corrections to the observed HI column densities. The radial profile of \Sigma_cool is best-described by a projected Einasto profile of slope \alpha=1 and scale radius r_s=48 kpc. We find that typical LRGs at z~0.4 contain cool gas mass of M_cool= (1-2) x1e10 M_sun at d<160 kpc (or as much as 4x1e10 M_sun at d<500 kpc), comparable to the cool CGM mass of star-forming galaxies. Furthermore, we show that high-ionization OVI and low-ionization absorption species exhibit distinct velocity profiles, highlighting their different physical origins. We discuss the implications of our findings for the origin and fate of cool gas in LRG halos.},

The thermal properties at small radii are regulated by feedback triggered when $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}\lesssim10$ in the hot gas. Below M$_{\rm crit}$, however, there is no thermally supported halo and self-regulation at $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}\sim10$ does not apply. Instead, the gas is out of hydrostatic equilibrium and largely supported against gravity by bulk flows (turbulence and coherent inflow/outflow) arising from the interaction between cosmological gas inflow and outflowing galactic winds. In these lower mass haloes, the phase structure depends sensitively on the outflows' energy per unit mass and mass-loading, which may allow measurements of the CGM thermal state to constrain the nature of galactic winds. Our simulations account for some of the properties of the multiphase halo gas inferred from quasar absorption line observations, including the presence of significant mass at a wide range of temperatures, and the characteristic OVI and CIV column densities and kinematics. However, we underpredict the neutral hydrogen content of the $z\sim0$ CGM.},

 We present the design, methods, and first results of the MUSE Analysis of Gas around Galaxies (MAGG) survey, a large programme on the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), which targets 28 z > 3.2 quasars to investigate the connection between optically thick gas and galaxies at z ∼ 3–4. MAGG maps the environment of 52 strong absorption line systems at z ≳ 3, providing the first statistical sample of galaxies associated with gas-rich structures in the early Universe. In this paper, we study the galaxy population around a very metal poor gas cloud at z ≈ 3.53 towards the quasar J124957.23−015928.8. We detect three Lyα emitters within $\lesssim 200~\rm km~s^{-1}$ of the cloud redshift, at projected separations $\lesssim 185~\rm ~kpc$ (physical). The presence of star-forming galaxies near a very metal-poor cloud indicates that metal enrichment is still spatially inhomogeneous at this redshift. Based on its very low metallicity and the presence of nearby galaxies, we propose that the most likely scenario for this Lyman Limit System (LLS) is that it lies within a filament which may be accreting on to a nearby galaxy. Taken together with the small number of other LLSs studied with MUSE, the observations to date show a range of different environments near strong absorption systems. The full MAGG survey will significantly expand this sample and enable a statistical analysis of the link between gas and galaxies to pin down the origin of these diverse environments at z ≈ 3–4.},

 abstract = {The hot (>106 K) phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) contains a large fraction of baryons in galaxies. It also retains signatures of the processes that shaped the galaxies, such as feedback from active galactic nuclei and supernovae, and offers a uniquely powerful way to constrain theoretical models of feedback. It is, however, notoriously difficult to detect. By stacking 2643 optically selected galaxies in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey, we present spatially resolved properties of the extended CGM in both star-forming and quiescent galaxies spanning an order of magnitude in stellar mass. We mask out resolved point sources and galaxy groups/clusters and model the contribution from X-ray binaries and the hot interstellar medium, producing accurate radial profiles. We compare the profiles to mock X-ray observations of galaxy stacks in the IllustrisTNG100 and EAGLE cosmological simulations. We detect extended emission from both the high-mass ( 10.7<log(M*/M⊙)<11.2 ) and low-mass ( 10.2<log(M*/M⊙)<10.7 ) galaxy stacks. Galaxies have somewhat more luminous CGM between 10 and 100 kpc if they are more massive or star-forming. However, the luminosity increases more slowly with stellar mass than predicted in simulations. Simulated quenched galaxies are dimmer than observed, suggesting that they rely too heavily on CGM ejection for quenching. Star-forming galaxies are observed to have flatter and more extended profiles than in simulations, suggesting underefficient stellar feedback models. Our results highlight the need to modify future prescriptions of galaxy feedback models.},

In order to constrain the nature of the gas traced by , we analyze additional observables of the outer halo, namely to O vi column ratios of 1–10, an absence of low-ion absorption, a mean differential extinction of , and a linear relation between the O vi column and the O VI velocity width. We contrast these observations with two physical scenarios: (1) O vi traces high-pressure ( ) collisionally ionized gas cooling from a virially shocked phase, and (2) O vi traces low-pressure ( ) gas beyond the accretion shock, where the gas is in ionization and thermal equilibrium with the UV background. We demonstrate that the high-pressure scenario requires multiple gas phases to explain the observations and a large deposition of energy at to offset the energy radiated by the cooling gas. In contrast, the low-pressure scenario can explain all considered observations with a single gas phase in thermal equilibrium, provided that the baryon overdensity is comparable to the dark-matter overdensity and that the gas is enriched to with an ISM-like dust-to-metal ratio. The low-pressure scenario implies that O vi traces a cool flow with a mass flow rate of , comparable to the star formation rate of the central galaxies. The O vi line widths are consistent with the velocity shear expected within this flow. The low-pressure scenario predicts a bimodality in absorption line ratios at , due to the pressure jump across the accretion shock.},

 abstract = {Observed galactic disks have specific angular momenta similar to expectations for typical dark matter halos in ΛCDM. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have recently reproduced this similarity in large galaxy samples by including strong galactic winds, but the exact mechanism that achieves this is not yet clear. Here we present an analysis of key aspects contributing to this relation: angular momentum selection and evolution of Lagrangian mass elements as they accrete onto dark matter halos, condense into Milky-Way-scale galaxies, and join the z = 0 stellar phase. We contrast this evolution in the Illustris simulation with that in a simulation without galactic winds, where the z = 0 angular momentum is lower. We find that winds induce differences between these simulations in several ways: increasing angular momentum, preventing angular momentum loss, and causing z = 0 stars to sample the accretion-time angular momentum distribution of baryons in a biased way. In both simulations, gas loses on average between accreting onto halos and first accreting onto central galaxies. In Illustris, this is followed by gains in the “galactic wind fountain” and no further net evolution past the final accretion onto the galaxy. Without feedback, further losses of occur in the gas phase inside the galaxies. An additional difference arises from feedback preferentially selecting higher angular momentum gas at accretion by expelling gas that is poorly aligned. These and additional effects of similar magnitude are discussed, suggesting a complex origin of the similarity between the specific angular momenta of galactic disks and typical halos.},

 abstract = {We use the SDSS/DR8 galaxy sample to study the radial distribution of satellite galaxies around isolated primaries, comparing to semi-analytic models of galaxy formation based on the Millennium and Millennium-II simulations. SDSS satellites behave differently around high- and low-mass primaries: those orbiting objects with M∗ > 10 11 M⊙ are mostly red and are less concentrated towards their host than the inferred dark matter halo, an effect that is very pronounced for the few blue satellites. On the other hand, less massive primaries have steeper satellite profiles that agree quite well with the expected dark matter distribution and are dominated by blue satellites, even in the inner regions where strong environmental effects are expected. In fact, such effects appear to be strong only for primaries with M∗ > 10 11 M⊙. This behaviour is not reproduced by current semi-analytic simulations, where satellite profiles always parallel those of the dark matter and satellite populations are predominantly red for primaries of all masses. The disagreement with SDSS suggests that environmental effects are too efficient in the models. Modifying the treatment of environmental and star formation processes can substantially increase the fraction of blue satellites, but their radial distribution remains significantly shallower than observed. It seems that most satellites of low-mass primaries can continue to form stars even after orbiting within their joint halo for 5 Gyr or more.},

 abstract = {We use high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations with ∼200 pc resolution at z = 2 and various prescriptions for galactic outflows in order to explore the impact of winds on the morphological, dynamical, and structural properties of eight individual galaxies with halo masses ∼1011–2 × 1012 M☉ at z = 2. We present a detailed comparison to spatially and spectrally resolved Hα and other observations of z ≈ 2 galaxies. We find that simulations without winds produce massive, compact galaxies with low gas fractions, super-solar metallicities, high bulge fractions, and much of the star formation concentrated within the inner kiloparsec. Strong winds are required to maintain high gas fractions, redistribute star-forming gas over larger scales, and increase the velocity dispersion of simulated galaxies, more in agreement with the large, extended, turbulent disks typical of high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Winds also suppress early star formation to produce high-redshift cosmic star formation efficiencies in better agreement with observations. Sizes, rotation velocities, and velocity dispersions all scale with stellar mass in accord with observations. Our simulations produce a diversity of morphological characteristics—among our three most massive galaxies, we find a quiescent grand-design spiral, a very compact star-forming galaxy, and a clumpy disk undergoing a minor merger; the clumps are evident in Hα but not in the stars. Rotation curves are generally slowly rising, particularly when calculated using azimuthal velocities rather than enclosed mass. Our results are broadly resolution-converged. These results show that cosmological simulations including outflows can produce disk galaxies similar to those observed during the peak epoch of cosmic galaxy growth.},

 abstract = {We present a novel analytic framework to model the steady-state structure of multiphase galactic winds comprised of a hot, volume-filling component and a cold, clumpy component. We first derive general expressions for the structure of the hot phase for arbitrary mass, momentum, and energy source terms. Next, informed by recent simulations, we parameterize the cloud–wind mass transfer rates, which are set by the competition between turbulent mixing and radiative cooling. This enables us to cast the cloud–wind interaction as a source term for the hot phase and thereby simultaneously solve for the evolution of both phases, fully accounting for their bidirectional influence. With this model, we explore the nature of galactic winds over a broad range of conditions. We find that (i) with realistic parameter choices, we naturally produce a hot, low-density wind that transports energy while entraining a significant flux of cold clouds, (ii) mixing dominates the cold cloud acceleration and decelerates the hot wind, (iii) during mixing thermalization of relative kinetic energy provides significant heating, (iv) systems with low hot phase mass loading factors and/or star formation rates can sustain higher initial cold phase mass loading factors, but the clouds are quickly shredded, and (v) systems with large hot phase mass loading factors and/or high star formation rates cannot sustain large initial cold phase mass loading factors, but the clouds tend to grow with distance from the galaxy.

 abstract = {We present results from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS), a unique spectroscopic survey of the distant universe designed to explore the details of the connection between galaxies and intergalactic baryons within the same survey volumes, focusing particularly on scales from ∼50 kpc to a few Mpc. The KBSS is optimized for the redshift range z ∼ 2–3, combining S/N ∼100 Keck/HIRES spectra of 15 of the brightest QSOs in the sky at z ≃ 2.5–2.9 with very densely sampled galaxy redshift surveys within a few arcmin of each QSO sightline. In this paper, we present quantitative results on the distribution, column density, kinematics, and absorber line widths of neutral hydrogen (H i) surrounding a subset of 886 KBSS star-forming galaxies with 2.0 ≲ z ≲ 2.8 and with projected distances ⩽3 physical Mpc from a QSO sightline. Using Voigt profile decompositions of the full Lyα forest region of all 15 QSO spectra, we compiled a catalog of ∼6000 individual absorbers in the redshift range of interest, with 12 ⩽ log (NH i) ⩽21. These are used to measure H i absorption statistics near the redshifts of foreground galaxies as a function of projected galactocentric distance from the QSO sightline and for randomly chosen locations in the intergalactic medium (IGM) within the survey volume. We find that NH i and the multiplicity of velocity-associated H i components increase rapidly with decreasing galactocentric impact parameter and as the systemic redshift of the galaxy is approached. The strongest H i absorbers within ≃ 100 physical kpc of galaxies have NH i ∼3 orders of magnitude higher than those near random locations in the IGM. The circumgalactic zone of most significantly enhanced H i absorption is found within transverse distances of ≲ 300 kpc and within ±300 km s−1 of galaxy systemic redshifts. Taking this region as the defining bounds of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), nearly half of absorbers with log(NH i) > 15.5 are found within the CGM of galaxies meeting our photometric selection criteria, while their CGM occupy only 1.5% of the cosmic volume. The spatial covering fraction, multiplicity of absorption components, and characteristic NH i remain significantly elevated to transverse distances of ∼2 physical Mpc from galaxies in our sample. Absorbers with NH i >1014.5 cm−2 are tightly correlated with the positions of galaxies, while absorbers with lower NH i are correlated with galaxy positions only on ≳Mpc scales. Redshift anisotropies on these larger scales indicate coherent infall toward galaxy locations, while on scales of ∼100 physical kpc peculiar velocities of Δv ≃ ±260 km s−1 with respect to the galaxies are indicated. The median Doppler widths of individual absorbers within 1–3 rvir of galaxies are larger by ≃ 50% than randomly chosen absorbers of the same NH i, suggesting higher gas temperatures and/or increased turbulence likely caused by some combination of accretion shocks and galactic winds around galaxies with Mhalo ≃ 1012 M☉ at z ∼ 2–3.},

 abstract = {(Abridged) This paper presents an absorption-line study of the multiphase circumgalactic medium (CGM) based on observations of Lya, CII, CIV, SiII, SiIII, and SiIV absorption transitions in the vicinities of 195 galaxies at redshift z =0.041, a median projected distance of =362 kpc to the sightline of the background QSO, and a median stellar mass of log(M_star/M_sun) = 9.7 \pm 1.1. Comparing the absorber features identified in the QSO apectra with known galaxy properties has led to strong constraints for the CGM absorption properties at z ~0.7 Rh from either low-mass dwarfs or high-mass galaxies. The lack of detected heavy elements in low- and high-ionization states suggests that either there exists a chemical enrichment edge at d~0.7 Rh or gaseous clumps giving rise to the observed absorption lines cannot survive at these large distances. Considering all galaxies at d>Rh leads to a strict upper limit for the covering fraction of heavy elements of ~3% (at a 95% confidence level) over d=(1-9) Rh. At d<Rh, differential covering fraction between low- and high-ionization gas is observed, suggesting that the CGM becomes progressively more ionized from d<0.3 Rh to larger distances. Comparing CGM absorption observations at low and high redshifts shows that at a fixed-fraction of Rh the CGM exhibits stronger mean absorption at z=2.2 than at z~0. We discuss possible pseudo-evolution of the CGM as a result of misrepresentation of halo radius.},

 abstract = {We compare the properties of galaxies that form in a cosmological simulation without strong feedback to observations of the z = 0 galaxy population. We confirm previous findings that models without strong feedback overproduce the observed galaxy baryonic mass function, especially at the low- and high-mass extremes. Through post-processing we investigate what kinds of feedback would be required to reproduce the statistics of observed galaxy masses and star formation rates. To mimic an extreme form of ‘preventive’ feedback, such as a highly efficient active galactic nucleus ‘radio mode’, we remove all baryonic mass that was originally accreted from shock-heated gas (‘hot-mode’ accretion). This removal does not bring the highmass end of the galaxy mass function into agreement with observations because much of the stellar mass in these systems formed at high redshift from baryons that originally accreted via ‘cold mode’ on to lower mass progenitors. An efficient ‘ejective’ feedback mechanism, such as supernova-driven galactic winds, must reduce the masses of these progenitors before they merge to form today’s massive galaxies. Feedback must also reduce the masses of lower mass z = 0 galaxies, which assemble at lower redshifts and have much lower star formation rates. If we monotonically remap galaxy masses to reproduce the observed mass function, but retain the simulation-predicted star formation rates, we obtain fairly good agreement with the observed sequence of star-forming galaxies. However, we fail to recover the observed population of passive, low star formation rate galaxies, especially at the high-mass end. Suppressing all hotmode accretion improves the agreement for high-mass galaxies, but it worsens the agreement at intermediate masses. Reproducing these z = 0 observations requires a feedback mechanism that dramatically suppresses star formation in a fraction of galaxies, increasing with mass, while leaving star formation rates of other galaxies essentially unchanged.},

The spatial bifurcation of the stream is readily apparent in the HIPASS data, and the kinematical bifurcation is also tentatively identified. This bifurcation provides strong support for the tidal disruption origin for the Magellanic stream. A fiducial model for the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) is presented upon completion of an extensive parameter survey of the potential orbital configurations of the MCs and the viable initial boundary conditions for the disc of the SMC.

To solve the equations of motion of the gas component, we use the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method. Modeling of collisionless components is based on the N-body model. The computations of gravitational forces are carried out using both the approximate hierarchical TreeCode algorithm and the direct method of summing the gravitational contribution from all particles, which provides an accurate solution. This approach allows testing various models and evaluating the resulting errors associated with the calculation of gravitational forces and a finite number of particles in each of the components.

 abstract = {We present a systematic investigation of physical conditions and elemental abundances in four optically thick Lyman-limit systems (LLSs) at z = 0.36 − 0.6 discovered within the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS). Because intervening LLSs at z < 1 suppress FUV light from background QSOs, an unbiased search of these absorbers requires a NUV-selected QSO sample, as achieved by CUBS. CUBS LLSs exhibit multi-component kinematic structure and a complex mix of multiphase gas, with associated metal transitions from multiple ionization states such as C II, C III, N iii, Mg II, Si II, Si III, O ii, O iii, O VI, and Fe ii absorption that span several hundred km s−1 in line-ofsight velocity. Specifically, higher column density components (logN(HI)/cm−2& 16) in all four absorbers comprise dynamically cool gas with 〈T 〉 = (2 ± 1) × 10 K and modest non-thermal broadening of 〈bnt〉 = 5 ± 3 km s−1. The high quality of the QSO absorption spectra allows us to infer the physical conditions of the gas, using a detailed ionization modeling that takes into account the resolved component structures of H i and metal transitions. The range of inferred gas densities indicates that these absorbers consist of spatially compact clouds with a median lineof-sight thickness of 160 −50 pc. While obtaining robust metallicity constraints for the low-density, highly ionized phase remains challenging due to the uncertain N(H i), we demonstrate that the cool-phase gas in LLSs has a median metallicity of [α/H]1/2 = −0.7 −0.2, with a 16-84 percentile range of [α/H] = (−1.3,−0.1). Furthermore, the wide range of inferred elemental abundance ratios ([C/α], [N/α], and [Fe/α]) indicate a diversity of chemical enrichment histories. Combining the absorption data with deep galaxy survey data characterizing the galaxy environment of these absorbers, we discuss the physical connection between star-forming regions in galaxies and diffuse gas associated with optically thick absorption systems in the z < 1 circumgalactic medium.},

 abstract = {We report on the host association of FRB 20181030A, a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) with a low dispersion measure (103.5 pc cm−3) discovered by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. Using baseband voltage data saved for its repeat bursts, we localize the FRB to a sky area of 5.3 arcmin2 (90% confidence). Within the FRB localization region, we identify NGC 3252 as the most promising host with an estimated chance-coincidence probability <2.5 × 10−3. Moreover, we do not find any other galaxy with M r < −15 AB mag within the localization region to the maximum estimated FRB redshift of 0.05. This rules out a dwarf host 5 times less luminous than any FRB host discovered to date. NGC 3252 is a star-forming spiral galaxy and at a distance of ≈20 Mpc, it is one of the closest FRB hosts discovered thus far. From our archival radio data search, we estimate a 3σ upper limit on the luminosity of a persistent compact radio source (source size < 0.3 kpc at 20 Mpc) at 3 GHz to be 2 × 1026 erg s−1 Hz−1, at least 1500 times smaller than that of the FRB 20121102A persistent radio source. We also argue that a population of young millisecond magnetars alone cannot explain the observed volumetric rate of repeating FRBs. Finally, FRB 20181030A is a promising source for constraining FRB emission models due to its proximity and we strongly encourage its multi-wavelength follow-up.},

 abstract = {We use high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to study the angular momentum acquisition of gaseous halos around Milky-Way-sized galaxies. We find that cold mode accreted gas enters a galaxy halo with ∼70% more specific angular momentum than dark matter averaged over cosmic time (though with a very large dispersion). In fact, we find that all matter has a higher spin parameter when measured at accretion than when averaged over the entire halo lifetime, and is well characterized by λ ∼ 0.1, at accretion. Combined with the fact that cold flow gas spends a relatively short time (1–2 dynamical times) in the halo before sinking to the center, this naturally explains why cold flow halo gas has a specific angular momentum much higher than that of the halo and often forms “cold flow disks.” We demonstrate that the higher angular momentum of cold flow gas is related to the fact that it tends to be accreted along filaments.},

We make use of the halo-based group catalogue of Yang and collaborators, which is based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Data from the Galaxy evolution explorer are also used to extract the recent star formation rate. In order to investigate the environmental effects, we examine the properties of 'central' and 'satellite' galaxies separately. For central galaxies, we are unable to conclude whether star formation quenching is primarily connected with halo mass or stellar mass, because these two quantities are themselves strongly correlated. For satellite galaxies, a nearly equally strong dependence on halo mass and stellar mass is seen. We make the same comparison for five different semi-analytic models based on three independently developed codes. We find that the models with active galactic nuclei feedback reproduce reasonably well the dependence of the fraction of central red and passive galaxies on halo mass and stellar mass. However, for satellite galaxies, the same models badly overproduce the fraction of red/passive galaxies and do not reproduce the empirical trends with stellar mass or halo mass. This satellite overquenching problem is caused by the too-rapid stripping of the satellites' hot gas haloes, which leads to rapid strangulation of star formation.},

 abstract = {We present an analysis of the galaxy-scale gaseous outflows from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. This suite of hydrodynamic cosmological zoom simulations resolves formation of star-forming giant molecular clouds to z = 0, and features an explicit stellar feedback model on small scales. Our simulations reveal that high-redshift galaxies undergo bursts of star formation followed by powerful gusts of galactic outflows that eject much of the interstellar medium and temporarily suppress star formation. At low redshift, however, sufficiently massive galaxies corresponding to L* progenitors develop stable discs and switch into a continuous and quiescent mode of star formation that does not drive outflows far into the halo. Mass-loading factors for winds in L* progenitors are η ≈ 10 at high redshift, but decrease to η ≪ 1 at low redshift. Although lower values of η are expected as haloes grow in mass over time, we show that the strong suppression of outflows with decreasing redshift cannot be explained by mass evolution alone. Circumgalactic outflow velocities are variable and broadly distributed, but typically range between one and three times the circular velocity of the halo. Much of the ejected material builds a reservoir of enriched gas within the circumgalactic medium, some of which could be later recycled to fuel further star formation. However, a fraction of the gas that leaves the virial radius through galactic winds is never regained, causing most haloes with mass M_h ≤ 10^(12) M_⊙ to be deficient in baryons compared to the cosmic mean by z = 0.},

 We study star formation histories (SFHs) of 500 dwarf galaxies (stellar mass $M_\ast =10^5\!-\!10^9\, \rm {M}_\odot$) from FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations. We compare dwarfs around individual Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies, dwarfs in Local Group (LG)-like environments, and true field (i.e. isolated) dwarf galaxies. We reproduce observed trends wherein higher mass dwarfs quench later (if at all), regardless of environment. We also identify differences between the environments, both in terms of ‘satellite versus central’ and ‘LG versus individual MW versus isolated dwarf central.’ Around the individual MW-mass hosts, we recover the result expected from environmental quenching: central galaxies in the ‘near field’ have more extended SFHs than their satellite counterparts, with the former more closely resemble isolated (true field) dwarfs (though near-field centrals are still somewhat earlier forming). However, this difference is muted in the LG-like environments, where both near-field centrals and satellites have similar SFHs, which resemble satellites of single MW-mass hosts. This distinction is strongest for M* = 106–$10^7\, \rm {M}_\odot$ but exists at other masses. Our results suggest that the paired halo nature of the LG may regulate star formation in dwarf galaxies even beyond the virial radii of the MW and Andromeda. Caution is needed when comparing zoom-in simulations targeting isolated dwarf galaxies against observed dwarf galaxies in the LG.},

Our CR treatment includes injection by supernovae, anisotropic streaming and diffusion along magnetic field lines, collisional and streaming losses, with constant parallel diffusivity $\kappa\sim3\times10^{29}\,\mathrm{cm^2\ s^{-1}}$ chosen to match $\gamma$-ray observations. With this, CRs become more important at larger halo masses and lower redshifts, and dominate the pressure in the CGM in MW-mass halos at $z\lesssim 1-2$. The gas in these ``CR-dominated'' halos differs significantly from runs without CRs: the gas is primarily cool (a few $\sim10^{4}\,$K), and the cool phase is volume-filling and has a thermal pressure below that needed for virial or local thermal pressure balance. Ionization of the ``low'' and ``mid'' ions in this diffuse cool gas is dominated by photo-ionization, with O VI columns $\gtrsim 10^{14.5}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ at distances $\gtrsim 150\,\mathrm{kpc}$. CR and thermal gas pressure are locally anti-correlated, maintaining total pressure balance, and the CGM gas density profile is determined by the balance of CR pressure gradients and gravity.

 abstract = {We report a bimodality in the azimuthal angle distribution of gas around galaxies as traced by Mg ii absorption: halo gas prefers to exist near the projected galaxy major and minor axes. The bimodality is demonstrated by computing the mean azimuthal angle probability distribution function using 88 spectroscopically confirmed Mg ii-absorption-selected galaxies [Wr(2796) ⩾ 0.1 Å] and 35 spectroscopically confirmed non-absorbing galaxies [Wr(2796) < 0.1 Å] imaged with Hubble Space Telescope and Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The azimuthal angle distribution for non-absorbers is flat, indicating no azimuthal preference for gas characterized by Wr(2796) < 0.1 Å. We find that blue star-forming galaxies clearly drive the bimodality while red passive galaxies may exhibit an excess along their major axis. These results are consistent with galaxy evolution scenarios where star-forming galaxies accrete new gas, forming new stars and producing winds, while red galaxies exist passively due to reduced gas reservoirs. We further compute an azimuthal angle dependent Mg ii absorption covering fraction, which is enhanced by as much as 20%–30% along the major and minor axes. The Wr(2796) distribution for gas along the major axis is likely skewed toward weaker Mg ii absorption than for gas along the projected minor axis. These combined results are highly suggestive that the bimodality is driven by gas accreted along the galaxy major axis and outflowing along the galaxy minor axis. Adopting these assumptions, we find that the opening angle of outflows and inflows to be 100° and 40°, respectively. We find that the probability of detecting outflows is ∼60%, implying that winds are more commonly observed.},

We find the radial scale length of the distributions of the equivalent widths of the Lyα and Si iii absorbers to be ∼1 and ∼0.4 Rvir, respectively. The radial distribution of equivalent widths is relatively uniform for the blue galaxies, but highly patchy (i.e., it has a low covering fraction) for the red galaxies. We also find that the Lyα and Si iii equivalent widths show significant positive correlations with the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of the galaxy. We find a surprising lack of correlations between the halo mass (virial velocity) and either the velocity dispersions or velocity offsets of the Lyα lines. The ratio of the velocity offset to the velocity dispersion for the Lyα absorbers has a mean value of ∼4, suggesting that a given line of sight is intersecting a dynamically coherent structure in the CGM, rather than a sea of orbiting clouds. The kinematic properties of the CGM are similar in the blue and red galaxies, although we find that a significantly larger fraction of the blue galaxies have large Lyα velocity offsets (>200 km s−1). We show that—if the CGM clouds represent future fuel for star formation—our new results could imply a large drop in the sSFR across the galaxy mass-range we probe.},

In the current cosmological model, only the three lightest elements were created in the first few minutes after the Big Bang; all other elements were produced later in stars. To date, however, heavy elements have been observed in all astrophysical environments. We report the detection of two gas clouds with no discernible elements heavier than hydrogen. These systems exhibit the lowest heavy-element abundance in the early universe, and thus are potential fuel for the most metal-poor halo stars. The detection of deuterium in one system at the level predicted by primordial nucleosynthesis provides a direct confirmation of the standard cosmological model. The composition of these clouds further implies that the transport of heavy elements from galaxies to their surroundings is highly inhomogeneous.},

 We revisit the question of ‘hot mode’ versus ‘cold mode’ accretion on to galaxies using steady-state cooling flow solutions and idealized 3D hydrodynamic simulations. We demonstrate that for the hot accretion mode to exist, the cooling time is required to be longer than the free-fall time near the radius where the gas is rotationally supported, Rcirc, i.e. the existence of the hot mode depends on physical conditions at the galaxy scale rather than on physical conditions at the halo scale. When allowing for the depletion of the halo baryon fraction relative to the cosmic mean, the longer cooling times imply that a virialized gaseous halo may form in halo masses below the threshold of $\sim 10^{12}\, {\rm M_{\odot }}$ derived for baryon-complete haloes. We show that for any halo mass there is a maximum accretion rate for which the gas is virialized throughout the halo and can accrete via the hot mode of ${\dot{M}}_{\rm crit}\approx 0.7(v_{\rm c}/100\, \rm km\ s^{-1})^{5.4}(R_{\rm circ}/10\, {\rm kpc})(Z/\, {\rm Z_{\odot }})^{-0.9}\, {\rm M_{\odot }}\, {\rm yr}^{-1}$, where Z and vc are the metallicity and circular velocity measured at Rcirc. For accretion rates $\gtrsim {\dot{M}}_{\rm crit}$ the volume-filling gas phase can in principle be ‘transonic’ – virialized in the outer halo but cool and free-falling near the galaxy. We compare ${\dot{M}}_{\rm crit}$ to the average star formation rate (SFR) in haloes at 0 < z < 10 implied by the stellar-mass–halo-mass relation. For a plausible metallicity evolution with redshift, we find that ${\rm SFR}\lesssim {\dot{M}}_{\rm crit}$ at most masses and redshifts, suggesting that the SFR of galaxies could be primarily sustained by the hot mode in halo masses well below the classic threshold of $\sim 10^{12}\, {\rm M_{\odot }}$.},

We use the SAM to generate a sample of galaxies with halo masses similar to the Milky Way (MW) halo, M vir ≈ 1012 M ⊙, and find that the CGM mass and mean metallicity in the sample are correlated. We use the CGM masses and metallicities of the SAM galaxies as inputs for the FSM20 model and vary the amount of nonthermal support. The density profiles in our models can be approximated by power-law functions with slopes in the range of 0.75 < a n < 1.25, with higher nonthermal pressure resulting in flatter distributions. We explore how the gas pressure, dispersion measure, O VI–O VIII column densities, and cooling rates behave with the gas distribution and total mass. We show that for CGM masses below ∼3 × 1010 M ⊙ photoionization has a significant effect on the column densities of O VI and O VIII. The combination of different MW CGM observations favors models with similar fractions in thermal pressure, magnetic fields/cosmic rays, and turbulent support and with M CGM ∼ (3–10) × 1010 M ⊙. The MW O VI column requires t cool/t dyn ∼ 4, independent of the gas distribution. The AGN jet-driven heating rates in the SAM are enough to offset the CGM cooling, although exact balance is not required in star-forming galaxies. We provide predictions for the column densities of additional metal ions—N V, Ne VIII, and Mg X.},

 abstract = {Supernova driven winds are often invoked to remove chemically enriched gas from dwarf galaxies to match their low observed metallicities. In such shallow potential wells, outflows may produce massive amounts of enriched halo gas (circumgalactic medium, CGM) and pollute the intergalactic medium (IGM). Here, we present a survey of the CGM and IGM around 18 star-forming field dwarfs with stellar masses of at . Eight of these have CGM probed by quasar absorption spectra at projected distances, d, less than that of the host virial radius, . Ten are probed in the surrounding IGM at . The absorption measurements include neutral hydrogen, the dominant silicon ions for diffuse cool gas (T ∼ 104 K; Si ii, Si iii, and Si iv), moderately ionized carbon (C iv), and highly ionized oxygen (O vi). Metal absorption from the CGM of the dwarfs is less common and weaker compared to massive star-forming galaxies, though O vi absorption is still common. None of the dwarfs probed at have definitive metal-line detections. Combining the available silicon ions, we estimate that the cool CGM of the dwarfs accounts for only 2%–6% of the expected silicon budget from the yields of supernovae associated with past star formation. The highly ionized O vi accounts for ≈8% of the oxygen budget. As O vi traces an ion with expected equilibrium ion fractions of ≲0.2, the highly ionized CGM may represent a significant metal reservoir even for dwarfs not expected to maintain gravitationally shock heated hot halos.},

 abstract = {The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is one of the remaining least constrained components of galaxies and as such has significant potential for advancing galaxy formation theories. In this work, we vary the extragalactic ultraviolet background for a high-resolution cosmological simulation of a Milky-Way-like galaxy and examine the effect on the absorption and emission properties of metals in the CGM. We find that a reduced quasar background brings the column density predictions into better agreement with recent data. Similarly, when the observationally derived physical properties of the gas are compared to the simulation, we find that the simulation gas is always at temperatures approximately 0.5 dex higher. Thus, similar column densities can be produced from fundamentally different gas. However, emission maps can provide complementary information to the line-of-sight column densities to better derive gas properties. From the simulations, we find that the brightest emission is less sensitive to the extragalactic background and that it closely follows the fundamental filamentary structure of the halo. This becomes increasingly true as the galaxy evolves from z = 1 to z = 0 and the majority of the gas transitions to a hotter, more diffuse phase. For the brightest ions (C iii, C iv, O vi), detectable emission can extend as far as 120 kpc at z = 0. Finally, resolution is a limiting factor for the conclusions we can draw from emission observations, but with moderate resolution and reasonable detection limits, upcoming instrumentation should place constraints on the physical properties of the CGM.},

 abstract = {The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is often assumed to exist in or near hydrostatic equilibrium, with the regulation of accretion and the effects of feedback treated as perturbations to a stable balance between gravity and thermal pressure. We investigate global hydrostatic equilibrium in the CGM using four highly resolved L * galaxies from the Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE) project. The FOGGIE simulations were specifically targeted at fine spatial and mass resolution in the CGM (Δx ≲ 1 kpc h −1 and M ≃ 200M ⊙). We develop a new analysis framework that calculates the forces provided by thermal pressure gradients, turbulent pressure gradients, ram pressure gradients of large-scale radial bulk flows, centrifugal rotation, and gravity acting on the gas in the CGM. Thermal and turbulent pressure gradients vary strongly on scales of ≲5 kpc throughout the CGM. Thermal pressure gradients provide the main supporting force only beyond ∼0.25R 200, or ∼50 kpc at z = 0. Within ∼0.25R 200, turbulent pressure gradients and rotational support provide stronger forces than thermal pressure. More generally, we find that global equilibrium models are neither appropriate nor predictive for the small scales probed by absorption line observations of the CGM. Local conditions generally cannot be derived by assuming a global equilibrium, but an emergent global equilibrium balancing radially inward and outward forces is obtained when averaging over the nonequilibrium local conditions on large scales in space and time. Approximate hydrostatic equilibrium holds only at large distances from galaxies, even when averaging out small-scale variations.},

 abstract = {We examine how HI and metal absorption lines within low-redshift galaxy halos trace the dynamical state of circumgalactic gas, using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include a well-vetted heuristic model for galactic outflows. We categorize inflowing, outflowing, and ambient gas based on its history and fate as tracked in our simulation. Following our earlier work showing that the ionisation level of absorbers was a primary factor in determining the physical conditions of absorbing gas, we show here that it is also a governing factor for its dynamical state. Low-ionisation metal absorbers (e.g. MgII) tend to arise in gas that will fall onto galaxies within several Gyr, while high-ionisation metal absorbers (e.g. OVI) generally trace material that was deposited by outflows many Gyr ago. Inflowing gas is dominated by enriched material that was previously ejected in an outflow, hence accretion at low redshifts is typically substantially enriched. Recycling wind material is preferentially found closer to galaxies, and is more dominant in lower-mass halos since high-mass halos have more hot gas that is able to support itself against infall. Low-mass halos also tend to re-eject more of their accreted material, owing to our outflow prescription that employs higher mass loading factors for lower-mass galaxies. Typical HI absorbers trace unenriched ambient material that is not participating in the baryon cycle, but stronger HI absorbers arise in cool, enriched inflowing gas. Instantaneous radial velocity measures of absorbers are generally poor at distinguishing between inflowing and outflowing gas, except in the case of very recent outflows. These results suggest that probing halo gas using a range of absorbers can provide detailed information about the amount and physical conditions of material that is participating in the baryon cycle.},

This O vi absorption is typically kinematically centered upon photoionized gas, with line widths that are suprathermal and kinematically offset from the galaxy. We discuss various scenarios and whether they could result in the observed phenomenology (cooling gas flows, boundary layers, shocks, virialized gas). If collisionally ionized, as we argue is most probable, the O vi observations require that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of L* galaxies holds nearly all of the associated baryons within a virial radius ( ) and hosts massive flows of cooling gas with , which must be largely prevented from accreting onto the host galaxy. Cooling and feedback energetics considerations require cm−3 K for the warm and hot halo gases. We argue that virialized gas, boundary layers, hot winds, and shocks are unlikely to directly account for the bulk of the O vi. Furthermore, we show that there is a robust constraint on the number density of many of the photoionized absorption systems that yields upper bounds in the range cm−3, suggesting that the dominant pressure in some photoionized clouds is nonthermal. This constraint is in accordance with the low densities inferred from more complex photoionization modeling. The large amount of cooling gas that is inferred could re-form these clouds in a fraction of the halo dynamical time, and it requires much of the feedback energy available from supernovae to be dissipated in the CGM.},

The simulation employs a modern implementation of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, including metal-line cooling and metal and thermal diffusion. We focus on the early assembly of the galaxy, down to redshift z = 4.4. The simulated galaxy has properties consistent with extrapolations of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies to higher redshifts and levels off to a star formation rate of ∼60 M ⊙ yr−1 at z = 4.4. A compact, thin rotating stellar disk with properties analogous to those of low-redshift systems arises already at z ∼ 8. The galaxy rapidly develops a multi-component structure, and the disk, at least at these early stages, does not grow “upside-down” as often reported in the literature. Rather, at any given time, newly born stars contribute to sustain a thin disk. The kinematics reflect the early, ubiquitous presence of a thin disk, as a stellar disk component with v ϕ /σ R larger than unity is already present at z ∼ 9–10. Our results suggest that high-resolution spectro-photometric observations of very high-redshift galaxies should find thin rotating disks, consistent with the recent discovery of cold rotating gas disks by ALMA. Finally, we present synthetic images for the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam camera, showing how the early disk would be easily detectable already at those early times.},

 abstract = {We derive stellar metallicities, light-weighted ages and stellar masses for a magnitude-limited sample of 175 128 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Two (SDSS DR2). We compute the median-likelihood estimates of these parameters using a large library of model spectra at medium‐high resolution, covering a comprehensive range of star formation histories. The constraints we derive are set by the simultaneous fit of five spectral absorption features, which are well reproduced by our population synthesis models. By design, these constraints depend only weakly on the α/Fe element abundance ratio. Our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the full range in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to actively star-forming galaxies. By analysing a subsample of 44 254 high-quality spectra, we show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence of increasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000-A break strength. For galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger Balmer absorption at fixed 4000-A break strength is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. We investigate how stellar metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxies old and metalrich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over the stellar mass range 3 × 10 9 M ∗ 3 × 10 10 M� . Both high- and low-concentration galaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellar metallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies of intermediate mass. Despite the large scatter, the relation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies. This is confirmed by the good correlation between stellar metallicity and gas-phase oxygen abundance for galaxies with both measures. The substantial range in stellar metallicity at fixed gas-phase oxygen abundance suggests that gas ejection and/or accretion are important factors in galactic chemical evolution.

 abstract = {The multi-phase circumgalactic medium (CGM) arises within the complex environment around a galaxy, or collection of galaxies, and possibly originates from a wide range of physical mechanisms. In this paper, we attempt to disentangle the origins of these multi-phase structures and present a detailed analysis of the quasar field Q0122-003 field using Keck/KCWI galaxy observations and HST/COS spectra probing the CGM. Our re-analysis of this field shows that there are two galaxies associated with the absorption. We have discovered a dwarf galaxy, G_27kpc ($M_{\star}=10^{8.7}$ M$_{\odot}$), at z=0.39863 that is 27 kpc from the quasar sightline. G_27kpc is only +21 km/s from a more massive ($M_{\star}=10^{10.5}$ M$_{\odot}$) star-forming galaxy, G_163kpc, at an impact parameter of 163 kpc. While G_163kpc is actively forming stars (SFR=6.9 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), G_27kpc has a low star-formation rate (SFR=$0.08\pm0.03$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) and star formation surface density ($\Sigma_{SFR}=0.006$ M$_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$), implying no active outflows. By comparing galaxy SFRs, kinematics, masses and distances from the quasar sightline to the absorption kinematics, column densities and metallicities, we have inferred the following: (1) Part of the low-ionization phase has a metallicity and kinematics consistent with being accreted onto G_27kpc. (2) The remainder of the low ionization phase has metallicities and kinematics consistent with being intragroup gas being transferred from G_27kpc to G_163kpc. (3) The high ionization phase is consistent with being produced solely by outflows originating from the massive halo of G_163kpc. Our results demonstrate the complex nature of the multi-phase CGM, especially around galaxy groups, and that detailed case-by-case studies are critical for disentangling its origins.},

By means of multiple ionization models and Bayesian techniques, we derive the posterior probability distribution functions for the density, metallicity, temperature and dust content of the absorbing gas. We find that z > 2 LLSs are highly ionized with ionization parameters between −3 ≲ log U ≲ −2, depending on the H I column density. LLSs are characterized by low temperatures (T 2 are characterized by a broad unimodal distribution over > 4 orders of magnitude, with a peak at log Z/Z⊙ ∼ −2. LLSs are metal poor, significantly less enriched than DLAs, with ∼70 per cent of the metallicity PDF below log Z/Z⊙ ≤ −1.5. The median metallicity of super LLSs with logNHI≥19 rapidly evolves with redshift, with a 10-fold increase between z ∼ 2.1–3.6 (∼1.5 Gyr). Based on this sample, we find that LLSs at z = 2.5–3.5 account for ∼15 per cent of all the metals produced by UV-selected galaxies. The implications for theories of cold gas accretion and metal ejection from galaxies are also discussed.},

 abstract = {Using the observations of the star formation rate (SFR) and H i densities to z ∼ 4, with measurements of the molecular gas depletion rate (MGDR) and local density of H2 at z = 0, we derive the history of the gas consumption by star formation to z ∼ 4. We find that closed-box models in which H2 is not replenished by H i require improbably large increases in ρ(H2) and a decrease in the MGDR with lookback time that is inconsistent with observations. Allowing the H2 used in star formation to be replenished by H i does not alleviate the problem because observations show that there is very little evolution of ρH i(z) from z = 0 to z = 4. We show that to be consistent with observational constraints, star formation on cosmic timescales must be fueled by intergalactic ionized gas, which may come from either accretion of gas through cold (but ionized) flows, or from ionized gas associated with accretion of dark matter halos. We constrain the rate at which the extragalactic ionized gas must be converted into H i and ultimately into H2. The ionized gas inflow rate roughly traces the SFR density: about 1–2 × 108M☉ Gyr−1 Mpc−3 from z ≃ 1–4, decreasing by about an order of magnitude from z = 1 to z = 0 with details depending largely on MGDR(t). All models considered require the volume-averaged density of to increase by a factor of 1.5–10 to z ∼ 1.5 over the currently measured value. Because the molecular gas must reside in galaxies, it implies that galaxies at high-z must, on average, be more molecule rich than they are at the present epoch, which is consistent with observations. These quantitative results, derived solely from observations, agree well with cosmological simulations.},

 abstract = {Feedback is indispensable in galaxy formation. However, lacking resolutions, cosmological simulations often use ad hoc feedback parameters. Conversely, small-box simulations, while they better resolve the feedback, cannot capture gas evolution beyond the simulation domain. We aim to bridge the gap by implementing small-box results of supernovae-driven outflows into dark matter halo-scale simulations and studying their impact on large scales. Galactic outflows are multiphase, but small-box simulations show that the hot phase (T ≈ 106–7 K) carries the majority of energy and metals. We implement hot outflows in idealized simulations of the Milky Way halo, and examine how they impact the circumgalactic medium. In this paper, we discuss the case when the star formation surface density is low and therefore the emerging hot outflows are gravitationally bound by the halo. We find that outflows form a large-scale, metal-enriched atmosphere with fountain motions. As hot gas accumulates, the inner atmosphere becomes “saturated.” Cool gas condenses, with a rate balancing the injection of the hot outflows. This balance leads to a universal density profile of the hot atmosphere, independent of mass outflow rate. The atmosphere has a radially decreasing temperature, naturally producing the observed X-ray luminosity and column densities of O vi, O vii, and O viii. The self-regulated atmosphere has a baryon and a metal mass of (0.5–1.2) × 1010 M⊙ and (0.6–1.4) × 108 M⊙, respectively, small compared to the “missing” baryons and metals from the halo. We conjecture that the missing materials reside at even larger radii, ejected by more powerful outflows in the past.},

 We have obtained new observations of the absorption system at zabs = 0.48 towards QSO Q0454−220, which we use to constrain its chemical and physical conditions. The system features metal-enriched gas and previously unknown low-metallicity gas detected ${\sim} 200 \, \mathrm{km \, s^{-1}}$ blueward of the metal-enriched gas. The low-metallicity gas is detected in multiple Lyman series lines but is not detected in any metal lines. Our analysis includes low-ionization (e.g. Fe ii, Mg ii) metal lines, high-ionization (e.g. C iv, O vi, N v) metal lines, and several Lyman series lines. We use new ultraviolet (UV) spectra taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) along with data taken from HST/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES), and Very Large Telescope(VLT)/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES). We find that the absorption system can be explained with a photoionized low-ionization phase with [Fe/H] ∼ −0.5 and $n_\mathrm{H} \sim 10^{-2.3} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, a photoionized high-ionization phase with a conservative lower limit of −3.3 < [Fe/H] and $n_\mathrm{H} \sim 10^{-3.8} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, and a low-metallicity component with a conservative upper limit of [Fe/H] < −2.5 that may be photoionized or collisionally ionized. We suggest that the low-ionization phase may be due to cold-flow accretion via large-scale filamentary structure or due to recycled accretion, while the high-ionization phase is the result of ancient outflowing material from a nearby galaxy. The low-metallicity component may come from pristine accretion. The velocity spread and disparate conditions among the absorption system’s components suggest a combination of gas arising near galaxies along with gas arising from intergroup material.},

The characteristic mass increases with environmental density from about 10 10. 6 to 10 10.9 M ⊙ (Kroupa initial mass function, H 0 = 70) for Σ in the range 0.1-10 Mpc -2 . The galaxy population naturally divides into a red and blue sequence with the locus of the sequences in colour-mass and colour-concentration indices not varying strongly with environment. The fraction of galaxies on the red sequence is determined in bins of 0.2 in log Σ and log M (12 x 13 bins). The red fraction f r generally increases continuously in both Σ and M such that there is a unified relation: f, = F(Σ, M). Two simple functions are proposed which provide good fits to the data. These data are compared with analogous quantities in semi-analytical models based on the Millennium N-body simulation: the Bower et al. and Croton et al. models that incorporate active galactic nucleus feedback. Both models predict a strong dependence of the red fraction on stellar mass and environment that is qualitatively similar to the observations. However, a quantitative comparison shows that the Bower et al. model is a significantly better match; this appears to be due to the different treatment of feedback in central galaxies.},

 abstract = {I use simulations of cosmological reionization to quantify the effect of photoionization on the gas fraction in low-mass objects, in particular the characteristic mass scale below which the gas fraction is reduced compared to the universal value. I show that this characteristic scale can be up to an order of magnitude lower than the linear-theory Jeans mass, and that even if one defines the Jeans mass at a higher overdensity, it does not track the evolution of this characteristic suppression mass. Instead, the filtering mass, which corresponds directly to the scale over which baryonic perturbations are smoothed in linear perturbation theory, provides a remarkably good fit to the characteristic mass scale. Thus, it appears that the effect of reionization on structure formation in both the linear and nonlinear regimes is described by a single characteristic scale, the filtering scale of baryonic perturbations. In contrast to the Jeans mass, the filtering mass depends on the full thermal history of the gas instead of the instantaneous value of the sound speed, so it accounts for the finite time required for pressure to influence the gas distribution in the expanding universe. In addition to the characteristic suppression mass, I study the full shape of the probability distribution to find an object with a given gas mass among all the objects with the same total mass, and I show that the numerical results can be described by a simple fitting formula that again depends only on the filtering mass. This simple description of the probability distribution may be useful for semianalytical modeling of structure formation in the early universe.},

We run the radiative transfer code skirt on a sample of submillimetre-bright galaxies drawn from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. These simulated galaxies reach Milky Way masses by z = 2. Our modelling provides predictions for the full rest-frame far-ultraviolet-to-far-infrared spectral energy distributions of these simulated galaxies, as well as 25-pc resolution maps of their emission across the wavelength spectrum. The derived morphologies are notably different in different wavebands, with the same galaxy often appearing clumpy and extended in the far-ultraviolet yet an ordered spiral at far-infrared wavelengths. The observed-frame 870-$\mu$m half-light radii of our FIRE-2 galaxies are ${\sim} 0.5\rm {-}4\, \rm {kpc}$, consistent with existing ALMA observations of galaxies with similarly high redshifts and stellar masses. In both simulated and observed galaxies, the dust continuum emission is generally more compact than the cold gas and the dust mass, but more extended than the stellar component. The most extreme cases of compact dust emission seem to be driven by particularly compact recent star formation, which generates steep dust temperature gradients. Our results confirm that the spatial extent of the dust continuum emission is sensitive to both the dust mass and star formation rate distributions.},

This recycled wind accretion, or wind mode, provides a third physically distinct accretion channel in addition to the 'hot' and 'cold' modes emphasized in recent theoretical studies. The recycling time of wind material (t rec ) is shorter in higher mass systems owing to the interaction between outflows and the increasingly higher gas densities in and around higher mass haloes. This differential recycling plays a central role in shaping the present-day galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), because declining t rec leads to increasing wind mode galaxy growth in more massive haloes. For the three feedback models explored, the wind mode dominates above a threshold mass that primarily depends on wind velocity; the shape of the GSMF therefore can be directly traced back to the feedback prescription used. If we remove all particles that were ever ejected in a wind, then the predicted GSMFs are much steeper than observed. In this case, galaxy masses are suppressed both by the ejection of gas from galaxies and by the hydrodynamic heating of their surroundings, which reduces subsequent infall. With wind recycling included, the simulation that incorporates our favoured momentum-driven wind scalings reproduces the observed GSMF for stellar masses 10 9 M ⊙ M ≤ 5 × 10 10 M ⊙ . At higher masses, wind recycling leads to excessive galaxy masses and star formation rates relative to observations. In these massive systems, some quenching mechanism must suppress not only the direct accretion from the primordial intergalactic medium but the re-accretion of gas ejected from star-forming galaxies. In short, as has long been anticipated, the form of the GSMF is governed by outflows; the unexpected twist here for our simulated winds is that it is not primarily the ejection of material but how the ejected material is re-accreted that governs the GSMF.},

 abstract = {We study the formation of galaxies in a large volume (50h Mpc, 2 × 288 particles) cosmological simulation, evolved using the entropy and energy conserving smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-2. Most of the baryonic mass in galaxies of all masses is originally acquired through filamentary “cold mode” accretion of gas that was never shock heated to its halo virial temperature, confirming the key feature of our earlier results obtained with a different SPH code (Kereš et al. 2005). Atmospheres of hot, virialized gas develop in halos above 2 − 3 × 1011M⊙, a transition mass that is nearly constant from z = 3 to z = 0. Cold accretion persists in halos above the transition mass, especially at z ≥ 2. It dominates the growth of galaxies in low mass halos at all times, and it is the main driver of the cosmic star formation history. Our results suggest that the cooling of shock-heated, virialized gas, which has been the focus of many analytic models of galaxy growth spanning more than three decades, might be a relatively minor element of galaxy formation. At high redshifts, satellite galaxies have gas accretion rates similar to central galaxies of the same baryonic mass, but at z < 1 the accretion rates of low mass satellites are well below those of comparable central galaxies. Relative to our earlier simulations, the GADGET-2simulations predict much lower rates of “hot mode” accretion from the virialized gas component. Hot accretion rates compete with cold accretion rates near the transition mass, but only at z ≤ 1. Hot accretion is inefficient in halos above ∼ 5 × 1012M⊙, with typical rates lower than 1M⊙ yr −1 at z ≤ 1, even though our simulation does not include AGN heating or other forms of “preventive” feedback. Instead, the accretion rates are low because the inner density profiles of hot gas in these halos are shallow, with long associated cooling times. The cooling recipes typically used in semi-analytic models can overestimate the accretion rates in these halos by orders of magnitude, so these models may overemphasize the role of preventive feedback in producing observed galaxy masses and colors. A fraction of the massive halos develop cuspy profiles and significant cooling rates between z = 1 and z = 0, a redshift trend similar to the observed trend in the frequency of cooling flow clusters.},

 abstract = {Theoretical models of galaxy formation predict that galaxies acquire most of their baryons via cold mode accretion. Observations of high-redshift galaxies, while showing ubiquitous outflows, have so far not revealed convincing traces of the predicted cold streams, which has been interpreted as a challenge for the current models. Using high-resolution, zoom-in smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations of Lyman break galaxy (LBG) haloes combined with ionizing radiative transfer, we quantify the covering factor of the cold streams at z= 2–4. We focus specifically on Lyman limit systems (LLSs) and damped Lyα absorbers (DLAs), which can be probed by absorption spectroscopy using a background galaxy or quasar sightline, and which are closely related to low-ionization metal absorbers. We show that the covering factor of these systems is relatively small and decreases with time. At z= 2, the covering factor of DLAs within the virial radius of the simulated galaxies is ∼3 per cent (∼1 per cent within twice this projected distance), and arises principally from the galaxy itself. The corresponding values for LLSs are ∼10 and 4 per cent. Because of their small covering factor compared to the order unity covering fraction expected for galactic winds, the cold streams are naturally dominated by outflows in stacked spectra. We conclude that the existing observations are consistent with the predictions of cold mode accretion, and outline promising kinematic and chemical diagnostics to separate out the signatures of galactic accretion and feedback.},

 abstract = {We consider the effects of different criteria for determining where stars will form in gas on galactic scales, in simulations with high (1 pc) resolution, with explicitly resolved physics of Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) formation and destruction, and stellar feedback from supernovae, radiation pressure, stellar winds and photoheating. We compare: (1) a self-gravity criterion (based on the local virial parameter and the assumption that self-gravitating gas collapses to high density in a single free-fall time), (2) a fixed density threshold, (3) a molecular-gas law, (4) a temperature threshold, (5) a requirement that the gas be Jeans unstable, (6) a criteria that cooling times be shorter than dynamical times and (7) a convergent-flow criterion. We consider all of these in both a Milky Way (MW)-like and high-density (starburst or high-redshift) galaxy. With feedback present, all models produce identical integrated star formation rates (SFRs), in good agreement with the Kennicutt relation; without feedback all produce orders-of-magnitude excessive SFRs. This is totally dependent on feedback and independent of the star formation (SF) law, even if the ‘local’ collapse efficiency is 100 per cent. However, the predicted spatial and density distribution depend strongly on the SF criteria. Because cooling rates are generally fast within galaxy discs, and gas is turbulent, criteria (4)–(7) are very ‘weak’ and spread the SF uniformly over most of the disc (down to densities n ∼ 0.01–0.1 cm^−3). A molecular criterion (3) localizes to slightly higher densities, but still a wide range; for metallicity near solar, it is almost identical to a fixed density threshold at n ∼ 1 cm^−3 (well below the mean density in the central MW or starburst systems). A fixed density threshold (2) can always select the highest resolved densities, but must be adjusted both for simulation resolution and individual galaxy properties – the same threshold that works well in a MW-like simulation will select nearly all gas in a starburst. Binding criteria (1) tend to adaptively select the largest local overdensities, independent of galaxy model or resolution, and automatically predict clustered SF. We argue that this SF model (possible with other secondary criteria) is most physically motivated and presents significant numerical advantages in simulations with a large dynamic range.},

We survey systems from ultrafaint dwarf ($M_{\ast }\sim 10^{4}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$, $M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^{9}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) through Milky Way/Local Group (MW/LG) masses, systematically vary uncertain CR parameters (e.g. the diffusion coefficient κ and streaming velocity), and study a broad ensemble of galaxy properties [masses, star formation (SF) histories, mass profiles, phase structure, morphologies, etc.]. We confirm previous conclusions that magnetic fields, conduction, and viscosity on resolved ($\gtrsim 1\,$ pc) scales have only small effects on bulk galaxy properties. CRs have relatively weak effects on all galaxy properties studied in dwarfs ($M_{\ast } \ll 10^{10}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$, $M_{\rm halo} \lesssim 10^{11}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$), or at high redshifts (z ≳ 1–2), for any physically reasonable parameters. However, at higher masses ($M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{11}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) and z ≲ 1–2, CRs can suppress SF and stellar masses by factors ∼2–4, given reasonable injection efficiencies and relatively high effective diffusion coefficients $\kappa \gtrsim 3\times 10^{29}\, {\rm cm^{2}\, s^{-1}}$. At lower κ, CRs take too long to escape dense star-forming gas and lose their energy to collisional hadronic losses, producing negligible effects on galaxies and violating empirical constraints from spallation and γ-ray emission. At much higher κ CRs escape too efficiently to have appreciable effects even in the CGM. But around $\kappa \sim 3\times 10^{29}\, {\rm cm^{2}\, s^{-1}}$, CRs escape the galaxy and build up a CR-pressure-dominated halo which maintains approximate virial equilibrium and supports relatively dense, cool (T ≪ 106 K) gas that would otherwise rain on to the galaxy. CR ‘heating’ (from collisional and streaming losses) is never dominant.},

We search for H i absorption systems occurring at the same redshift (within 500 km s−1) in multiple sightlines, finding with > 99.9% significance that these systems are more frequent in the observed quasar spectra than in a randomly distributed population of absorbers. This is driven primarily by absorption with column densities N(H i) > 1014 cm−2, whilst multi-sightline absorbers with lower column densities are consistent with a random distribution. Star-forming galaxies are more likely to be associated with multisightline absorption than quiescent galaxies. HST imaging provides inclinations and position angles for a subset of these galaxies. We observe a bimodality in the position angle of detected galaxy-absorber pairs, again driven mostly by high-column-density absorbers, with absorption preferentially along the major and minor axes of galaxies out to impact parameters of several hundred kpc. We find some evidence supporting a disk/outflow dichotomy, as H i absorbers near the projected major-axis of a galaxy show line-of-sight velocities that tend to align with the rotation of that galaxy, whilst minor-axis absorbers are twice as likely to exhibit Ovi at the same redshift.},

In Lehner et al., we recently showed that low-z LLSs have a bimodal metallicity distribution. Here we extend that analysis to search for differences between the high-ion and kinematic properties of the metal-poor and metal-rich branches. We find that metal-rich LLSs tend to show higher O vi columns and broader O vi profiles than metal-poor LLSs. The total H i line width (Δv90 statistic) in LLSs is not correlated with metallicity, indicating that the H i kinematics alone cannot be used to distinguish inflow from outflow and gas recycling. Among the 17 LLSs with O vi detections, all but two show evidence of kinematic sub-structure, in the form of O vi–H i centroid offsets, multiple components, or both. Using various scenarios for how the metallicities in the high-ion and low-ion phases of each LLS compare, we constrain the ionized hydrogen column in the O vi phase to lie in the range log N(H ii) ∼ 17.6–20. The O vi phase of LLSs is a substantial baryon reservoir, with M(high-ion) ∼ 108.5–10.9 (r/150 kpc)2 M☉, similar to the mass in the low-ion phase.

 abstract = {We study the properties of massive, galactic-scale outflows of molecular gas and investigate their impact on galaxy evolution. We present new IRAMPdBI CO(1-0) observations of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and quasar-hosts: a clear signature of massive and energetic molecular outflows, extending on kpc scales, is found in the CO(1-0) kinematics of four out of seven sources, with measured outflow rates of several 100M(circle dot)yr(-1). We combine these new observations with data from the literature, and explore the nature and origin of massive molecular outflows within an extended sample of 19 local galaxies. We find that starburst-dominated galaxies have an outflow rate comparable to their star formation rate (SFR), or even higher by a factor of similar to 2-4, implying that starbursts can indeed be effective in removing cold gas from galaxies. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can boost the outflow rate by a large factor, which is found to increase with the L-AGN/L-bol ratio. The gas depletion time scales due to molecular outflows are anti-correlated with the presence and luminosity of an AGN in these galaxies, and range from a few hundred million years in starburst galaxies down to just a few million years in galaxies hosting powerful AGNs. In quasar hosts, the depletion time scales due to the outflow are much shorter than the depletion time scales due to star formation. We estimate the outflow kinetic power and find that, for galaxies hosting powerful AGNs, it corresponds to about 5% of the AGN luminosity, as expected by models of AGN feedback. Moreover, we find that momentum rates of about 20 L-AGN/c are common among the AGN-dominated sources in our sample. For "pure" starburst galaxies, our data tentatively support models in which outflows are mostly momentum-driven by the radiation pressure from young stars onto dusty clouds. Overall, our results indicate that, although starbursts are effective in powering massive molecular outflows, the presence of an AGN may strongly enhance such outflows, and therefore have a profound feedback effect on the evolution of galaxies by efficiently removing fuel for star formation, hence quenching star formation.},

Through an analysis of 71 quasars, we determine the incidence frequency of LLS per unit redshift and per unit path length, ℓ(z) and ℓ(X), respectively, over the redshift range 1 < z < 2.6, and find a weighted mean of ℓ(X) =0.29 ± 0.05 for 2.0 < z < 2.5 through a joint analysis of our sample and that of Ribaudo et al. Through stacked spectrum analysis, we determine a median (mean) value of the mean free path to ionizing radiation at z = 2.4 of λ912mfp = 243(252) h−172 Mpc, with an error on the mean value of ±43 h−172 Mpc. We also re-evaluate the estimates of λ912mfp from Prochaska et al. and place constraints on the evolution of λ912mfp with redshift, including an estimate of the “breakthrough” redshift of z = 1.6. Consistent with results at higher z, we find that a significant fraction of the opacity for absorption of ionizing photons comes from systems with NH i ⩽1017.5 cm−2 with a value for the total Lyman opacity of τLymaneff = 0.40 ± 0.15. Finally, we determine that at minimum, a 5-parameter (4 power law) model is needed to describe the column density distribution function f(NH i, X) at z ∼ 2.4, find that f(NH i, X) undergoes no significant change in shape between z ∼ 2.4 and z ∼ 3.7, and provide our best fit model for f(NH i, X).},

This is significantly lower than the filtering mass obtained by the linear theory, which is often used in semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. We demonstrate it is the gas temperature at the virial radius which determines whether a halo can accrete gas. A simple model that follows the merger history of the dark matter progenitors, and where gas accretion is not allowed when this temperature is higher than the virial temperature of the halo, reproduces the results from the simulation remarkably well. This model can be applied to any reionization history, and is easy to incorporate in semi-analytical models.},

 abstract = {We analyze an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic cosmological simulation of a Milky-Way-sized galaxy to study the cold gas in the halo. H i observations of the Milky Way and other nearby spirals have revealed the presence of such gas in the form of clouds and other extended structures, which indicates ongoing accretion. We use a high-resolution simulation (136–272 pc throughout) to study the distribution of cold gas in the halo, compare it with observations, and examine its origin. The amount (∼108 M☉ in H i), covering fraction, and spatial distribution of the cold halo gas around the simulated galaxy at z = 0 are consistent with existing observations. At z = 0, the H i mass accretion rate onto the disk is 0.2 M☉ yr−1. We track the histories of the 20 satellites that are detected in H i in the redshift interval 0.5 > z > 0 and find that most of them are losing gas, with a median mass-loss rate per satellite of 3.1 × 10−3 M☉ yr−1. This stripped gas is a significant component of the H i gas seen in the simulation. In addition, we see filamentary material coming into the halo from the intergalactic medium at all redshifts. Most of this gas does not make it directly to the disk, but part of the gas in these structures is able to cool and form clouds. The metallicity of the gas allows us to distinguish between filamentary flows and satellite gas. We find that the former accounts for at least 25%–75% of the cold gas in the halo seen at any redshift analyzed here. Placing constraints on cloud formation mechanisms allows us to better understand how galaxies accrete gas and fuel star formation at z = 0.},

 abstract = {We use the observed cumulative statistics of C iv absorbers and dark matter halos to infer the distribution of C iv-absorbing gas relative to galaxies at redshifts 0 ≤ z ≤ 5. We compare the cosmic incidence dN/dX of C iv absorber populations and galaxy halos, finding that massive L ≥ L ⋆ halos alone cannot account for all the observed W r ≥ 0.05 Å absorbers. However, the dN/dX of lower-mass halos exceeds that of W r ≥ 0.05 Å absorbers. We also estimate the characteristic gas radius of absorbing structures required for the observed C iv dN/dX, assuming each absorber is associated with a single galaxy halo. The W r ≥ 0.3 Å and W r ≥ 0.6 Å C iv gas radii are ∼30%–70% (∼20%–40%) of the virial radius of L ⋆ (0.1L ⋆) galaxies, and the W r ≥ 0.05 Å gas radius is ∼100%–150% (∼60%–100%) of the virial radius of L ⋆ (0.1L ⋆) galaxies. For stronger absorbers, the gas radius relative to the virial radius rises across Cosmic Noon and falls afterwards, while for weaker absorbers, the relative gas radius declines across Cosmic Noon and then dramatically rises at z < 1. A strong luminosity-dependence of the gas radius implies highly extended C iv envelopes around massive galaxies before Cosmic Noon, while a luminosity-independent gas radius implies highly extended envelopes around dwarf galaxies after Cosmic Noon. From available absorber-galaxy and C iv evolution data, we favor a scenario in which low-mass galaxies enrich the volume around massive galaxies at early epochs and propose that the outer halo gas (>0.5 R v ) was produced primarily in ancient satellite dwarf galaxy outflows, while the inner halo gas (<0.5 R v ) originated from the central galaxy and persists as recycled accreting gas.},

 abstract = {We present an analysis of the metallicity distribution of the dense circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies at 0.1 ≲ z ≲ 1.1 as probed by partial Lyman limit systems (pLLSs, 16.1 < log < 17.2) and LLSs (17.2 ≤ log < 17.7 in our sample). The new H i-selected sample, drawn from our Hubble Space Telescope COS G140L snapshot survey of 61 QSOs, has 20 pLLSs and 10 LLSs. Combined with our previous survey, we have a total of 44 pLLSs and 11 LLSs. We find that the metallicity distribution of the pLLSs is bimodal at z ≲ 1, with a minimum at [X/H] = −1. The low-metallicity peak comprises (57 ± 8)% of the pLLSs and is centered at [X/H] ≃ −1.87(1.3% solar metallicity), while the high-metallicity peak is centered at [X/H] ≃ −0.32 (48% solar metallicity). Although the sample of LLSs is still small, there is some evidence that the metallicity distributions of the LLSs and pLLSs are different, with a far lower fraction of very metal-poor ([X/H] < −1.4) LLSs than pLLSs. The fraction of LLSs with [X/H] < −1 is similar to that found in pLLSs (∼56%). However, higher H i column density absorbers (log > 19.0) show a much lower fraction of metal-poor gas; therefore, the metallicity distribution of gas in and around galaxies depends sensitively on NH i at z ≲ 1. We interpret the high-metallicity ([X/H] ≥ −1) pLLSs and LLSs as arising in outflows, recycling winds, and tidally stripped gas around galaxies. The low-metallicity pLLSs and LLSs imply that the CGM of z ≲ 1 galaxies hosts a substantial mass of cool, dense, low-metallicity gas that may ultimately accrete onto the galaxies.},

 abstract = {We report new observations of circumgalactic gas from the COS-Dwarfs survey, a systematic investigation of the gaseous halos around 43 low-mass z ⩽ 0.1 galaxies using background QSOs observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. From the projected one-dimensional and two-dimensional distribution of C iv absorption, we find that C iv is detected out to ≈100 kpc (corresponding roughly to ≈0.5 Rvir) of the host galaxies. The C iv absorption strength falls off radially as a power law, and beyond ≈0.5 Rvir, no C iv absorption is detected above our sensitivity limit of ≈50–100 mÅ. We find a tentative correlation between detected C iv absorption strength and star formation, paralleling the strong correlation seen in highly ionized oxygen for L  ∼ L* galaxies by the COS-Halos survey. The data imply a large carbon reservoir in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of these galaxies, corresponding to a minimum carbon mass of ≳ 1.2 × 106 M☉ out to ∼110 kpc. This mass is comparable to the carbon mass in the interstellar medium and exceeds the carbon mass currently in the stars of these galaxies. The C iv absorption seen around these sub-L* galaxies can account for almost two-thirds of all Wr ⩾ 100 mÅ C iv absorption detected at low z. Comparing the C iv covering fraction with hydrodynamical simulations, we find that an energy-driven wind model is consistent with the observations whereas a wind model of constant velocity fails to reproduce the CGM or the galaxy properties.},

 abstract = {Passive-scalar mixing (metals, molecules, etc.) in the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) is critical for abundance patterns of stars and clusters, galaxy and star formation, and cooling from the circumgalactic medium. However, the fundamental scaling laws remain poorly understood in the highly supersonic, magnetized, shearing regime relevant for the ISM. We therefore study the full scaling laws governing passive-scalar transport in idealized simulations of supersonic turbulence. Using simple phenomenological arguments for the variation of diffusivity with scale based on Richardson diffusion, we propose a simple fractional diffusion equation to describe the turbulent advection of an initial passive scalar distribution. These predictions agree well with the measurements from simulations, and vary with turbulent Mach number in the expected manner, remaining valid even in the presence of a large-scale shear flow (e.g. rotation in a galactic disc). The evolution of the scalar distribution is not the same as obtained using simple, constant ‘effective diffusivity’ as in Smagorinsky models, because the scale dependence of turbulent transport means an initially Gaussian distribution quickly develops highly non-Gaussian tails. We also emphasize that these are mean scalings that apply only to ensemble behaviours (assuming many different, random scalar injection sites): individual Lagrangian ‘patches’ remain coherent (poorly mixed) and simply advect for a large number of turbulent flow-crossing times.},

 abstract = {We present a new method aimed at improving the efficiency of component by component ionization modeling of intervening quasar absorption line systems. We carry out cloud-by-cloud, multiphase modeling making use of CLOUDY and Bayesian methods to extract physical properties from an ensemble of absorption profiles. Here, as a demonstration of method, we focus on four weak, low ionization absorbers at low redshift, because they are multi-phase but relatively simple to constrain. We place errors on the inferred metallicities and ionization parameters for individual clouds, and show that the values differ from component to component across the absorption profile. Our method requires user input on the number of phases and relies on an optimized transition for each phase, one observed with high resolution and signal-to-noise. The measured Doppler parameter of the optimized transition provides a constraint on the Doppler parameter of HI, thus providing leverage in metallicity measurements even when hydrogen lines are saturated. We present several tests of our methodology, demonstrating that we can recover the input parameters from simulated profiles. We also consider how our model results are affected by which radiative transitions are covered by observations (for example how many HI transitions) and by uncertainties in the b parameters of optimized transitions. We discuss the successes and limitations of the method, and consider its potential for large statistical studies. This improved methodology will help to establish direct connections between the diverse properties derived from characterizing the absorbers and the multiple physical processes at play in the circumgalactic medium.},

We find that the presence of a photoionizing background suppresses the formation of galaxies with circular velocities $v_{circ} \simlt 30\,$\kms\ and substantially reduces the mass of cooled baryons in systems with circular velocities up to $v_{circ} \sim 50\,$\kms. Above $v_{circ} \sim 75\,$\kms, photoionization has no significant effect. Photoionization exerts its influence primarily by heating gas before collapse; the elimination of line cooling processes is less important. We discuss the implications of these results for hierarchical theories of galaxy formation.},

 abstract = {Pinpointing a single fast radio burst Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are flashes of radio emission from distant astronomical sources. Two FRBs are known to have repeated, but most last just a few milliseconds and are never seen again. Most telescopes that are sensitive to single FRBs have poor angular resolutions, so the FRB host galaxies remain unknown. Bannister et al. used a dedicated observing mode on a radio interferometer to detect and localize the nonrepeating FRB 180924, then followed up with optical telescope observations (see the Perspective by Petroff). They found that the FRB came from a medium-sized galaxy at a cosmological distance. Localizing FRBs will help determine their causes and allow them to be used as cosmological probes. Science, this issue p. 565; see also p. 546 Radio interferometry has been used to detect and localize a single nonrepeating fast radio burst. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief radio emissions from distant astronomical sources. Some are known to repeat, but most are single bursts. Nonrepeating FRB observations have had insufficient positional accuracy to localize them to an individual host galaxy. We report the interferometric localization of the single-pulse FRB 180924 to a position 4 kiloparsecs from the center of a luminous galaxy at redshift 0.3214. The burst has not been observed to repeat. The properties of the burst and its host are markedly different from those of the only other accurately localized FRB source. The integrated electron column density along the line of sight closely matches models of the intergalactic medium, indicating that some FRBs are clean probes of the baryonic component of the cosmic web.},

 abstract = {We argue that the interplay between cosmic rays, the initial mass function (IMF), and star formation plays a crucial role in regulating the star-forming “main sequence.” To explore these phenomena we develop a toy model for galaxy evolution in which star formation is regulated by a combination of a temperature-dependent IMF and heating due to starlight, cosmic rays, and (at very high redshift) the cosmic microwave background. This produces an attractor, near-equilibrium solution which is consistent with observations of the star-forming main sequence over a broad redshift range. Additional solutions to the same equations may correspond to other observed phases of galaxy evolution, including quiescent galaxies. This model makes several falsifiable predictions, including higher metallicities and dust masses than anticipated at high redshift and isotopic abundances in the Milky Way. It also predicts that stellar mass-to-light ratios are lower than produced using a Milky Way–derived IMF, such that inferences of stellar masses and star formation rates for high redshift galaxies are overestimated. In some cases, this may also transform inferred dark matter profiles from core-like to cusp-like.},

 abstract = {Galaxy formation models are now able to reproduce observed relations such as the relation between galaxies’ star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses (M^*) and the stellar-mass–halo-mass relation. We demonstrate that comparisons of the short-time-scale variability in galaxy SFRs with observational data provide an additional useful constraint on the physics of galaxy formation feedback. We apply SFR indicators with different sensitivity time-scales to galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. We find that the SFR–M* relation has a significantly greater scatter when the Hα-derived SFR is considered compared with when the far-ultraviolet (FUV)-based SFR is used. This difference is a direct consequence of bursty star formation because the FIRE galaxies exhibit order-of-magnitude SFR variations over time-scales of a few Myr. We show that the difference in the scatter between the simulated Hα- and FUV-derived SFR–M^* relations at z = 2 is consistent with observational constraints. We also find that the Hα/FUV ratios predicted by the simulations at z = 0 are similar to those observed for local galaxies except for a population of low-mass (M* ≲ 10^(9.5) M_⊙) simulated galaxies with lower Hα/FUV ratios than observed. We suggest that future cosmological simulations should compare the Hα/FUV ratios of their galaxies with observations to constrain the feedback models employed.},

 abstract = {The high incidence rate of the O vi λλ1032, 1038 absorption around low-redshift, ∼L * star-forming galaxies has generated interest in studies of the circumgalactic medium. We use the high-resolution EAGLE cosmological simulation to analyze the circumgalactic O vi gas around z ≈ 0.3 star-forming galaxies. Motivated by the limitation that observations do not reveal where the gas lies along the line of sight, we compare the O vi measurements produced by gas within fixed distances around galaxies and by gas selected using line-of-sight velocity cuts commonly adopted by observers. We show that gas selected by a velocity cut of ±300 km s−1 or ±500 km s−1 produces a higher O vi column density, a flatter column density profile, and a higher covering fraction compared to gas within 1, 2, or 3 times the virial radius (r vir) of galaxies. The discrepancy increases with impact parameter and worsens for lower-mass galaxies. For example, compared to the gas within 2 r vir, identifying the gas using velocity cuts of 200–500 km s−1 increases the O vi column density by 0.2 dex (0.1 dex) at 1 r vir to over 0.75 dex (0.7 dex) at ≈ 2 r vir for galaxies with stellar masses of 109–109.5 M ⊙ (1010–1010.5 M ⊙). We furthermore estimate that excluding O vi outside r vir decreases the circumgalactic oxygen mass measured by Tumlinson et al. (2011) by over 50%. Our results demonstrate that gas at large line-of-sight separations but selected by conventional velocity windows has significant effects on the O vi measurements and may not be observationally distinguishable from gas near the galaxies.},

 abstract = {We analyze the metal accumulation in dwarf and spiral galaxies by following the history of metal enrichment and outflows in a suite of 20 high-resolution simulated galaxies. These simulations agree with the observed stellar and gas-phase mass–metallicity relation, an agreement that relies on large fractions of the produced metals escaping into the circumgalactic media. For instance, in galaxies with Mvir ∼ 109.5–1010 , we find that about ∼85% of the available metals are outside of the galactic disk at z = 0, although the fraction decreases to a little less than half in Milky-Way-mass galaxies. In many cases, these metals are spread far beyond the virial radius. We analyze the metal deficit within the ISM and stars in the context of previous work tracking the inflow and outflow of baryons. Outflows are prevalent across the entire mass range, as is reaccretion. We find that between 40% and 80% of all metals removed from the galactic disk are later reaccreted. The outflows themselves are metal-enriched relative to the ISM by a factor of 0.2 dex because of the correspondence between sites of metal enrichment and outflows. As a result, the metal mass loading factor scales as , a somewhat shallower scaling than the total mass loading factor. We analyze the simulated galaxies within the context of analytic chemical evolution models by determining their net metal expulsion efficiencies, which encapsulate the rates of metal loss and reaccretion. We discuss these results in light of the inflow and outflow properties necessary for reproducing the mass–metallicity relation.},

We investigate the variation of Mg ii rest-frame equivalent width (EW) as a function of the radial impact parameter for different subsets of foreground galaxies selected in terms of their rest-frame colors and masses. Blue galaxies have a significantly higher average Mg ii EW at close galactocentric radii as compared to the red galaxies. Among the blue galaxies, there is a correlation between Mg ii EW and galactic stellar mass of the host galaxy. We also find that the distribution of Mg ii absorption around group galaxies is more extended than that for non-group galaxies, and that groups as a whole have more extended radial profiles than individual galaxies. Interestingly, these effects can be satisfactorily modeled by a simple superposition of the absorption profiles of individual member galaxies, assuming that these are the same as those of non-group galaxies, suggesting that the group environment may not significantly enhance or diminish the Mg ii absorption of individual galaxies. We show that there is a strong azimuthal dependence of the Mg ii absorption within 50 kpc of inclined disk-dominated galaxies, indicating the presence of a strongly bipolar outflow aligned along the disk rotation axis. There is no significant dependence of Mg ii absorption on the apparent inclination angle of disk-dominated galaxies.},

 We present a framework for characterizing the large-scale movement of baryons relative to dark matter in cosmological simulations, requiring only the initial conditions and final state of the simulation. This is performed using the spread metric that quantifies the distance in the final conditions between initially neighbouring particles, and by analysing the baryonic content of final haloes relative to that of the initial Lagrangian regions (LRs) defined by their dark matter component. Applying this framework to the simba cosmological simulations, we show that 40 per cent (10 per cent) of cosmological baryons have moved $\gt 1\, h^{-1}\, {\rm Mpc}{}$ ($3\, h^{-1}\, {\rm Mpc}{}$) by z = 0, primarily due to entrainment of gas by jets powered by an active galactic nucleus, with baryons moving up to $12\, h^{-1}\, {\rm Mpc}{}$ away in extreme cases. Baryons decouple from the dynamics of the dark matter component due to hydrodynamic forces, radiative cooling, and feedback processes. As a result, only 60 per cent of the gas content in a given halo at z = 0 originates from its LR, roughly independent of halo mass. A typical halo in the mass range Mvir = 1012–1013 M⊙ only retains 20 per cent of the gas originally contained in its LR. We show that up to 20 per cent of the gas content in a typical Milky Way-mass halo may originate in the region defined by the dark matter of another halo. This inter-Lagrangian baryon transfer may have important implications for the origin of gas and metals in the circumgalactic medium of galaxies, as well as for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and ‘zoom-in’ simulations.},

 abstract = {We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with stellar feedback from the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments) project to study the physical nature of Lyman limit systems (LLSs) at z ≤ 1. At these low redshifts, LLSs are closely associated with dense gas structures surrounding galaxies, such as galactic winds, dwarf satellites and cool inflows from the intergalactic medium. Our analysis is based on 14 zoom-in simulations covering the halo mass range M_h ≈ 10^9–10^(13) M⊙ at z = 0, which we convolve with the dark matter halo mass function to produce cosmological statistics. We find that the majority of cosmologically selected LLSs are associated with haloes in the mass range 10^(10) ≲ M_h ≲ 10^(12) M⊙. The incidence and H I column density distribution of simulated absorbers with columns in the range 10^(16.2)≤N_(HI)≤2×10^(20) Cm^(−2) are consistent with observations. High-velocity outflows (with radial velocity exceeding the halo circular velocity by a factor of ≳ 2) tend to have higher metallicities ([X/H] ∼ −0.5) while very low metallicity ([X/H] < −2) LLSs are typically associated with gas infalling from the intergalactic medium. However, most LLSs occupy an intermediate region in metallicity-radial velocity space, for which there is no clear trend between metallicity and radial kinematics. The overall simulated LLS metallicity distribution has a mean (standard deviation) [X/H] = −0.9 (0.4) and does not show significant evidence for bimodality, in contrast to recent observational studies, but consistent with LLSs arising from haloes with a broad range of masses and metallicities.},

This contrasts strongly with comparatively isolated dwarf galaxies, which are almost all actively star-forming and gas-rich. This near dichotomy implies a rapid transformation of satellite dwarf galaxies after falling into the halos of the MW or M31. We combine the observed quiescent fractions for satellites of the MW and M31 with the infall times of satellites from the Exploring the Local Volume in Simulations (ELVIS) suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations to determine the typical timescales over which environmental processes within the MW/M31 halos remove gas and quench star formation in low-mass satellite galaxies. The quenching timescales for satellites with M star < 10 8 M ⊙ ?> are short, ≲ 2 ?> Gyr, and quenching is more rapid at lower M star ?> . These satellite quenching timescales can be 1–2 Gyr longer if one includes the time that satellites were environmentally preprocessed by low-mass groups prior to MW/M31 infall. We compare with quenching timescales for more massive satellites from previous works to synthesize the nature of satellite galaxy quenching across the observable range of M star = 10 3 − 11 M ⊙ ?> . The satellite quenching timescale increases rapidly with satellite M star ?> , peaking at ≈ 9.5 ?> Gyr for M star ∼ 10 9 M ⊙ ?> , and the timescale rapidly decreases at higher M star ?> to < 5 ?> Gyr at M star > 5 × 10 9 M ⊙ ?> .

 abstract = {We present and discuss the mean rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum for a sample of 81 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) selected to be B-band dropouts at z ≃ 4. The sample is mostly drawn from our ongoing Keck/DEIMOS survey in the GOODS fields and augmented with archival Very Large Telescope data. In general, we find similar spectroscopic trends to those found in earlier surveys of LBGs at z = 3. Specifically, low-ionization absorption lines which trace neutral outflowing gas are weaker in galaxies with stronger Lyα emission, bluer UV spectral slopes, lower stellar masses, lower UV luminosities, and smaller half-light radii. This is consistent with a physical picture whereby star formation drives outflows of neutral gas which scatter Lyα and produce strong low-ionization absorption lines, while increasing galaxy stellar mass, size, metallicity, and dust content. Typical galaxies are thus expected to have stronger Lyα emission and weaker low-ionization absorption at earlier times, and we indeed find somewhat weaker low-ionization absorption at higher redshifts. In conjunction with earlier results from our survey, we argue that the reduced low-ionization absorption is likely caused by lower covering fraction and/or velocity range of outflowing neutral gas at earlier epochs. Although low-ionization absorption decreases at higher redshift, fine-structure emission lines are stronger, suggesting a greater concentration of neutral gas at small galactocentric radius (≲ 5 kpc). Our continuing survey will enable us to extend these diagnostics more reliably to higher redshift and determine the implications for the escape fraction of ionizing photons which governs the role of early galaxies in cosmic reionization.},

Galaxy ISM metallicities were measured using Hα/[N ii] emission lines from Keck/ESI spectra. CGM single-phase low-ionization metallicities were modeled using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Cloudy analysis of absorption from HST/COS and Keck/HIRES or VLT/UVES quasar spectra. We find that the star-forming galaxy ISM metallicities follow the observed stellar mass–metallicity relation (1σ scatter 0.19 dex). CGM metallicity shows no dependence with stellar mass and exhibits a scatter of ∼2 dex. All CGM metallicities are lower than the galaxy ISM metallicities and are offset by log(dZ) = −1.17 ± 0.11. There is no obvious metallicity gradient as a function of impact parameter or virial radius (<2.3σ significance). There is no relationship between the relative CGM-galaxy metallicity and azimuthal angle. We find the mean metallicity differences along the major and minor axes are −1.13 ± 0.18 and −1.23 ± 0.11, respectively. Regardless of whether we examine our sample by low/high inclination or low/high impact parameter, or low/high N(H i), we do not find any significant relationship with relative CGM-galaxy metallicity and azimuthal angle. We find that 10/15 low column density systems (logN(H i) < 17.2) reside along the galaxy major axis while high column density systems (logN(H i) ≥ 17.2) reside along the minor axis. This suggests N(H i) could be a useful indicator of accretion/outflows. We conclude that CGM is not well mixed, given the range of galaxy-CGM metallicities, and that metallicity at low redshift might not be a good tracer of CGM processes. On the other hand, we should replace integrated line-of-sight, single-phase metallicities with multiphase, cloud–cloud metallicities, which could be more indicative of the physical processes within the CGM.},

In this work we present the freely available MPI parallel halo finder Ahf. We provide a description of the algorithm and the strategy followed to handle large simulation data. We also describe the parameters a user may choose in order to influence the process of halo finding, as well as pointing out which parameters are crucial to ensure untainted results from the parallel approach.

In this study, we forecast constraints on the feedback processes heating the CGM with current and future Sunyaev–Zeldovich (SZ) observations. To constrain these processes, we use a suite of cosmological simulations, the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS). CAMELS varies four different feedback parameters of two previously existing hydrodynamical simulations, IllustrisTNG and SIMBA. We capture the dependences of SZ radial profiles on these feedback parameters with an emulator, calculate their derivatives, and forecast future constraints on these feedback parameters from upcoming experiments. We find that for a galaxy sample similar to what would be obtained with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument at the Simons Observatory, all four feedback parameters can be constrained (some within the 10% level), indicating that future observations will be able to further restrict the parameter space for these subgrid models. Given the modeled galaxy sample and forecasted errors in this work, we find that the inner SZ profiles contribute more to the constraining power than the outer profiles. Finally, we find that, despite the wide range of parameter variation in active galactic feedback in the CAMELS simulation suite, we cannot reproduce the thermal SZ signal of galaxies selected by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey as measured by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope.},

 abstract = {We present the equivalent width and column density measurements for low and intermediate ionization states of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding 44 low-z, L ≈ L* galaxies drawn from the COS-Halos survey. These measurements are derived from far-UV transitions observed in HST/COS and Keck/HIRES spectra of background quasars within an impact parameter R < 160 kpc to the targeted galaxies. The data show significant metal-line absorption for 33 of the 44 galaxies, including quiescent systems, revealing the common occurrence of a cool (T ≈ 104–105 K), metal-enriched CGM. The detection rates and column densities derived for these metal lines decrease with increasing impact parameter, a trend we interpret as a declining metal surface density profile for the CGM. A comparison of the relative column densities of adjacent ionization states indicates that the gas is predominantly ionized. The large surface density in metals demands a large reservoir of metals and gas in the cool CGM (very conservatively, McoolCGM > 109 M☉), which likely traces a distinct density and/or temperature regime from the highly ionized CGM traced by O+5 absorption. The large dispersion in absorption strengths (including non-detections) suggests that the cool CGM traces a wide range of densities or a mix of local ionizing conditions. Lastly, the kinematics inferred from the metal-line profiles are consistent with the cool CGM being bound to the dark matter halos hosting the galaxies; this gas may serve as fuel for future star formation. Future work will leverage this data set to provide estimates on the mass, metallicity, dynamics, and origin of the cool CGM in low-z, L* galaxies.},
