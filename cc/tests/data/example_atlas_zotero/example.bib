  abstract = {We examine the thermodynamic state and cooling of the low-\$z\$ Circum-Galactic Medium (CGM) in five FIRE-2 galaxy formation simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find that the CGM in these simulations is generally multiphase and dynamic, with a wide spectrum of largely nonlinear density perturbations sourced by the accretion of gas from the IGM and winds from both the central and satellite galaxies. We investigate the origin of the multiphase structure of the CGM with a particle tracking analysis and find that most of the low entropy gas has cooled from the hot halo as a result of thermal instability triggered by these perturbations. The ratio of cooling to free-fall timescales \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm cool\}/t\_\{\textbackslash rm ff\}\$ in the hot component of the CGM spans a wide range \$\textbackslash sim 1-100\$ at a given radius, but exhibits approximately constant median values \$\textbackslash sim 5-20\$ at all radii \$0.1 R\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\} {$<$} r {$<$} R\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}\$. These are similar to the \$\textbackslash approx 10-20\$ value typically adopted as the thermal instability threshold in "precipitation" models of the ICM. Consequently, a one-dimensional model based on the assumption of a constant \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm cool\}/t\_\{\textbackslash rm ff\}\$ and hydrostatic equilibrium approximately reproduces the simulation number density and entropy profiles, but only if it assumes the metallicity profiles taken directly from the simulations. We explicitly show that the \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm cool\}/t\_\{\textbackslash rm ff\}\$ value of a gas parcel in the hot component of the CGM does not predict its probability of cooling and subsequently accreting onto the central galaxy. This suggests that the value of \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm cool\}/t\_\{\textbackslash rm ff\}\$ is a poor predictor of thermal stability in gaseous halos in which large-amplitude density perturbations are prevalent.},

Our sample ranges from compact, bulge-dominated systems with 90\% of their stellar mass within 2.5 kpc to well-ordered disks that reach \$\textbackslash gtrsim15\$ kpc. The gas in our galaxies always forms a thin, rotation-supported disk at \$z=0\$, with sizes primarily determined by the gas mass. For stars, we quantify kinematics and morphology both via the fraction of stars on disk-like orbits and with the radial extent of the stellar disk. In this mass range, stellar morphology and kinematics are poorly correlated with the properties of the halo available from dark matter-only simulations (halo merger history, spin, or formation time). They more strongly correlate with the gaseous histories of the galaxies: those that maintain a high gas mass in the disk after \$z\textbackslash sim1\$ develop well-ordered stellar disks. The best predictor of morphology we identify is the spin of the gas in the halo at the time the galaxy formed 1/2 of its stars (i.e. the gas that builds the galaxy). High-\$z\$ mergers, before a hot halo emerges, produce some of the most massive bulges in the sample (from compact disks in gas-rich mergers), while later-forming bulges typically originate from internal processes, as satellites are stripped of gas before the galaxies merge. Moreover, most stars in \$z=0\$ MW-mass galaxies (even \$z=0\$ bulge stars) form in a disk: \$\textbackslash gtrsim\$60-90\% of stars begin their lives rotationally supported.},

  abstract = {Pressure balance plays a central role in models of the interstellar medium (ISM), but whether and how pressure balance is realized in a realistic multiphase ISM is not yet well understood. We address this question using a set of FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass disk galaxies, in which a multiphase ISM is self-consistently shaped by gravity, cooling, and stellar feedback. We analyze how gravity determines the vertical pressure profile as well as how the total ISM pressure is partitioned between different phases and components (thermal, dispersion/turbulence, and bulk flows). We show that, on average and consistent with previous more idealized simulations, the total ISM pressure balances the weight of the overlying gas. Deviations from vertical pressure balance increase with increasing galactocentric radius and with decreasing averaging scale. The different phases are in rough total pressure equilibrium with one another, but with large deviations from thermal pressure equilibrium owing to kinetic support in the cold and warm phases, which dominate the total pressure near the midplane. Bulk flows (e.g., inflows and fountains) are important at a few disk scale heights, while thermal pressure from hot gas dominates at larger heights. Overall, the total midplane pressure is well-predicted by the weight of the disk gas, and we show that it also scales linearly with the star formation rate surface density (Sigma\_SFR). These results support the notion that the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation arises because Sigma\_SFR and the gas surface density (Sigma\_g) are connected via the ISM midplane pressure.},

At these low redshifts, LLSs are closely associated with dense gas structures surrounding galaxies, such as galactic winds, dwarf satellites, and cool inflows from the intergalactic medium. Our analysis is based on 14 zoom-in simulations covering the halo mass range M\_h\textasciitilde 10\^9-10\^13 Msun at z=0, which we convolve with the dark matter halo mass function to produce cosmological statistics. We find that the majority of cosmologically-selected LLSs are associated with halos in the mass range 10\^10 {$<$} M\_h {$<$} 10\^12 Msun. The incidence and HI column density distribution of simulated absorbers with columns 10\^16.2 {$<$} N\_HI {$<$} 2x10\^20 cm\^-2 are consistent with observations. High-velocity outflows (with radial velocity exceeding the halo circular velocity by a factor {$>\sptilde$}2) tend to have higher metallicities ([X/H] \textasciitilde{} -0.5) while very low metallicity ([X/H] {$<$} -2) LLSs are typically associated with gas infalling from the intergalactic medium. However, most LLSs occupy an intermediate region in metallicity-radial velocity space, for which there is no clear trend between metallicity and radial kinematics. Metal-enriched inflows arise in the FIRE simulations as a result of galactic winds that fall back onto galaxies at low redshift. The overall simulated LLS metallicity distribution has a mean (standard deviation) [X/H] = -0.9 (0.4) and does not show significant evidence for bimodality, in contrast to recent observational studies but consistent with LLSs arising from halos with a broad range of masses and metallicities.},

Uses a [particle-tracking] analysis applied to the [FIRE-2 simulations] to study the [origins of the [CGM]], including [IGM accretion], [galactic wind], and [satellite wind].

Strong [stellar feedback] means only [L* halos] retain {$>\sptilde$}50\% of their [baryon budget].

{$>\sptilde$}60\% of the [metal budget] is retained by halos.

{$>\sptilde$}60\% of the [CGM] originates as [IGM accretion].

\textasciitilde 20-40\% of the [CGM] originates as [galactic wind].

In [L* halos] \textasciitilde 1/4 of the [CGM] originates as [satellite wind].

The [lifetime] for gas in the [CGM] is billions of years, during which time it forms a well-mixed [hot halo].

For [low-redshift] [L* halos] [cool CGM gas] (T {$<$} 1e4.7 K) is distributed on average preferentially along the [galaxy plane], but with strong [halo-to-halo variability].

The [metallicity] of [IGM accretion] is systematically lower than the [metallicity] of [winds] (typically by {$>\sptilde$}1 dex), but metallicities depend significantly on the treatment of [subgrid metal diffusion].

Of the CGM at z = 2, about half is found in the ISM or stars of the central galaxy by z = 0 in Mh(z = 2) ∼ 5 × 1011 M⊙ haloes, but most of the CGM in lower mass haloes ends up in the intergalactic medium (IGM). This is so even though most of the CGM in Mh(z = 2) ∼ 5 × 1010 M⊙ haloes first accretes on to the central galaxy before being ejected into the IGM. On the other hand, most of the CGM mass at z = 0.25 remains in the CGM by z = 0 at all halo masses analysed. Of the CGM gas that subsequently accretes on to the central galaxy in the progenitors of Mh(z = 0) ∼ 1012 M⊙ haloes, most of it is cool (T ∼ 104 K) at z = 2 but hot (∼Tvir) at z ∼ 0.25, consistent with the expected transition from cold mode to hot mode accretion.

  abstract = {The Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project explores the role of feedback in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Previous FIRE simulations used an identical source code (FIRE-1) for consistency. Now, motivated by the development of more accurate numerics (hydrodynamic solvers, gravitational softening, supernova coupling) and the exploration of new physics (e.g. magnetic fields), we introduce FIRE-2, an updated numerical implementation of FIRE physics for the GIZMO code. We run a suite of simulations and show FIRE-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties relative to FIRE-1. We then pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics in galaxy simulations. Details of the star-formation (SF) algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects, provided that we include metal-line cooling and SF occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present several new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are remarkably robust to the numerics that we test, provided that: (1) Toomre masses (cold disk scale heights) are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation and isotropy, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. As resolution increases, stellar masses and profiles converge first, followed by metal abundances and visual morphologies, then properties of winds and the circumgalactic medium. The central (\textasciitilde kpc) mass concentration of massive (L*) galaxies is sensitive to numerics, particularly how winds ejected into hot halos are trapped, mixed, and recycled into the galaxy. Multiple feedback mechanisms are required to reproduce observations: SNe regulate stellar masses; OB/AGB mass loss fuels late-time SF; radiative feedback suppresses instantaneous SFRs and accretion onto dwarfs.

  abstract = {Project AMIGA (Absorption Maps In the Gas of Andromeda) is a large ultraviolet Hubble Space Telescope program, which has assembled a sample of 43 QSOs that pierce the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of Andromeda (M31) from R=25 to 569 kpc (25 of them probing gas from 25 kpc to about the virial radius-Rvir = 300 kpc-of M31). Our large sample provides an unparalleled look at the physical conditions and distribution of metals in the CGM of a single galaxy using ions that probe a wide range of gas phases (Si II, Si III, Si IV, C II, C IV, and O VI, the latter being from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer). We find that Si III and O VI have near unity covering factor maintained all the way out to 1.2Rvir and 1.9Rvir, respectively. We show that Si III is the dominant ion over Si II and Si IV at any R. While we do not find that the properties of the CGM of M31 depend strongly on the azimuth, we show that they change remarkably around 0.3-0.5Rvir, conveying that the inner regions of the CGM of M31 are more dynamic and have more complicated multi-phase gas-structures than at R{$>$}0.5Rvir. We estimate the metal mass of the CGM within Rvir as probed by Si II, Si III, and Si IV is 2x10\^7 Msun and by O VI is {$>$}8x10\^7 Msun, while the baryon mass of the 10\^4-10\^5.5 K gas is \textasciitilde 4x10\^10 (Z/0.3 Zsun)\^(-1) Msun within Rvir. We show that different zoom-in cosmological simulations of L* galaxies better reproduce the column density profile of O VI with R than Si III or the other studied ions. We find that observations of the M31 CGM and zoom-in simulations of L* galaxies have both lower ions showing higher column density dispersion and dependence on R than higher ions, indicating that the higher ionization structures are larger and/or more broadly distributed.},

We find that nearly all metals produced in high-redshift galaxies are carried out in winds that escape the galaxy and reach \$0.25 R\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}\$. When measured at \$0.25 R\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}\$ the metallicity of outflows is greater than, but similar to the ISM metallicity. Many metals thus reside in a reservoir in the CGM. We find that the outflowing flux through \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}\$ is lower than that at \$0.25 R\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}\$ by a factor of \$\textbackslash sim2-5\$. Cooling and recycling from this reservoir determine the metal budget in the ISM. The inflow metallicity at \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}\$ is generally very low, but outflow and inflow metallicities are similar in the inner halo. At low redshift, massive galaxies no longer generate outflows that reach the CGM, causing a divergence in CGM and ISM metallicity. Dwarf galaxies continue to generate outflows, which become increasingly dominated by metal-poor gas, while the galaxies themselves preferentially retains metal ejecta. In all but the least massive galaxy considered, a majority of the metals are within the halo at \$z=0\$. We measure the fraction of metals in CGM, ISM, stars, and roughly quantify the thermal state of CGM metals in each halo. The total amount of metals in the low-redshift CGM of two simulated L* galaxies is consistent with estimates from the COS halos survey, while for the other two it appears to be lower.},

We analyze simulations of low-mass dwarfs, intermediate-mass dwarfs, Milky Way-mass halos, and high-redshift massive halos. Consistent with previous work, we find that dwarfs eject about 100 times more gas from their interstellar medium (ISM) than they form in stars, while this mass "loading factor" drops below one in massive galaxies. Most of the mass is carried by the hot phase (\${$>$}10\^5\$ K) in massive halos and the warm phase (\$10\^3-10\^5\$ K) in dwarfs; cold outflows (\${$<$}10\^3\$ K) are negligible except in high-redshift dwarfs. Energy, momentum and metal loading factors from the ISM are of order unity in dwarfs and significantly lower in more massive halos. Hot outflows have \$2-5\textbackslash times\$ higher specific energy than needed to escape from the gravitational potential of dwarf halos; indeed, in dwarfs, the mass, momentum, and metal outflow rates increase with radius whereas energy is roughly conserved, indicating swept up halo gas. Instantaneous mass loading factors tend to be larger during more powerful starbursts and when the inner halo is not virialized, but we see effectively no trend with the dense ISM gas fraction. We discuss how our results can guide future controlled numerical experiments that aim to elucidate the key parameters governing galactic winds and the resulting preventative feedback.},

In order to constrain the nature of the gas traced by OVI, we analyze additional observables of the outer halo, namely HI to OVI column ratios of 1-10, an absence of low-ion absorption, a mean differential extinction of E(B-V)\textasciitilde 10\^-3, and a linear relation between OVI column and velocity width. We contrast these observations with two physical scenarios: (1) OVI traces high-pressure (\textasciitilde 30 cm\^-3 K) collisionally-ionized gas cooling from a virially-shocked phase, and (2) OVI traces low-pressure ({$<\sptilde$}1 cm\^-3 K) gas beyond the accretion shock, where the gas is in ionization and thermal equilibrium with the UV background. We demonstrate that the high-pressure scenario requires multiple gas phases to explain the observations, and a large deposition of energy at {$>\sptilde$}100 kpc to offset the energy radiated by the cooling gas. In contrast, the low-pressure scenario can explain all considered observations with a single gas phase in thermal equilibrium, provided that the baryon overdensity is comparable to the dark-matter overdensity, and that the gas is enriched to {$>\sptilde$}Z\_sun/3 with an ISM-like dust-to-metal ratio. The low-pressure scenario implies that OVI traces a cool flow with mass flow rate of \textasciitilde 5 M\_sun yr\^-1, comparable to the star formation rate of the central galaxies. The OVI line widths are consistent with the velocity shear expected within this flow. The low-pressure scenario predicts a bimodality in absorption line ratios at \textasciitilde 100 kpc, due to the pressure jump across the accretion shock.},

The properties of our simulated groups, such as baryon fractions, SZ flux, and X-ray luminosities (L\_X), are broadly consistent with existing observations, even though feedback from active galactic nuclei is not included. We make predictions for future observations of lower-mass objects for both SZ and diffuse X-ray measurements, finding that they are not just scaled-down versions of massive galaxies, but more strongly affected by galactic winds driven by star formation. Low-mass haloes ({$<\sptilde$}10\^11 Msun) retain a low fraction of their baryons, which results in a strong suppression of the SZ signal. Our simulations therefore predict a scaling with halo mass that is steeper than self-similar for haloes less massive than 10\^13 Msun. For halo masses {$<\sptilde$}10\^12 Msun, L\_X is time-variable and correlated primarily with the star formation rate (SFR). For these objects, the diffuse X-ray emission is powered mostly by galactic winds and the gas dominating the X-ray emission is flowing out with radial velocities close to the halo's circular velocity. For halo masses {$>\sptilde$}10\^13 Msun, on the other hand, L\_X is much less variable and not correlated with the SFR, because the emission originates from the quasi-hydrostatic, virialized halo gas.},

The chemical evolution of the deuterium abundance that we derive here agrees quantitatively with analytical chemical evolution models. We furthermore find that the relation between the deuterium and oxygen abundance exhibits very little scatter. We compare our simulations to existing high-redshift observations in order to determine a primordial deuterium fraction of 2.549 +/- 0.033 x 10\^-5 and stress that future observations at higher metallicity can also be used to constrain this value. At fixed metallicity, the deuterium fraction decreases slightly with decreasing redshift, due to the increased importance of mass loss from intermediate-mass stars. We find that the evolution of the average deuterium fraction in a galaxy correlates with its star formation history. Our simulations are consistent with observations of the Milky Way's interstellar medium: the deuterium fraction at the solar circle is 85-92 per cent of the primordial deuterium fraction. We use our simulations to make predictions for future observations. In particular, the deuterium abundance is lower at smaller galactocentric radii and in higher mass galaxies, showing that stellar mass loss is more important for fuelling star formation in these regimes (and can even dominate). Gas accreting onto galaxies has a deuterium fraction above that of the galaxies' interstellar medium, but below the primordial fraction, because it is a mix of gas accreting from the intergalactic medium and gas previously ejected or stripped from galaxies.},
