	abstract = {We present an analysis of the flow of metals through the circumgalactic medium in the Feedback in Realistic Environments ({FIRE}) simulations of galaxy formation, ranging from isolated dwarfs to \$L*\$. We find that nearly all metals produced in high-redshift galaxies are carried out in winds that escape the galaxy and reach \$0.25 R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$. When measured at \$0.25 R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$ the metallicity of outflows is greater than, but similar to the {ISM} metallicity. Many metals thus reside in a reservoir in the {CGM}. We find that the outflowing flux through \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$ is lower than that at \$0.25 R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$ by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim2-5\$. Cooling and recycling from this reservoir determine the metal budget in the {ISM}. The inflow metallicity at \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$ is generally very low, but outflow and inflow metallicities are similar in the inner halo. At low redshift, massive galaxies no longer generate outflows that reach the {CGM}, causing a divergence in {CGM} and {ISM} metallicity. Dwarf galaxies continue to generate outflows, which become increasingly dominated by metal-poor gas, while the galaxies themselves preferentially retains metal ejecta. In all but the least massive galaxy considered, a majority of the metals are within the halo at \$z=0\$. We measure the fraction of metals in {CGM}, {ISM}, stars, and roughly quantify the thermal state of {CGM} metals in each halo. The total amount of metals in the low-redshift {CGM} of two simulated L* galaxies is consistent with estimates from the {COS} halos survey, while for the other two it appears to be lower.},

	abstract = {The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ({SZ}) effect and soft X-ray emission are routinely observed around massive galaxies and in galaxy groups and clusters. We study these observational diagnostics of galaxy haloes for a suite of cosmological `zoom-in' simulations from the `Feedback In Realistic Environments' project, which spans a large range in halo mass 10{\textasciicircum}10-10{\textasciicircum}13 Msun). We explore the effect of stellar feedback on the hot gas observables. The properties of our simulated groups, such as baryon fractions, {SZ} flux, and X-ray luminosities (L\_X), are broadly consistent with existing observations, even though feedback from active galactic nuclei is not included. We make predictions for future observations of lower-mass objects for both {SZ} and diffuse X-ray measurements, finding that they are not just scaled-down versions of massive galaxies, but more strongly affected by galactic winds driven by star formation. Low-mass haloes ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun) retain a low fraction of their baryons, which results in a strong suppression of the {SZ} signal. Our simulations therefore predict a scaling with halo mass that is steeper than self-similar for haloes less massive than 10{\textasciicircum}13 Msun. For halo masses {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun, L\_X is time-variable and correlated primarily with the star formation rate ({SFR}). For these objects, the diffuse X-ray emission is powered mostly by galactic winds and the gas dominating the X-ray emission is flowing out with radial velocities close to the halo's circular velocity. For halo masses {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}13 Msun, on the other hand, L\_X is much less variable and not correlated with the {SFR}, because the emission originates from the quasi-hydrostatic, virialized halo gas.},

Our sample ranges from compact, bulge-dominated systems with 90\% of their stellar mass within 2.5 kpc to well-ordered disks that reach \${\textbackslash}gtrsim15\$ kpc. The gas in our galaxies always forms a thin, rotation-supported disk at \$z=0\$, with sizes primarily determined by the gas mass. For stars, we quantify kinematics and morphology both via the fraction of stars on disk-like orbits and with the radial extent of the stellar disk. In this mass range, stellar morphology and kinematics are poorly correlated with the properties of the halo available from dark matter-only simulations (halo merger history, spin, or formation time). They more strongly correlate with the gaseous histories of the galaxies: those that maintain a high gas mass in the disk after \$z{\textbackslash}sim1\$ develop well-ordered stellar disks. The best predictor of morphology we identify is the spin of the gas in the halo at the time the galaxy formed 1/2 of its stars (i.e. the gas that builds the galaxy). High-\$z\$ mergers, before a hot halo emerges, produce some of the most massive bulges in the sample (from compact disks in gas-rich mergers), while later-forming bulges typically originate from internal processes, as satellites are stripped of gas before the galaxies merge. Moreover, most stars in \$z=0\$ {MW}-mass galaxies (even \$z=0\$ bulge stars) form in a disk: \${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$60-90\% of stars begin their lives rotationally supported.},

	abstract = {The Feedback In Realistic Environments ({FIRE}) project explores the role of feedback in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Previous {FIRE} simulations used an identical source code ({FIRE}-1) for consistency. Now, motivated by the development of more accurate numerics (hydrodynamic solvers, gravitational softening, supernova coupling) and the exploration of new physics (e.g. magnetic fields), we introduce {FIRE}-2, an updated numerical implementation of {FIRE} physics for the {GIZMO} code. We run a suite of simulations and show {FIRE}-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties relative to {FIRE}-1. We then pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics in galaxy simulations. Details of the star-formation ({SF}) algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects, provided that we include metal-line cooling and {SF} occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present several new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are remarkably robust to the numerics that we test, provided that: (1) Toomre masses (cold disk scale heights) are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation and isotropy, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. As resolution increases, stellar masses and profiles converge first, followed by metal abundances and visual morphologies, then properties of winds and the circumgalactic medium. The central ({\textasciitilde}kpc) mass concentration of massive (L*) galaxies is sensitive to numerics, particularly how winds ejected into hot halos are trapped, mixed, and recycled into the galaxy. Multiple feedback mechanisms are required to reproduce observations: {SNe} regulate stellar masses; {OB}/{AGB} mass loss fuels late-time {SF}; radiative feedback suppresses instantaneous {SFRs} and accretion onto dwarfs.

At these low redshifts, {LLSs} are closely associated with dense gas structures surrounding galaxies, such as galactic winds, dwarf satellites, and cool inflows from the intergalactic medium. Our analysis is based on 14 zoom-in simulations covering the halo mass range M\_h{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}9-10{\textasciicircum}13 Msun at z=0, which we convolve with the dark matter halo mass function to produce cosmological statistics.

The incidence and {HI} column density distribution of simulated absorbers with columns 10{\textasciicircum}16.2 {\textless} N\_HI {\textless} 2x10{\textasciicircum}20 cm{\textasciicircum}-2 are consistent with observations. High-velocity outflows (with radial velocity exceeding the halo circular velocity by a factor {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}2) tend to have higher metallicities ([X/H] {\textasciitilde} -0.5) while very low metallicity ([X/H] {\textless} -2) {LLSs} are typically associated with gas infalling from the intergalactic medium. However, most {LLSs} occupy an intermediate region in metallicity-radial velocity space, for which there is no clear trend between metallicity and radial kinematics. Metal-enriched inflows arise in the {FIRE} simulations as a result of galactic winds that fall back onto galaxies at low redshift. The overall simulated {LLS} metallicity distribution has a mean (standard deviation) [X/H] = -0.9 (0.4) and does not show significant evidence for bimodality, in contrast to recent observational studies but consistent with {LLSs} arising from halos with a broad range of masses and metallicities.},

Our sample consists of 21 {FIRE}-2 simulations, spanning the halo mass range Mh ∼ 1010–1012 M⊙, and we focus on z = 0.25 and z = 2. Owing to strong stellar feedback, only ∼L⋆ haloes retain a baryon mass \${\textbackslash}gtrsim{\textbackslash}! 50{\textbackslash}hbox\{ per cent\}\$ of their cosmic budget. Metals are more efficiently retained by haloes, with a retention fraction \${\textbackslash}gtrsim{\textbackslash}! 50{\textbackslash}hbox\{ per cent\}\$. Across all masses and redshifts analysed \${\textbackslash}gtrsim {\textbackslash}!60{\textbackslash}hbox\{ per cent\}\$ of the {CGM} mass originates as {IGM} accretion (some of which is associated with infalling haloes). Overall, the second most important contribution is wind from the central galaxy, though gas ejected or stripped from satellites can contribute a comparable mass in ∼L⋆ haloes. Gas can persist in the {CGM} for billions of years, resulting in well mixed-halo gas. Sightlines through the {CGM} are therefore likely to intersect gas of multiple origins. For low-redshift ∼L⋆ haloes, cool gas (T {\textless} 104.7 K) is distributed on average preferentially along the galaxy plane, however with strong halo-to-halo variability. The metallicity of {IGM} accretion is systematically lower than the metallicity of winds (typically by ≳1 dex), although {CGM} and {IGM} metallicities depend significantly on the treatment of subgrid metal diffusion.

	abstract = {Large {OVI} columns are observed around star-forming, low-redshift {\textasciitilde}L* galaxies, with a dependence on impact parameter indicating that most O{\textasciicircum}5+ particles reside beyond half the halo virial radius ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}100 kpc). In order to constrain the nature of the gas traced by {OVI}, we analyze additional observables of the outer halo, namely {HI} to {OVI} column ratios of 1-10, an absence of low-ion absorption, a mean differential extinction of E(B-V){\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}-3, and a linear relation between {OVI} column and velocity width. We contrast these observations with two physical scenarios: (1) {OVI} traces high-pressure ({\textasciitilde}30 cm{\textasciicircum}-3 K) collisionally-ionized gas cooling from a virially-shocked phase, and (2) {OVI} traces low-pressure ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}1 cm{\textasciicircum}-3 K) gas beyond the accretion shock, where the gas is in ionization and thermal equilibrium with the {UV} background. We demonstrate that the high-pressure scenario requires multiple gas phases to explain the observations, and a large deposition of energy at {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}100 kpc to offset the energy radiated by the cooling gas. In contrast, the low-pressure scenario can explain all considered observations with a single gas phase in thermal equilibrium, provided that the baryon overdensity is comparable to the dark-matter overdensity, and that the gas is enriched to {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}Z\_sun/3 with an {ISM}-like dust-to-metal ratio. The low-pressure scenario implies that {OVI} traces a cool flow with mass flow rate of {\textasciitilde}5 M\_sun yr{\textasciicircum}-1, comparable to the star formation rate of the central galaxies. The {OVI} line widths are consistent with the velocity shear expected within this flow. The low-pressure scenario predicts a bimodality in absorption line ratios at {\textasciitilde}100 kpc, due to the pressure jump across the accretion shock.},

	abstract = {We quantify the gas-phase abundance of deuterium and fractional contribution of stellar mass loss to the gas in cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback In Realistic Environments project. At low metallicity, our simulations confirm that the deuterium abundance is very close to the primordial value. The chemical evolution of the deuterium abundance that we derive here agrees quantitatively with analytical chemical evolution models. We furthermore find that the relation between the deuterium and oxygen abundance exhibits very little scatter. We compare our simulations to existing high-redshift observations in order to determine a primordial deuterium fraction of 2.549 +/- 0.033 x 10{\textasciicircum}-5 and stress that future observations at higher metallicity can also be used to constrain this value. At fixed metallicity, the deuterium fraction decreases slightly with decreasing redshift, due to the increased importance of mass loss from intermediate-mass stars. We find that the evolution of the average deuterium fraction in a galaxy correlates with its star formation history. Our simulations are consistent with observations of the Milky Way's interstellar medium: the deuterium fraction at the solar circle is 85-92 per cent of the primordial deuterium fraction. We use our simulations to make predictions for future observations. In particular, the deuterium abundance is lower at smaller galactocentric radii and in higher mass galaxies, showing that stellar mass loss is more important for fuelling star formation in these regimes (and can even dominate). Gas accreting onto galaxies has a deuterium fraction above that of the galaxies' interstellar medium, but below the primordial fraction, because it is a mix of gas accreting from the intergalactic medium and gas previously ejected or stripped from galaxies.},

Our large sample provides an unparalleled look at the physical conditions and distribution of metals in the {CGM} of a single galaxy using ions that probe a wide range of gas phases (Si {II}, Si {III}, Si {IV}, C {II}, C {IV}, and O {VI}, the latter being from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer). We find that Si {III} and O {VI} have near unity covering factor maintained all the way out to 1.2Rvir and 1.9Rvir, respectively. We show that Si {III} is the dominant ion over Si {II} and Si {IV} at any R. While we do not find that the properties of the {CGM} of M31 depend strongly on the azimuth, we show that they change remarkably around 0.3-0.5Rvir, conveying that the inner regions of the {CGM} of M31 are more dynamic and have more complicated multi-phase gas-structures than at R{\textgreater}0.5Rvir. We estimate the metal mass of the {CGM} within Rvir as probed by Si {II}, Si {III}, and Si {IV} is 2x10{\textasciicircum}7 Msun and by O {VI} is {\textgreater}8x10{\textasciicircum}7 Msun, while the baryon mass of the 10{\textasciicircum}4-10{\textasciicircum}5.5 K gas is {\textasciitilde}4x10{\textasciicircum}10 (Z/0.3 Zsun){\textasciicircum}(-1) Msun within Rvir. We show that different zoom-in cosmological simulations of L* galaxies better reproduce the column density profile of O {VI} with R than Si {III} or the other studied ions. We find that observations of the M31 {CGM} and zoom-in simulations of L* galaxies have both lower ions showing higher column density dispersion and dependence on R than higher ions, indicating that the higher ionization structures are larger and/or more broadly distributed.},

	abstract = {We use the {FIRE}-2 cosmological simulations to study the formation of a virial temperature, quasi-static gas phase in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) at redshifts 0{\textless}z{\textless}5, and how the formation of this virialized phase affects the evolution of galactic discs. We demonstrate that when the halo mass crosses {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}12 M\_sun, the cooling time of shocked gas in the inner {CGM} ({\textasciitilde}0.1 R\_vir, where R\_vir is the virial radius) exceeds the local free-fall time. The inner {CGM} then experiences a transition from on average sub-virial temperatures (T{\textless}{\textless}T\_vir), large pressure fluctuations and supersonic inflow/outflow velocities, to virial temperatures (T{\textasciitilde}T\_vir), uniform pressures and subsonic velocities. This transition occurs when the outer {CGM} ({\textasciitilde}0.5 R\_vir) is already subsonic and has a temperature {\textasciitilde}T\_vir, indicating that the longer cooling times at large radii allow the outer {CGM} to virialize at lower halo masses than the inner {CGM}. This outside-in {CGM} virialization scenario is in contrast with inside-out scenarios commonly envisioned based on more idealized simulations. We demonstrate that virialization of the inner {CGM} coincides with abrupt changes in the properties of the central galaxy and its stellar feedback: the galaxy settles into a stable rotating disc, star formation transitions from `bursty' to `steady,' and stellar-driven galaxy-scale outflows are suppressed. Our results hence suggest that {CGM} virialization is initially associated with the formation of rotation-dominated thin galactic discs, rather than with the quenching of star formation as often assumed.},

	abstract = {We examine the thermodynamic state and cooling of the low-\$z\$ Circum-Galactic Medium ({CGM}) in five {FIRE}-2 galaxy formation simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find that the {CGM} in these simulations is generally multiphase and dynamic, with a wide spectrum of largely nonlinear density perturbations sourced by the accretion of gas from the {IGM} and winds from both the central and satellite galaxies. We investigate the origin of the multiphase structure of the {CGM} with a particle tracking analysis and find that most of the low entropy gas has cooled from the hot halo as a result of thermal instability triggered by these perturbations. The ratio of cooling to free-fall timescales \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ in the hot component of the {CGM} spans a wide range \${\textbackslash}sim 1-100\$ at a given radius, but exhibits approximately constant median values \${\textbackslash}sim 5-20\$ at all radii \$0.1 R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\} {\textless} r {\textless} R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$. These are similar to the \${\textbackslash}approx 10-20\$ value typically adopted as the thermal instability threshold in "precipitation" models of the {ICM}. Consequently, a one-dimensional model based on the assumption of a constant \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ and hydrostatic equilibrium approximately reproduces the simulation number density and entropy profiles, but only if it assumes the metallicity profiles taken directly from the simulations. We explicitly show that the \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ value of a gas parcel in the hot component of the {CGM} does not predict its probability of cooling and subsequently accreting onto the central galaxy. This suggests that the value of \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ is a poor predictor of thermal stability in gaseous halos in which large-amplitude density perturbations are prevalent.},

	abstract = {Pressure balance plays a central role in models of the interstellar medium ({ISM}), but whether and how pressure balance is realized in a realistic multiphase {ISM} is not yet well understood. We address this question using a set of {FIRE}-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass disk galaxies, in which a multiphase {ISM} is self-consistently shaped by gravity, cooling, and stellar feedback. We analyze how gravity determines the vertical pressure profile as well as how the total {ISM} pressure is partitioned between different phases and components (thermal, dispersion/turbulence, and bulk flows). We show that, on average and consistent with previous more idealized simulations, the total {ISM} pressure balances the weight of the overlying gas. Deviations from vertical pressure balance increase with increasing galactocentric radius and with decreasing averaging scale. The different phases are in rough total pressure equilibrium with one another, but with large deviations from thermal pressure equilibrium owing to kinetic support in the cold and warm phases, which dominate the total pressure near the midplane. Bulk flows (e.g., inflows and fountains) are important at a few disk scale heights, while thermal pressure from hot gas dominates at larger heights. Overall, the total midplane pressure is well-predicted by the weight of the disk gas, and we show that it also scales linearly with the star formation rate surface density (Sigma\_SFR). These results support the notion that the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation arises because Sigma\_SFR and the gas surface density (Sigma\_g) are connected via the {ISM} midplane pressure.},

Most of the mass is carried by the hot phase (\${\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}5\$ K) in massive halos and the warm phase (\$10{\textasciicircum}3-10{\textasciicircum}5\$ K) in dwarfs; cold outflows (\${\textless}10{\textasciicircum}3\$ K) are negligible except in high-redshift dwarfs. Energy, momentum and metal loading factors from the {ISM} are of order unity in dwarfs and significantly lower in more massive halos. Hot outflows have \$2-5{\textbackslash}times\$ higher specific energy than needed to escape from the gravitational potential of dwarf halos; indeed, in dwarfs, the mass, momentum, and metal outflow rates increase with radius whereas energy is roughly conserved, indicating swept up halo gas. Instantaneous mass loading factors tend to be larger during more powerful starbursts and when the inner halo is not virialized, but we see effectively no trend with the dense {ISM} gas fraction. We discuss how our results can guide future controlled numerical experiments that aim to elucidate the key parameters governing galactic winds and the resulting preventative feedback.},
