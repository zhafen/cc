	abstract = {We present the first results from an ongoing survey for damped Lyman-α systems ({DLAs}) in the spectra of z {\textgreater} 2 quasars observed in the course of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey ({BOSS}), which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS}) {III}. Our full (non-statistical) sample, based on Data Release 9, comprises 12 081 systems with log N(H i) ≥ 20, out of which 6839 have log N(H i) ≥ 20.3. This is the largest {DLA} sample ever compiled, superseding that from {SDSS}-{II} by a factor of seven. Using a statistical sub-sample and estimating systematics from realistic mock data, we probe the N(H i) distribution at ⟨z⟩ = 2.5. Contrary to what is generally{\textbackslash}nbelieved, the distribution extends beyond 1022{\textbackslash}ncm-2 with a moderate slope of index ≈-3.5. This result matches the opacity-corrected distribution observed at z = 0 surprisingly well. The cosmological mass density of neutral gas in {DLAs} is found to be ωgdla ≈ 10-3, evolving only mildly over the past 12 billion years.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}{nTable} 3 is only available at the {CDS} via anonymous ftp to{\textbackslash}ncdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/547/L1},

	abstract = {We present the methodology for, and the first results from, a new imaging programme aimed at identifying and characterizing the host galaxies of damped Lyman α absorbers ({DLAs}) at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 2. We target quasar sightlines with multiple optically thick {HI} absorbers and use the higher redshift system as a `blocking filter' (via its Lyman-limit absorption) to eliminate all far-ultraviolet ({FUV}) emission from the quasar. This allows us to directly image the rest-frame {FUV} continuum emission of the lower redshift {DLA}, without any quasar contamination and with no bias towards large impact parameters. We introduce a formalism based on galaxy number counts and Bayesian statistics with which we quantify the probability that a candidate is the {DLA} host galaxy. This method will allow the identification of a bona fide sample of {DLAs} that are too faint to be spectroscopically confirmed. The same formalism can be adopted to the study of other quasar absorption-line systems (e.g. {MgII} absorbers). We have applied this imaging technique to two quasi-stellar object sightlines. For the z {\textasciitilde} 2.69 {DLA} towards J073149+285449, a galaxy with impact parameter b = 1.54arcsec = 11.89h-172kpc and an implied star formation rate ({SFR}) of {\textasciitilde}5h-272Msolaryr-1 is identified as the most reliable candidate. In the case of the z {\textasciitilde} 2.92 {DLA} towards J211444-005533, no likely host is found down to a 3σ {SFR} limit of 1.4h-272Msolaryr-1. Studying the {HI} column density as a function of the impact parameter, including six {DLAs} with known hosts from the literature, we find evidence that the observed {HI} distribution is more extended than what is generally predicted from numerical simulation. Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. E-mail: mfumagalli@ucolick.org ‡ Ramanujan Fellow.},
