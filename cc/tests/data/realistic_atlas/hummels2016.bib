	abstract = {Hydrodynamical simulations are increasingly able to accurately model physical systems on stellar, galactic, and cosmological scales, however, the utility of these simulations is often limited by our ability to directly compare them with the datasets produced by observers: spectra, photometry, etc. To address this problem, we have created Trident\}, a Python-based, open-source tool for post-processing hydrodynamical simulations to produce synthetic absorption spectra and related data. Trident\} can (i) create absorption-line spectra for any trajectory through a simulated dataset mimicking both background quasar and down-the-barrel configurations, (ii) reproduce the spectral characteristics of common instruments like the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, (iii) operate across the ultraviolet, optical and infrared using customizable absorption line lists, (iv) trace simulated physical structures directly to spectral features, (v) approximate the presence of ion species absent from the simulation outputs, (vi) generate column density maps for any ion, and (vii) provide support for all major astrophysical hydrodynamical codes. The focus of Trident's development is for using simulated datasets to better interpret observations of the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) and intergalactic medium ({IGM}), but it remains a general tool applicable in other contexts.},

	title = {The {SAMI} Galaxy Survey: Exploring the gas-phase Mass-Metallicity Relation},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11263},
	abstract = {We present a detailed exploration of the stellar mass vs. gas-phase metallicity relation ({MZR}) using integral field spectroscopy data obtained from {\textasciitilde}1000 galaxies observed by the {SAMI} Galaxy survey. These spatially resolved spectroscopic data allow us to determine the metallicity within the same physical scale (Reff) for different calibrators. The shape of the {MZ} relations is very similar between the different calibrators, while there are large offsets in the absolute values of the abundances. We confirm our previous results derived using the spatially resolved data provided by the {CALIFA} and {MaNGA} surveys: (1) we do not find any significant secondary relation of the {MZR} with either the star formation rate ({SFR}) nor the specific {SFR} ({SFR}/Mass) for any of the calibrators used in this study, based on the analysis of the \{individual\} residuals, (2) if there is a dependence with the {SFR}, it is weaker than the reported one (\$r\_c{\textbackslash}sim -\$0.3), it is confined to the low mass regime (M*{\textless}10\${\textasciicircum}9\$Msun) or high {SFR} regimes, and it does not produce any significant improvement in the \{description of the average population of galaxies. The aparent disagreement with published results based on single fiber spectroscopic data could be due to (i) the interpretation of the secondary relation itself, (ii) the lower number of objects sampled at the low mass regime by the current study, or (iii) the presence of extreme star-forming galaxies that drive the secondary relation in previous results},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the galaxy-scale gaseous outflows from the {FIRE} (Feedback in Realistic Environments) simulations. This suite of hydrodynamic cosmological zoom simulations provides a sample of halos where star-forming giant molecular clouds are resolved to z=0, and features an explicit stellar feedback model on small scales. In this work, we focus on quantifying the gas mass ejected out of galaxies in winds and how this material travels through the halo. We correlate these quantities to star formation in galaxies throughout cosmic history. Our simulations reveal that a significant portion of every galaxy's evolution, particularly at high redshift, is dominated by bursts of star formation, which are followed by powerful gusts of galactic outflow that sweep up a large fraction of gas in the interstellar medium and send it through the circumgalactic medium. The dynamical effect of these outflows can significantly limit the amount of star formation within the affected galaxy. At low redshift, however, sufficiently massive galaxies corresponding to L*-progenitors develop stable disks and switch into a continuous and quiescent mode of star formation that does not drive outflows into the halo. We find inflow to be more continuous than outflow, although filamentary accretion onto the galaxy can be temporarily disrupted by recently ejected outflows. Using a variety of techniques, we measure outflow rates and use them to derive mass-loading factors, and their dependence on circular velocity, halo mass, and stellar mass for a large sample of galaxies in the {FIRE} simulation suite, spanning four decades in halo mass, six decades in stellar mass, and a redshift range of 4.0 {\textgreater} z {\textgreater} 0. Mass-loading factors for L*-progenitors are eta {\textasciitilde}= 10 at high redshift, but decrease to eta {\textless}{\textless} 1 at low redshift. [continued in text]},
