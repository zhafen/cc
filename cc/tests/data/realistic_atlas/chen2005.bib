	abstract = {The {HI} column density distribution function of {QSO} absorption line systems is inverstigated using recent data with high spectral resolution, and extensive surveys of the Lyman-limit systems and damped Lyman-alpha systems. The hypthesis is that differential distribution function is fitetd by a single power law is rejected at the 99 per cent confidence level. A double power law with a break at N({HI}) = 10{\textasciicircum}16/cm2 also provides a poor fit over the range in which the sample is complete. Whilst there are discontinuities in the distribution there is a clear flattening at N({HI}) = 10{\textasciicircum}16/cm2 , compared to lower column densities. The observed features can be understood using models of photoionized clouds which are confined by an external pressure with density profiles governed by gravity. In particular the flattening can be explained in terms of a transition between metal-poor and metal-rich systems.},
