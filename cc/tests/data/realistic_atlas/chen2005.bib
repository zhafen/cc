	abstract = {We present the results from a damped Lyα survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Data Release 3. We have discovered over 500 new damped Lyα systems at z{\textgreater}2.2, and the complete statistical sample for z{\textgreater}1.6 has more than 600 damped Lyα galaxies. We measure the H I column density distribution {fHI}(N, X) and its zeroth and first moments (the incidence {lDLA} and gas mass density Ω{DLAg} of damped Lyα systems, respectively) as a function of redshift. The key results include: (1) the full {SDSS} {DR}3 {fHI}(N, X) distribution (z{\textasciitilde}3.06) is well fit by a Γ function (or double power law) with ``break'' column density Nγ=1021.5+/-0.1 cm-2 and ``faint-end'' slope α=-1.8+/-0.1 (2) the shape of the {fHI}(N, X) distributions in a series of redshift bins does not show evolution; (3) the incidence and gas mass density of damped systems decrease by 35\%+/-9\% and 50\%+/-10\% during {\textasciitilde}1 Gyr between the redshift intervals z=[3.0, 3.5] and z=[2.2, 2.5] and (4) the incidence and gas mass density of damped Lyα systems in the lowest {SDSS} redshift bin (z=2.2) are consistent with the current values. We investigate a number of systematic errors in damped Lyα analysis and identify only one important effect: we measure 40\%+/-20\% higher Ω{DLAg} values toward a subset of brighter quasars than toward a faint subset. This effect is contrary to the bias associated with dust obscuration and suggests that gravitational lensing may be important. Comparing the results against several models of galaxy formation in Λ{CDM}, we find that all of the models significantly underpredict {lDLA} at z=3, and only {SPH} models with significant feedback can reproduce Ω{DLAg} at high redshift. Based on our results for the damped Lyα systems, we argue that the Lyman limit systems contribute {\textasciitilde}33\% of the universe's H I atoms at all redshifts z=2-5. Furthermore, we infer that the {fHI}(N, X) distribution for {NHI}{\textless}1020 cm-2 has an inflection with slope dlogf/{dlogN}{\textgreater}-1. We advocate a new mass density definition, the mass density of predominantly neutral gas Ωneutg, to be contrasted with the mass density of gas associated with H I atoms. We contend the damped Lyα systems contribute {\textgreater}80\% of Ωneutg at all redshifts and therefore are the main reservoirs for star formation.},

	abstract = {The {HI} column density distribution function of {QSO} absorption line systems is inverstigated using recent data with high spectral resolution, and extensive surveys of the Lyman-limit systems and damped Lyman-alpha systems. The hypthesis is that differential distribution function is fitetd by a single power law is rejected at the 99 per cent confidence level. A double power law with a break at N({HI}) = 10{\textasciicircum}16/cm2 also provides a poor fit over the range in which the sample is complete. Whilst there are discontinuities in the distribution there is a clear flattening at N({HI}) = 10{\textasciicircum}16/cm2 , compared to lower column densities. The observed features can be understood using models of photoionized clouds which are confined by an external pressure with density profiles governed by gravity. In particular the flattening can be explained in terms of a transition between metal-poor and metal-rich systems.},
