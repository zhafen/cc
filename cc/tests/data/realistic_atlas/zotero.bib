	abstract = {Theoretical models of galaxy formation predict that galaxies acquire most of their baryons via cold mode accretion. Observations of high-redshift galaxies, while showing ubiquitous outflows, have so far not revealed convincing traces of the predicted cold streams, which has been interpreted as a challenge for the current models. Using high-resolution, zoom-in smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations of Lyman break galaxy ({LBG}) halos combined with ionizing radiative transfer, we quantify the covering factor of the cold streams at z=2-4. We focus specifically on Lyman limit systems ({LLSs}) and damped Ly-alpha absorbers ({DLAs}), which can be probed by absorption spectroscopy using a background galaxy or quasar sightline, and which are closely related to low-ionization metal absorbers. We show that the covering factor of these systems is relatively small and decreases with time. At z=2, the covering factor of {DLAs} within the virial radius of the simulated galaxies is {\textasciitilde}3\% ({\textasciitilde}1\% within twice this projected distance), and arises principally from the galaxy itself. The corresponding values for {LLSs} are {\textasciitilde}10\% and {\textasciitilde}4\%. Because of their small covering factor compared to the order unity covering fraction expected for galactic winds, the cold streams are naturally dominated by outflows in stacked spectra. We conclude that the existing observations are consistent with the predictions of cold mode accretion, and outline promising kinematic and chemical diagnostics to separate out the signatures of galactic accretion and feedback.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the galaxy-scale gaseous outflows from the {FIRE} (Feedback in Realistic Environments) simulations. This suite of hydrodynamic cosmological zoom simulations provides a sample of halos where star-forming giant molecular clouds are resolved to z=0, and features an explicit stellar feedback model on small scales. In this work, we focus on quantifying the gas mass ejected out of galaxies in winds and how this material travels through the halo. We correlate these quantities to star formation in galaxies throughout cosmic history. Our simulations reveal that a significant portion of every galaxy's evolution, particularly at high redshift, is dominated by bursts of star formation, which are followed by powerful gusts of galactic outflow that sweep up a large fraction of gas in the interstellar medium and send it through the circumgalactic medium. The dynamical effect of these outflows can significantly limit the amount of star formation within the affected galaxy. At low redshift, however, sufficiently massive galaxies corresponding to L*-progenitors develop stable disks and switch into a continuous and quiescent mode of star formation that does not drive outflows into the halo. We find inflow to be more continuous than outflow, although filamentary accretion onto the galaxy can be temporarily disrupted by recently ejected outflows. Using a variety of techniques, we measure outflow rates and use them to derive mass-loading factors, and their dependence on circular velocity, halo mass, and stellar mass for a large sample of galaxies in the {FIRE} simulation suite, spanning four decades in halo mass, six decades in stellar mass, and a redshift range of 4.0 {\textgreater} z {\textgreater} 0. Mass-loading factors for L*-progenitors are eta {\textasciitilde}= 10 at high redshift, but decrease to eta {\textless}{\textless} 1 at low redshift. [continued in text]},

	abstract = {We study the properties of gas inside and around galaxy haloes as a function of radius and halo mass, focusing mostly on z= 2, but also showing some results for z= 0. For this purpose, we use a suite of large cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the {OverWhelmingly} Large Simulations project. The properties of cold- and hot-mode gas, which we separate depending on whether the temperature has been higher than 105.5 K while it was extragalactic, are clearly distinguishable in the outer parts of massive haloes (virial temperatures ≫105 K). The differences between cold- and hot-mode gas resemble those between inflowing and outflowing gas. The cold-mode gas is mostly confined to clumpy filaments that are approximately in pressure equilibrium with the diffuse, hot-mode gas. Besides being colder and denser, cold-mode gas typically has a much lower metallicity and is much more likely to be infalling. However, the spread in the properties of the gas is large, even for a given mode and a fixed radius and halo mass, which makes it impossible to make strong statements about individual gas clouds. Metal-line cooling causes a strong cooling flow near the central galaxy, which makes it hard to distinguish gas accreted through the cold and hot modes in the inner halo. Stronger feedback results in larger outflow velocities and pushes hot-mode gas to larger radii. The gas properties evolve as expected from virial arguments, which can also account for the dependence of many gas properties on halo mass. We argue that cold streams penetrating hot haloes are observable as high column density H I Lyman α absorption systems in sightlines near massive foreground galaxies.},

This contribution briefly summarizes how these studies reveal a widespread metal pollution in the intergalactic medium with a median abundance [C/H] {\textasciitilde} -3.5 at z{\textasciitilde}3 that is increasing by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2-3 from z{\textasciitilde}4.3 to z{\textasciitilde}2.4. At the higher densities that are typical of galactic halos, observations uncover a metallicity spread of five orders of magnitude in Lyman limit systems, ranging from super-solar ([M/H]{\textasciitilde}+0.7) to pristine ([M/H]{\textless} -4) gas clouds. Finally, the neutral damped Ly-alpha systems are enriched to a median metallicity of [M/H] {\textasciitilde} -1.5 that slowly declines with redshift up to z {\textasciitilde} 4.5, at which point it appears to more rapidly evolve as one approaches the end of reionization.},

	abstract = {We present the results from a damped Lyα survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Data Release 3. We have discovered over 500 new damped Lyα systems at z{\textgreater}2.2, and the complete statistical sample for z{\textgreater}1.6 has more than 600 damped Lyα galaxies. We measure the H I column density distribution {fHI}(N, X) and its zeroth and first moments (the incidence {lDLA} and gas mass density Ω{DLAg} of damped Lyα systems, respectively) as a function of redshift. The key results include: (1) the full {SDSS} {DR}3 {fHI}(N, X) distribution (z{\textasciitilde}3.06) is well fit by a Γ function (or double power law) with ``break'' column density Nγ=1021.5+/-0.1 cm-2 and ``faint-end'' slope α=-1.8+/-0.1 (2) the shape of the {fHI}(N, X) distributions in a series of redshift bins does not show evolution; (3) the incidence and gas mass density of damped systems decrease by 35\%+/-9\% and 50\%+/-10\% during {\textasciitilde}1 Gyr between the redshift intervals z=[3.0, 3.5] and z=[2.2, 2.5] and (4) the incidence and gas mass density of damped Lyα systems in the lowest {SDSS} redshift bin (z=2.2) are consistent with the current values. We investigate a number of systematic errors in damped Lyα analysis and identify only one important effect: we measure 40\%+/-20\% higher Ω{DLAg} values toward a subset of brighter quasars than toward a faint subset. This effect is contrary to the bias associated with dust obscuration and suggests that gravitational lensing may be important. Comparing the results against several models of galaxy formation in Λ{CDM}, we find that all of the models significantly underpredict {lDLA} at z=3, and only {SPH} models with significant feedback can reproduce Ω{DLAg} at high redshift. Based on our results for the damped Lyα systems, we argue that the Lyman limit systems contribute {\textasciitilde}33\% of the universe's H I atoms at all redshifts z=2-5. Furthermore, we infer that the {fHI}(N, X) distribution for {NHI}{\textless}1020 cm-2 has an inflection with slope dlogf/{dlogN}{\textgreater}-1. We advocate a new mass density definition, the mass density of predominantly neutral gas Ωneutg, to be contrasted with the mass density of gas associated with H I atoms. We contend the damped Lyα systems contribute {\textgreater}80\% of Ωneutg at all redshifts and therefore are the main reservoirs for star formation.},

A double power law with a break at N({HI}) = 10{\textasciicircum}16/cm2 also provides a poor fit over the range in which the sample is complete. Whilst there are discontinuities in the distribution there is a clear flattening at N({HI}) = 10{\textasciicircum}16/cm2 , compared to lower column densities. The observed features can be understood using models of photoionized clouds which are confined by an external pressure with density profiles governed by gravity. In particular the flattening can be explained in terms of a transition between metal-poor and metal-rich systems.},

	abstract = {We analyze circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) in a suite of high-resolution cosmological re-simulations of a Milky-Way size galaxy and show that {CGM} properties are quite sensitive to details of star formation--feedback loop modelling. The simulation that produces a realistic late-type galaxy, fails to reproduce existing observations of the {CGM}. In contrast, simulation that does not produce a realistic galaxy has the predicted {CGM} in better agreement with observations. This illustrates that properties of galaxies and properties of their {CGM} provide strong \$\{{\textbackslash}it complementary\}\$ constraints on the processes governing galaxy formation. Our simulations predict that column density profiles of ions are well described by an exponential function of projected distance \$d\$: \$N {\textbackslash}propto e{\textasciicircum}\{-d/h\_s\}\$. Simulations thus indicate that the sharp drop in absorber detections at larger distances in observations does not correspond to a "boundary" of an ion, but reflects the underlying steep exponential column density profile. Furthermore, we find that ionization energy of ions is tightly correlated with the scale height \$h\_s\$: \$h\_s {\textbackslash}propto E\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ion\}{\textasciicircum}\{0.74\}\$. At \$z {\textbackslash}approx 0\$, warm gas traced by low-ionization species (e.g., Mg {II} and C {IV}) has \$ h\_s {\textbackslash}approx 0.03-0.07 R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$, while higher ionization species (O {VI} and Ne {VIII}) have \$h\_s {\textbackslash}approx 0.32-0.45R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$. Finally, the scale heights of ions in our simulations evolve slower than the virial radius for \$z{\textbackslash}leq 2\$, but similarly to the halo scale radius, \$r\_s\$. Thus, we suggest that the column density profiles of galaxies at different redshifts should be scaled by \$r\_s\$ rather than the halo virial radius.},

The overall cosmological evolution of Omega({HI}) shows a peak around this redshift. The H I column density distribution for log N(H I) {\textgreater}= 20.3 is fitted, consistent with previous surveys, with a single power-law of index alpha similar to -1.8 +/- 0.25.

We target quasar sightlines with multiple optically thick {HI} absorbers and use the higher redshift system as a `blocking filter' (via its Lyman-limit absorption) to eliminate all far-ultraviolet ({FUV}) emission from the quasar. This allows us to directly image the rest-frame {FUV} continuum emission of the lower redshift {DLA}, without any quasar contamination and with no bias towards large impact parameters. We introduce a formalism based on galaxy number counts and Bayesian statistics with which we quantify the probability that a candidate is the {DLA} host galaxy. This method will allow the identification of a bona fide sample of {DLAs} that are too faint to be spectroscopically confirmed. The same formalism can be adopted to the study of other quasar absorption-line systems (e.g. {MgII} absorbers). We have applied this imaging technique to two quasi-stellar object sightlines. For the z {\textasciitilde} 2.69 {DLA} towards J073149+285449, a galaxy with impact parameter b = 1.54arcsec = 11.89h-172kpc and an implied star formation rate ({SFR}) of {\textasciitilde}5h-272Msolaryr-1 is identified as the most reliable candidate. In the case of the z {\textasciitilde} 2.92 {DLA} towards J211444-005533, no likely host is found down to a 3σ {SFR} limit of 1.4h-272Msolaryr-1. Studying the {HI} column density as a function of the impact parameter, including six {DLAs} with known hosts from the literature, we find evidence that the observed {HI} distribution is more extended than what is generally predicted from numerical simulation. Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

We find that the shape of the dwarf galaxy f({NHi}) is significantly different from the f({NHi}) for high-redshift damped Lyman α absorbers ({DLAs}) or the f({NHi}) for a representative sample of z = 0 gas-rich galaxies. The dwarf f({NHi}) falls much more steeply at high H i column densities as compared to the other determinations. While ˜10 per cent of the cross-section above {NHi} = 1020.3 atoms cm-2 at z = 0 is provided by dwarf galaxies, the fraction falls to ≲1 per cent by {NHi} ˜ 1021.5 atoms cm-2. In the local universe, the contribution to the high {NHi} end of the f({NHi}) distribution comes predominantly from the inclined discs of large galaxies. Dwarf galaxies, both because of their smaller scalelengths and their larger intrinsic axial ratios, do not produce large H i column densities even when viewed edge-on. If high-column-density {DLAs}/Gamma Ray Burst ({GRB}) hosts correspond to galaxies like the local dwarfs, this would require that either (i) the absorption arises from merging and not isolated systems or (ii) the observed lines of sight are strongly biased towards high-column-density regions.},

We select absorbers optically thick at the Lyman limit (\{{\textbackslash}tau\}{LL} {\textgreater} 1, log N({HI}) {\textgreater} 17.3) as probes of these galaxies and their {CGM} where both transitions of the O {VI} doublet have little contamination from the Ly \{{\textbackslash}alpha\}, \{{\textbackslash}beta\} forests. We found 20 absorbers that satisfy these rules: 7 Lyman limit systems ({LLSs}), 8 super-{LLSs} ({SLLSs}) and 5 damped Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} ({DLAs}). The O {VI} detection rate is 100\% for the {DLAs}, 71\% for the {LLSs}, and 63\% for the {SLLSs}. When O {VI} is detected, log N({OVI})=14.9+/-0.3, an average O {VI} column density substantially larger and with a smaller dispersion than found in blind O {VI} surveys at similar redshifts. Strong O {VI} absorption is therefore nearly ubiquitous in the {CGM} of z{\textasciitilde}2-3 galaxies. The total velocity widths of the O {VI} profiles are also large (200{\textless}Dv({OVI}){\textless}400 km/s). These properties are quite similar to those seen for O {VI} in low z star-forming galaxies, and therefore we hypothesize that these strong {CGM} O {VI} absorbers (with \{{\textbackslash}tau\}{LL} {\textgreater} 1) at 2{\textless}z{\textless}3.5 also probe outflows of star-forming galaxies. The {LLSs} and {SLLSs} with no O {VI} absorption have properties consistent with those seen in cosmological simulations tracing cold streams feeding galaxies. When the highly ionized (Si {IV} and O {VI}) gas is taken into account, we determine that the \{{\textbackslash}tau\}{LL} {\textgreater} 1 absorbers could contain as much as 3-14\% of the cosmic baryon budget at z{\textasciitilde}2-3, only second to the Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} forest. We conservatively show that 5-20\% of the metals ever produced at z{\textasciitilde}2-3 are in form of highly ionized metals ejected in the {CGM} of galaxies.},

Our simulations include fully explicit treatment of both the multi-phase {ISM} (molecular through hot) and stellar feedback. The stellar feedback inputs (energy, momentum, mass, and metal fluxes) are taken directly from stellar population models. These sources of stellar feedback, with zero adjusted parameters, reproduce the observed relation between stellar and halo mass up to M\_halo{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}12 M\_sun (including dwarfs, satellites, {MW}-mass disks, and small groups). By extension, this leads to reasonable agreement with the stellar mass function for M\_star{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}11 M\_sun. We predict weak redshift evolution in the M\_star-M\_halo relation, consistent with current constraints to z{\textgreater}6. We find that the M\_star-M\_halo relation is insensitive to numerical details, but is sensitive to the feedback physics. Simulations with only supernova feedback fail to reproduce the observed stellar masses, particularly in dwarf and high-redshift galaxies: radiative feedback (photo-heating and radiation pressure) is necessary to disrupt {GMCs} and enable efficient coupling of later supernovae to the gas. Star formation rates agree well with the observed Kennicutt relation at all redshifts. The galaxy-averaged Kennicutt relation is very different from the numerically imposed law for converting gas into stars in the simulation, and is instead determined by self-regulation via stellar feedback. Feedback reduces star formation rates considerably and produces a reservoir of gas that leads to rising late-time star formation histories significantly different from the halo accretion history. Feedback also produces large short-timescale variability in galactic {SFRs}, especially in dwarfs. Many of these properties are not captured by common 'sub-grid' galactic wind models.},

Our halo catalogue data span a redshift range of z = 0-30, allowing us to probe the mass function from the Dark Ages to the present. We utilize both the friends-of-friends ({FOF}) and spherical overdensity ({SO}) halo-finding methods to directly compare the mass function derived using these commonly used halo definitions. The mass function from {SO} haloes exhibits a clear evolution with redshift, especially during the recent era of dark energy dominance (z {\textless} 1). We provide a redshift-parametrized fit for the {SO} mass function valid for the entire redshift range to within ˜20 per cent as well as a scheme to calculate the mass function for haloes with arbitrary overdensities. The {FOF} mass function displays a weaker evolution with redshift. We provide a `universal' fit for the {FOF} mass function, fitted to data across the entire redshift range simultaneously, and observe redshift evolution in our data versus this fit. The relative evolution of the mass functions derived via the two methods is compared. For an {SO} halo defined via an overdensity of 178 versus the background matter density and an {FOF} halo defined via a linking length of 0.2 times the mean interparticle separation we find that the mass functions most closely match at z = 0. The disparity at z = 0 between the {FOF} and {SO} mass functions resides in their high-mass tails where the collapsed fraction of mass in {SO} haloes is ˜80 per cent of that in {FOF} haloes. This difference grows with redshift so that, by z {\textgreater} 20, the {SO} algorithm finds a ˜50-80 per cent lower collapsed fraction in high-mass haloes than the {FOF} algorithm.},

The {FIRE} simulations incorporate explicit stellar feedback within the multi-phase {ISM}. We find that stellar feedback, without any "fine-tuned" parameters, can greatly alleviate small-scale problems in {CDM}. Feedback causes bursts of star formation and outflows, altering the {DM} distribution. As a result, the inner slope of the {DM} halo profile "alpha" shows a strong mass dependence: profiles are shallow at M\_h {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}10-10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun and steepen at higher/lower masses. The resulting core sizes and slopes are consistent with observations. This is broadly consistent with previous work using simpler feedback schemes, but we find steeper mass dependence of "alpha," and relatively late growth of cores. Because the star formation efficiency is strongly halo mass dependent, a rapid change in the central slope occurs at M\_h {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun, as sufficient feedback energy becomes available to perturb the {DM}. We show that large cores are not established during the period of rapid growth of halos because of ongoing {DM} mass accumulation. Instead, cores require several bursts of star formation after the rapid buildup has completed. The same effects dramatically reduce circular velocities in the inner kpc of massive dwarfs; this could be sufficient to explain the "Too Big To Fail" problem without invoking non-standard {DM}. Finally, we study baryonic contraction in Milky Way-mass halos. The net result of stellar feedback and baryonic contraction is to produce {DM} profiles slightly shallower than the {NFW} profile, as required by the normalization of the Tully-Fisher relation.},

	abstract = {The cosmic web defines the large scale distribution of matter we see in the Universe today. Classifying the cosmic web into voids, sheets, filaments and nodes allows one to explore structure formation and the role environmental factors have on halo and galaxy properties. While existing studies of cosmic web classification concentrate on grid based methods, this work explores a Lagrangian approach where the V-web algorithm proposed by Hoffman et al. (2012) is implemented with techniques borrowed from smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The Lagrangian approach allows one to classify individual objects (e.g. particles or halos) based on properties of their nearest neighbours in an adaptive manner. It can be applied directly to a halo sample which dramatically reduces computational cost and potentially allows an application of this classification scheme to observed galaxy samples. Finally, the Lagrangian nature admits a straight forward inclusion of the Hubble flow negating the necessity of a visually defined threshold value which is commonly employed by grid based classification methods.},

The following physical picture of {mpDLAs} emerges. The majority of {mpDLAs} inhabit regions \${\textbackslash}ge 20\${\textasciitilde}kpc from the host galaxy center on infalling cold gas streams originating from the intergalactic medium, with infall velocity of \${\textbackslash}sim 100\$ km/s and temperature of \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{4\}\$ K. For each host galaxy, on average, about \$1{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the area within a radius \$150\${\textasciitilde}kpc is covered by {mpDLAs}. The {mpDLAs} are relatively diffuse (\$n\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{gas\}\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$), Jeans quasi-stable, and have very low star formation rate (\${\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}Sigma\} {\textbackslash}le 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\} {\textbackslash}msun {\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash} yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash} kpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$). As {mpDLAs} migrate inward to the galaxy center, they mix with high metallicity gas and stellar outflows in the process, removing themselves from the metal-poor category and rendering the central (\${\textbackslash}le 5\$ kpc) regions of galaxies devoid of {mpDLAs}. Thus, the central regions of the host galaxies are populated by mostly metal-rich {DLAs} instead of {mpDLAs}. All observables of the simulated {mpDLAs} are in excellent agreement with observations, except the gas density, which is about a factor of ten lower than the value inferred observationally. However, the observationally inferred value is based on simplified assumptions that are not borne out in the simulations.},

Using a set of high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations of galaxies at z=2, we generate Halpha emission line profiles, taking into account the temperature-dependent Halpha emissivity, as well as dust extinction. The lines can be described as a sum of two gaussians, as typically done with observations. In general, its properties are in good agreement with those observed in local isolated galaxies with similar masses and star formation rates. Blueshifted outflows are very common in the sample. They extend several kpc above the galaxy discs. They are also spread over the full extent of the discs. However, at small radii, the material with high velocities tends to remain confined within a thick disc, as part of galactic fountains or a turbulent medium, most probably due to the deeper gravitational potential at the galaxy center.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05968},
	abstract = {We present Herschel observations of 22 radio galaxies, selected for the presence of shocked, warm molecular hydrogen emission. We measured and modeled spectral energy distributions ({SEDs}) in 33 bands from the ultraviolet to the far-infrared to investigate the impact of jet feedback on star formation activity. These galaxies are massive, early-type galaxies with normal gas-to-dust ratios, covering a range of optical and {IR} colors. We find that the star formation rate ({SFR}) is suppressed by a factor of {\textasciitilde}3-6, depending on how molecular gas mass is estimated. We suggest this suppression is due to the shocks driven by the radio jets injecting turbulence into the interstellar medium ({ISM}), which also powers the luminous warm H2 line emission. Approximately 25\% of the sample shows suppression by more than a factor of 10. However, the degree of {SFR} suppression does not correlate with indicators of jet feedback including jet power, diffuse X-ray emission, or intensity of warm molecular H2 emission, suggesting that while injected turbulence likely impacts star formation, the process is not purely parametrized by the amount of mechanical energy dissipated into the {ISM}. Radio galaxies with shocked warm molecular gas cover a wide range in {SFR}-stellar mass space, indicating that these galaxies are in a variety of evolutionary states, from actively star-forming and gas-rich to quiescent and gas-poor. {SFR} suppression appears to have the biggest impact on the evolution of galaxies that are moderately gas-rich.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06958},
	abstract = {This paper develops constraints on the values of the fundamental constants that allow universes to be habitable. We focus on the fine structure constant \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and the gravitational structure constant \${\textbackslash}alpha\_G\$, and find the region in the \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-\${\textbackslash}alpha\_G\$ plane that supports working stars and habitable planets. This work is motivated, in part, by the possibility that different versions of the laws of physics could be realized within other universes. The following constraints are enforced: [A] long-lived stable nuclear burning stars exist, [B] planetary surface temperatures are hot enough to support chemical reactions, [C] stellar lifetimes are long enough to allow biological evolution, [D] planets are massive enough to maintain atmospheres, [E] planets are small enough in mass to remain non-degenerate, [F] planets are massive enough to support sufficiently complex biospheres, [G] planets are smaller in mass than their host stars, and [H] stars are smaller in mass than their host galaxies. This paper delineates the portion of the \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-\${\textbackslash}alpha\_G\$ plane that satisfies all of these constraints. The results indicate that viable universes --- with working stars and habitable planets --- can exist within a parameter space where the structure constants \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and \${\textbackslash}alpha\_G\$ vary by several orders of magnitude. These constraints also provide upper bounds on the structure constants (\${\textbackslash}alpha,{\textbackslash}alpha\_G\$) and their ratio. We find the limit \${\textbackslash}alpha\_G/{\textbackslash}alpha{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}\{-34\}\$, which shows that habitable universes must have a large hierarchy between the strengths of the gravitational force and the electromagnetic force.},

	abstract = {This paper presents applications of a weighted meshless scheme for conservation laws to the Euler equations and the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics ({MHD}). The divergence constraint of the latter is maintained to the truncation error by a new meshless divergence cleaning procedure. The physics of the interaction between the particles is described by a one-dimensional Riemann problem in a moving frame. As a result, the necessary diffusion which is required to treat dissipative processes is added automatically. Our scheme therefore has no free parameters that control the physics of interparticle interaction, with the exception of the number of interacting neighbours which control the resolution and accuracy. The resulting equations have a form similar to smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) equations, and therefore existing {SPH} codes can be used to implement the weighed particle scheme. The scheme is validated in several hydrodynamic and {MHD} test cases. In particular, we demonstrate for the first time the ability of a meshless {MHD} scheme to model magnetorotational instability in accretion discs.},

	abstract = {Methods to solve the relativistic hydrodynamic equations are a key computational kernel in a large number of astrophysics simulations and are crucial to understanding the electromagnetic signals that originate from the merger of astrophysical compact objects. Because of the many physical length scales present when simulating such mergers, these methods must be highly adaptive and capable of automatically resolving numerous localized features and instabilities that emerge throughout the computational domain across many temporal scales. While this has been historically accomplished with adaptive mesh refinement ({AMR}) based methods, alternatives based on wavelet bases and the wavelet transformation have recently achieved significant success in adaptive representation for advanced engineering applications. This work presents a new method for the integration of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations using iterated interpolating wavelets and introduces a highly adaptive implementation for multidimensional simulation. The wavelet coefficients provide a direct measure of the local approximation error for the solution and place collocation points that naturally adapt to the fluid flow while providing good conservation of fluid quantities. The resulting implementation, {OAHU}, is applied to a series of demanding one- and two-dimensional problems which explore high Lorentz factor outflows and the formation of several instabilities, including the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.},

	abstract = {We explore the impact of cosmic rays ({CRs}) on cosmological adaptive-mesh refinement simulations of a forming 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msolar halo, focusing on the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}), and its resulting low-redshift structure and composition. In contrast to a run with star formation and energetic feedback but no {CRs}, the {CR}-inclusive runs feature a {CGM} substantially enriched with {CRs} and with metals to roughly 0.1 Zsolar, thanks to robust, persistent outflows from the disk. The {CR}-inclusive {CGMs} also feature more diffuse gas at lower temperatures, down to 10{\textasciicircum}4 K, than the non-{CR} run, with diffuse material often receiving a majority of its pressure support from the {CR} proton fluid. We compare to recent observations of the {CGM} of L {\textasciitilde} L* galaxies at low redshift, including {UV} absorption lines within background quasar spectra. The combination of metal-enriched, {CR}-driven winds and large swaths of {CR} pressure-supported, cooler diffuse gas leads to a {CGM} that provides a better match to data from {COS}-Halos (for {HI}, {SiIV}, {CIII} and {OVI}) than the non-{CR} run. We also compare our models to recent, preliminary observations of diffuse gamma-ray emission in local group halos. For our lower {CR}-diffusion runs with kappa\_CR in the range 0.3 to 1 x 10{\textasciicircum}28 cm{\textasciicircum}2/s, the {CR} enriched {CGM} produces an inconsistently high level of gamma emission. But the model with a relatively high kappa\_CR = 3 x 10{\textasciicircum}28 cm{\textasciicircum}2/s provided a gamma-ray luminosity consistent with the extra-galactic gamma-ray background observed by {FERMI} and roughly consistent with preliminary measures of the emission from M31's {CGM}.},

	abstract = {Stellar winds and supernova ({SN}) explosions of massive stars ("stellar feedback") create bubbles in the interstellar medium ({ISM}) and insert newly produced heavy elements and kinetic energy into their surroundings, possibly driving turbulence. Most of this energy is thermalized and immediately removed from the {ISM} by radiative cooling. The rest is available for driving {ISM} dynamics. In this work we estimate the amount of feedback energy retained as kinetic energy when the bubble walls have decelerated to the sound speed of the ambient medium. We show that the feedback of the most massive star outweighs the feedback from less massive stars. For a giant molecular cloud ({GMC}) mass of 1e5 solar masses (as e.g. found in the Orion {GMCs}) and a star formation efficiency of 8\% the initial mass function predicts a most massive star of approximately 60 solar masses. For this stellar evolution model we test the dependence of the retained kinetic energy of the cold {GMC} gas on the inclusion of stellar winds. In our model winds insert 2.34 times the energy of a {SN} and create stellar wind bubbles serving as pressure reservoirs. We find that during the pressure driven phases of the bubble evolution radiative losses peak near the contact discontinuity ({CD}), and thus, the retained energy depends critically on the scales of the mixing processes across the {CD}. Taking into account the winds of massive stars increases the amount of kinetic energy deposited in the cold {ISM} from 0.1\% to a few percent of the feedback energy.},

Results from numerical simulations of star formation qualitatively resemble an observed mass function, a scale free power law with a sharp decline at low masses. However, most analytic {IMF} theories critically depend on the empirically chosen input spectrum of mass fluctuations which evolve into dense cores and, subsequently, stars. Here we propose a new approach exploiting the techniques from the field of network science. We represent a system of dense cores accreting gas from the surrounding diffuse interstellar medium ({ISM}) as a spatial network growing by preferential attachment and assume that the {ISM} density has a self-similar fractal distribution following the Kolmogorov turbulence theory. As opposed to gravoturbulent fragmentation theories, we consider the dense core growth and demonstrate that the power law core mass function emerges independently of the initial distribution of density fluctuations by mass. Our model yields a power law solely defined by the fractal dimensionalities of the {ISM} and accreting gas. With a proper choice of the low mass cut-off, it reproduces observations over three decades in mass. We also rule out a low mass star dominated ``bottom-heavy'' {IMF} in a single star forming region.},

We apply {SFR} indicators with different sensitivity timescales to galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments ({FIRE}) simulations. We find that the {SFR}--\$M\_*\$ relation has a significantly greater scatter when the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$-derived {SFR} is considered compared with when the far-ultraviolet ({FUV})-based {SFR} is used. This difference is a direct consequence of bursty star formation because the {FIRE} galaxies exhibit order-of-magnitude {SFR} variations over timescales of a few Myr. We show that the difference in the scatter between the simulated H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$- and {FUV}-derived {SFR}--\$M\_*\$ relations at \$z=2\$ is consistent with observational constraints.

We systematically study how advection, anisotropic diffusion and additional Alfv{\textbackslash}'en-wave cooling affect the galactic disk and the circum-galactic medium ({CGM}). Global properties such as stellar mass and star formation rate vary little between simulations with and without various {CR} transport physics, whereas structural properties such as disk sizes, {CGM} densities or temperatures can be strongly affected. In our simulations, {CRs} affect the accretion of gas onto galaxies by modifying the {CGM} flow structure. This alters the angular momentum distribution which manifests itself as a difference in stellar and gaseous disk size. The strength of this effect depends on the {CR} transport model: {CR} advection results in the most compact disks while the Alfv{\textbackslash}'en-wave model resembles more the {AURIGA} model. The advection and diffusion models exhibit large (\$r{\textbackslash}sim50\$ kpc) {CR} pressure-dominated gas haloes causing a smoother and partly cooler {CGM}. The additional {CR} pressure smoothes small-scale density peaks and compensates for the missing thermal pressure support at lower {CGM} temperatures. In contrast, the Alfv{\textbackslash}'en-wave model is only {CR} pressure dominated at the disk-halo interface and only in this model the gamma-ray emission from hadronic interactions agrees with observations. In contrast to previous findings, we conclude that details of {CR} transport are critical for accurately predicting the impact of {CR} feedback on galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {Recent observations show that the cooling flows in the central regions of galaxy clusters are highly suppressed. Observed active galactic nuclei ({AGN})-induced cavities/bubbles are a leading candidate for suppressing cooling, usually via some form of mechanical heating. At the same time, observed X-ray cavities and synchrotron emission point towards a significant non-thermal particle population. Previous studies have focused on the dynamical effects of cosmic ray pressure support, but none has built successful models in which cosmic ray heating is significant. Here, we investigate a new model of {AGN} heating, in which the intracluster medium is efficiently heated by cosmic rays, which are injected into the intra-cluster medium ({ICM}) through diffusion or the shredding of the bubbles by Rayleigh-Taylor or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. We include thermal conduction as well. Using numerical simulations, we show that the cooling catastrophe is efficiently suppressed. The cluster quickly relaxes to a quasi-equilibrium state with a highly reduced accretion rate and temperature and density profiles which match observations. Unlike the conduction-only case, no fine-tuning of the Spitzer conduction suppression factor f is needed. The cosmic ray pressure, Pc/Pg {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.1 and ∇Pc {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.1rhog, is well within observational bounds. Cosmic ray heating is a very attractive alternative to mechanical heating, and may become particularly compelling if Gamma-ray Large Array Space Telescope ({GLAST}) detects the gamma-ray signature of cosmic rays in clusters.},

	abstract = {Central jetted active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) appear to heat the core regions of the intracluster medium ({ICM}) in cooling-core galaxy clusters and groups, thereby preventing a cooling catastrophe. However, the physical mechanism(s) by which the directed flow of kinetic energy is thermalized throughout the {ICM} core remains unclear. We examine one widely discussed mechanism whereby the {AGN} induces subsonic turbulence in the ambient medium, the dissipation of which provides the {ICM} heat source. Through controlled inviscid 3-d hydrodynamic simulations, we verify that explosive {AGN}-like events can launch gravity waves (g-modes) into the ambient {ICM} which in turn decay to volume-filling turbulence. In our model, however, this process is found to be inefficient, with less than 1\% of the energy injected by the {AGN} activity actually ending up in the turbulence of the ambient {ICM}. This efficiency is an order of magnitude or more too small to explain the observations of {AGN}-feedback in galaxy clusters and groups with short central cooling times. Atmospheres in which the g-modes are strongly trapped/confined have an even lower efficiency since, in these models, excitation of turbulence relies on the g-modes' ability to escape from the center of the cluster into the bulk {ICM}. Our results suggest that, if {AGN}-induced turbulence is indeed the mechanism by which the {AGN} heats the {ICM} core, its driving may rely on physics beyond that captured in our ideal hydrodynamic model.},

In the cores of many clusters, radiative energy losses from the {ICM} occur on timescales much shorter than the age of the system. Unchecked, this cooling would lead to massive accumulations of cold gas and vigorous star formation, in contradiction to observations. Various sources of energy capable of compensating for these cooling losses have been proposed, the most promising being heating by the supermassive black holes in the central galaxies, through inflation of bubbles of relativistic plasma. Regardless of the original source of energy, the question of how this energy is transferred to the {ICM} remains open. Here we present a plausible solution to this question based on deep X-ray data and a new data analysis method that enable us to evaluate directly the {ICM} heating rate from the dissipation of turbulence. We find that turbulent heating is sufficient to offset radiative cooling and indeed appears to balance it locally at each radius-it may therefore be the key element in resolving the gas cooling problem in cluster cores and, more universally, in the atmospheres of X-ray-emitting, gas-rich systems on scales from galaxy clusters to groups and elliptical galaxies.},

	abstract = {We compare the mass and internal distribution of atomic hydrogen ({HI}) in 2200 present-day central galaxies with M\_star {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}10 M\_Sun from the 100 Mpc {EAGLE} Reference simulation to observational data. Atomic hydrogen fractions are corrected for self-shielding using a fitting formula from radiative transfer simulations and for the presence of molecular hydrogen using an empirical or a theoretical prescription from the literature. The resulting neutral hydrogen fractions, M\_({HI}+H2)/M\_star, agree with observations to better than 0.1 dex for galaxies with M\_star between 10{\textasciicircum}10 and 10{\textasciicircum}11 M\_Sun. Our fiducial, empirical H2 model based on gas pressure results in galactic {HI} mass fractions, M\_HI/M\_star, that agree with observations from the {GASS} survey to better than 0.3 dex, but the alternative theoretical H2 formula leads to a negative offset in M\_HI/M\_star of up to 0.5 dex. Visual inspection reveals that most {HI} disks in simulated {HI}-rich galaxies are vertically disturbed, plausibly due to recent accretion events. Many galaxies (up to 80 per cent) contain spuriously large {HI} holes, which are likely formed as a consequence of the feedback implementation in {EAGLE}. The {HI} mass-size relation of all simulated galaxies is close to (but 16 per cent steeper than) observed, and when only galaxies without large holes in the {HI} disc are considered, the agreement becomes excellent (better than 0.1 dex). The presence of large {HI} holes also makes the radial {HI} surface density profiles somewhat too low in the centre, at {\textbackslash}Sigma\_HI {\textgreater} 1 M\_Sun pc{\textasciicircum}-2 (by a factor of {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 2 compared to data from the Bluedisk survey). In the outer region ({\textbackslash}Sigma\_HI {\textless} 1 M\_Sun pc{\textasciicircum}-2), the simulated profiles agree quantitatively with observations. Scaled by {HI} size, the simulated profiles of {HI}-rich (M\_HI {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}9.8 M\_Sun) and control galaxies (10{\textasciicircum}9.1 M\_Sun {\textgreater} M\_HI {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}9.8 M\_Sun) follow each other closely, as observed.

	abstract = {In this thesis, we systematically analyze the properties of intergalactic {\textbackslash}Ovi absorbing gas structures at high redshift using optical spectra with intermediate (\${\textbackslash}sim 6.6\$ {\textbackslash}kms {FWHM}) and high (\${\textbackslash}sim 4.0\$ {\textbackslash}kms {FWHM}) resolution, obtained with {UVES}/{VLT}. We complement our analysis with synthetic spectra obtained from extensive cosmological simulations that are part of the {OWLS} project (Schaye et al. 2010). Our main conclusions are: 1) Both the observations and simulations imply that {\textbackslash}Ovi absorbers at high redshift arise in structures spanning a broad range of scales and different physical conditions. When the {\textbackslash}Ovi components are characterized by small Doppler parameters, the ionizing mechanism is most likely photoionization; otherwise, collisional ionization is the dominant mechanism. 2) The baryon- and metal-content of the {\textbackslash}Ovi absorbers at \$z{\textbackslash}approx2\$ is less than one per cent of the total mass-density of baryons and metals at that redshift. Therefore, {\textbackslash}Ovi absorbers do not trace the bulk of baryons and metals at that epoch. 3) The {\textbackslash}Ovi gas density, metallicity and non-thermal broadening mechanisms are significantly different at high redshift with respect to low redshift. In particular, non-thermal broadening mechanisms appear less important at high redshift as compared to low redshift, where the turbulence in the absorption gas might be significant. This, together with the result that {\textbackslash}Ovi arises in different environments, embedded in small- and large-scale structures, indicates that {\textbackslash}Ovi does not trace characteristic regions in the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium, but rather traces a gas phase with a characteristic transition temperature (\$T{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{5\}\$K). 4) The {\textbackslash}Ovi absorbers at high redshift arise in gas with metallicities significantly higher than the surrounding environment, which suggests an inhomogeneous metal enrichment of the {IGM}.},

We show that the question can be answered in terms of the properties of various graph-theoretical matrices, affording an efficient way to estimate and place bounds on the strong-coupling scale of a given theory. In light of this we also consider the problem of relating a given theory graph to a discretised higher dimensional theory, a la dimensional deconstruction.},

I review how {AGN} feedback is tightly coupled with the formation of multiphase gas and the newly probed chaotic cold accretion ({CCA}). In a turbulent and heated atmosphere, cold clouds and kpc-scale filaments condense out of the plasma via thermal instability and rain toward the black hole. In the nucleus, the recurrent chaotic collisions between the cold clouds, filaments, and central torus promote angular momentum cancellation or mixing, boosting the accretion rate up to 100 times the Bondi rate. The rapid variability triggers powerful {AGN} outflows, which quench the cooling flow and star formation without destroying the cool core. The {AGN} heating stifles the formation of multiphase gas and accretion, the feedback subsides and the hot halo is allowed to cool again, restarting a new cycle. Ultimately, {CCA} creates a symbiotic link between the black hole and the whole host via a tight self-regulated feedback which preserves the gaseous halo in global thermal equilibrium throughout cosmic time.},

	abstract = {We present the first model that couples high-resolution simulations of the formation of Local Group galaxies with calculations of the galactic habitable zone ({GHZ}), a region of space which has sufficient metallicity to form terrestrial planets without being subject to hazardous radiation. These simulations allow us to make substantial progress in mapping out the asymmetric three-dimensional {GHZ} and its time evolution for the Milky Way ({MW}) and Triangulum (M33) galaxies, as opposed to works that generally assume an azimuthally symmetric {GHZ}. Applying typical habitability metrics to {MW} and M33, we find that while a large number of habitable planets exist as close as a few kiloparsecs from the galactic centre, the probability of individual planetary systems being habitable rises as one approaches the edge of the stellar disc. Tidal streams and satellite galaxies also appear to be fertile grounds for habitable planet formation. In short, we find that both galaxies arrive at similar {GHZs} by different evolutionary paths, as measured by the first and third quartiles of surviving biospheres. For the Milky Way, this interquartile range begins as a narrow band at large radii, expanding to encompass much of the galaxy at intermediate times before settling at a range of 2-13kpc. In the case of M33, the opposite behaviour occurs - the initial and final interquartile ranges are quite similar, showing gradual evolution. This suggests that galaxy assembly history strongly influences the time evolution of the {GHZ}, which will affect the relative time lag between biospheres in different galactic locations. We end by noting the caveats involved in such studies and demonstrate that high resolution cosmological simulations will play a vital role in understanding habitability on galactic scales, provided that these simulations accurately resolve chemical evolution.},

	abstract = {We investigate the origin of extragalactic continuum emission and its relation to the stellar population of a recently discovered peculiar z=3.344 Lyman alpha emitter. Based on an analysis of the broad-band colors and morphology we find further support for the idea that the underlying galaxy is being fed by a large-scale (L {\textgreater} 35 kpc) accretion stream. Archival {HST} images show small scale ({\textasciitilde}5 kpc) tentacular filaments converging near a hot-spot of star-formation, possibly fueled by gas falling in along the filaments. The spectral energy distribution of the tentacles is broadly compatible with either (1) non-ionizing rest-frame far-{UV} continuum emission from stars formed in an 60 million-year-old starburst; (2) nebular 2-photon-continuum radiation, arising from collisional excitation cooling, or (3) a recombination spectrum emitted by hydrogen fluorescing in response to ionizing radiation escaping from the galaxy. The latter possibility simultaneously accounts for the presence of asymmetric Lyman alpha emission from the large-scale gaseous filament and the nebular continuum in the smaller-scale tentacles as caused by the escape of ionizing radiation from the galaxy. Possible astrophysical explanations for the nature of the tentacles include: a galactic wind powered by the starburst; in-falling gas during cold accretion, or tails of interstellar medium dragged out of the galaxy by satellite halos that have plunged through the main halo. The possibility of detecting extragalactic 2-photon continuum emission in space-based, broad-band images suggests a tool for studying the gaseous environment of high redshift galaxies at much greater spatial detail than possible with Lyman alpha or other resonance line emission.},

We show that the typical physical densities of the absorbing gas increase with column density and redshift, but decrease with the ionization energy of the absorbing ion. The typical metallicity increases with both column density and time. The fraction of collisionally ionized metal absorbers increases with time and ionization energy. While our results show little sensitivity to the presence or absence of {AGN} feedback, increasing/decreasing the efficiency of stellar feedback by a factor of two substantially decreases/increases the {CDDFs} and the cosmic densities of the metal ions. We show that the impact of the efficiency of stellar feedback on the {CDDFs} and cosmic densities is largely due to its effect on the metal production rate. However, the temperatures of the metal absorbers, particularly those of strong {OVI}, are directly sensitive to the strength of the feedback.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a new theory for unification of electromagnetic and gravitational interactions. By considering a four-dimensional spacetime as a hypersurface embedded in a five-dimensional bulk spacetime, we derive the complete set of field equations on the four-dimensional spacetime from the five-dimensional Einstein field equation. We show that, besides the Einstein field equation on the four-dimensional spacetime, a new electromagnetic field equation is also derived: \${\textbackslash}nabla\_a F{\textasciicircum}\{ab\}-{\textbackslash}xi R{\textasciicircum}b\_\{{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash},a\}A{\textasciicircum}a=-4{\textbackslash}pi J{\textasciicircum}b\$ with \${\textbackslash}xi=-2\$, where \$F{\textasciicircum}\{ab\}\$ is the antisymmetric electromagnetic field tensor defined by the potential vector \$A{\textasciicircum}a\$, \$R\_\{ab\}\$ is the Ricci curvature tensor of the hypersurface, and \$J{\textasciicircum}a\$ is the electric current vector. The new electromagnetic field equation differs from the Einstein-Maxwell equation by a curvature-coupled term \${\textbackslash}xi R{\textasciicircum}b\_\{{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash},a\}A{\textasciicircum}a\$, which addresses the problem of incompatibility of the Einstein-Maxwell equation with a universe containing a uniformly distributed net charge as discussed in a previous paper by the author. Hence, the new theory is different from the Kaluza-Klein theory and its variants. In the four-dimensional Einstein field equation derived in the new theory, the source term includes the stress-energy tensor of electromagnetic fields as well as the stress-energy tensor of other unidentified matter. We show that, under some conditions the unidentified matter can be interpreted as a cosmological constant on the four-dimensional spacetime. We argue that, the new electromagnetic field equation and hence the new unified theory can be tested in an environment with a high mass density, e.g., inside a neutron star or a white dwarf, and in the early epoch of the universe.},

Among star-forming galaxies, the mass, temperature, and metallicity of the {CGM} increase with stellar mass, driving an increase in the {OVI} column density profile of \${\textbackslash}sim 0.5\$ dex with each \$0.5\$ dex increase in stellar mass. Observed {OVI} column density profiles exhibit a weaker mass dependence than predicted: the simulated {OVI} abundance profiles are consistent with those observed for star-forming galaxies of mass \$M\_{\textbackslash}bigstar = 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5-11.5\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, but underpredict the observed {OVI} abundances by \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.8\$ dex for lower-mass galaxies. We suggest that this discrepancy may be alleviated with additional heating of the abundant cool gas in low-mass halos, or with increased numerical resolution capturing turbulent/conductive mixing layers between {CGM} phases. Quenched galaxies of mass \$M\_{\textbackslash}bigstar = 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5-11.5\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ are found to have 0.3-0.8 dex lower {OVI} column density profiles than star-forming galaxies of the same mass, in qualitative agreement with the observed {OVI} abundance bimodality. This offset is driven by {AGN} feedback, which quenches galaxies by heating the {CGM} and ejecting significant amounts of gas from the halo. Finally, we find that the inclusion of the central galaxy's radiation field may enhance the photoionization of the {CGM} within \${\textbackslash}sim 50\$ kpc, further increasing the predicted {OVI} abundance around star-forming galaxies.},

We find higher {EWs} along the projected minor axis with weaker {EWs} along the project major axis. Highly inclined galaxies have the lowest covering fractions due to minimized outflow/inflow cross-section geometry. Absorbing galaxies also have bluer colors while non-absorbers have redder colors, suggesting that star-formation is a key driver in the {OVI} detection rate. {OVI} surrounding blue galaxies exists primarily along the projected minor axis with wide opening angles while {OVI} surrounding red galaxies exists primarily along the projected major axis with smaller opening angles, which may explain why absorption around red galaxies is less frequently detected. Our results are consistent with {CGM} originating from major axis-fed inflows/recycled gas and from minor axis-driven outflows. Non-detected {OVI} occurs between \${\textbackslash}Phi=20-60{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$, suggesting that {OVI} is not mixed throughout the {CGM} and remains confined within the outflows and the disk-plane.

Throughout, we highlight successes and failings of current galaxy formation theory. We include a review of computational implementations of galaxy formation theory and assess their ability to provide reliable modelling of this complex phenomenon. We finish with a discussion of several "hot topics" in contemporary galaxy formation theory and assess future directions for this field.},

	abstract = {Low-mass dwarf galaxies are very sensitive test-beds for theories of cosmic structure formation since their weak gravitational fields allow the effects of the relevant physical processes to clearly stand out. Up to now, no unified account exists of the sometimes seemingly conflicting properties of the faintest isolated dwarfs in and around the Local Group, such as Leo T and the recently discovered Leo P and Pisces A systems. Using new numerical simulations, we show that this serious challenge to our understanding of galaxy formation can be effectively resolved by taking into account the regulating influence of the ultraviolet radiation of the first population of stars on a dwarf's star formation rate while otherwise staying within the standard cosmological paradigm for structure formation. These simulations produce faint, gas-dominated, star-forming dwarf galaxies that lie on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and that successfully reproduce a broad range of chemical, kinematical, and structural observables of real late-type dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, we stress the importance of obtaining properties of simulated galaxies in a manner as close as possible to the typically employed observational techniques.},

	abstract = {Observations of clusters and groups imply that such halos are roughly in global thermal equilibrium, with heating balancing cooling when averaged over sufficiently long time- and length-scales; the {ICM} is, however, very likely to be locally thermally unstable. Using simple observationally-motivated heating prescriptions, we show that local thermal instability ({TI}) can produce a multi-phase medium---with {\textasciitilde} 10000 K cold filaments condensing out of the hot {ICM}---only when the ratio of the {TI} timescale in the hot plasma (t\_\{{TI}\}) to the free-fall timescale (t\_\{ff\}) satisfies t\_\{{TI}\}/t\_\{ff\} {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 10. This criterion quantitatively explains why cold gas and star formation are preferentially observed in low-entropy clusters and groups. In addition, the interplay among heating, cooling, and {TI} reduces the net cooling rate and the mass accretion rate at small radii by factors of {\textasciitilde} 100 relative to cooling-flow models. This dramatic reduction is in line with observations. The feedback efficiency required to prevent a cooling-flow is {\textasciitilde} 0.001 for clusters and decreases for lower mass halos; supernova heating may be energetically sufficient to balance cooling in galactic halos. We further argue that the {ICM} self-adjusts so that t\_\{{TI}\}/t\_\{ff\} {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 10 at all radii. When this criterion is not satisfied, cold filaments condense out of the hot phase and reduce the density of the {ICM}. These cold filaments can power the black hole and/or stellar feedback required for global thermal balance, which drives t\_\{{TI}\}/t\_\{ff\} {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 10. In comparison to clusters, groups have central cores with lower densities and larger radii. This can account for the deviations from self-similarity in the X-ray luminosity-temperature (L\_X-T\_X) relation. The high-velocity clouds observed in the Galactic halo can also be due to local {TI} producing multi-phase gas close to the virial radius.},

	abstract = {Most of the massive elliptical galaxies in the universe stopped forming stars billions of years ago, even though plenty of hot gas remains available for star formation. Here we present compelling evidence indicating that quenching of star formation depends on both black hole feedback and Type Ia supernova ({SN}) heating. We analyze Chandra X-ray observations of 10 massive ellipticals, 5 with extended, potentially star-forming multiphase gas and 5 single-phase ellipticals with no star formation. The ratio of cooling time to freefall time at 1–10 kpc in the multiphase galaxies is \{\{t\}cool\}/\{\{t\}ff\}≈ 10, indicating that precipitation-driven feedback limits cooling but does not eliminate condensation. In the same region of the single-phase galaxies, the radial profiles of gas entropy are consistent with a thermally stable (\{\{t\}cool\}/\{\{t\}ff\}{\textbackslash}gt 20) {SN}-driven outflow that sweeps stellar ejecta out of the galaxy. However, in one of those single-phase ellipticals ({NGC} 4261) we find \{\{t\}cool\}/\{\{t\}ff\}≲ 10 at {\textbackslash}lt 300 pc. Notably, its jets are ∼50 times more powerful than in the other nine ellipticals, in agreement with models indicating that precipitation near the black hole should switch its fueling mode from Bondi-like accretion to cold chaotic accretion. We conclude by hypothesizing that particularly strong black hole outbursts can shut off star formation in massive elliptical galaxies by boosting the entropy of the hot gas and flipping the system into the {SN}-sweeping state.},

In addition, we find that most of Lyman limit systems in our simulations are located within the virial radii of galaxies with a wide range of masses, and are physically associated with them (``bits and pieces'' of galaxy formation). While the finite resolution of our simulations cannot exclude an existence of a second population of self-shielded, neutral gas clouds located in low mass dark matter halos (``minihalos''), our simulations are not consistent with ``minihalos'' dominating the total abundance of Lyman limit systems.},

It is argued that this finding is in conflict with the standard interpretation of absorption systems, which invokes separate and unrelated intergalactic (Ly-alpha) and galactic halo (metal-line) absorption systems. A more natural explanation is that both the Ly-alpha and metal-line systems belong to the same population. They would have the same origins and the same spatial locations. The simplest possibility, that they all have the same high metal abundances, is considered to be unlikely, even though it does offer straightforward explanations for four different observational enigmas. However, it is entirely possible that the majority of Ly-alpha systems (those with low H I column densities) contain metals. Possible physical origins for the power-law form of f(N) are also discussed.},

These quasars have strong intervening Mg {II}-Fe {II} systems that are known signatures of high column density neutral gas. In total, including our previous surveys, {UV} observations of Lyα absorption in 197 Mg {II} systems with z{\textless}1.65 and rest equivalent width ({REW}) Wλ27960{\textgreater}=0.3 Å have now been obtained. The main results are as follows: (1) The success rate of identifying {DLAs} in a Mg {II} sample with Wλ27960{\textgreater}=0.5 Å and Fe {II} Wλ26000{\textgreater}=0.5 Å is 36\%+/-6\% and increases to 42\%+/-7\% for systems with Wλ27960/Wλ26000{\textless}2 and Mg I Wλ28520{\textgreater}0.1 Å. (2) The mean H I column density of Mg {II} systems with 0.3 Å{\textless}=Wλ27960{\textless}0.6 Å is =(9.7+/-2.2)×1018 cm-2. For the larger {REW} systems in our sample, =(3.5+/-0.7)×1020 cm-2. (3) The {DLA} incidence per unit redshift for 0{\textless}z{\textless}5 is {nDLA}(z)=n0(1+z)γ, where n0=0.044+/-0.005 and γ=1.27+/-0.11. This parameterization is consistent with no evolution for z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}2 (ΩΛ=0.7, ΩM=0.3) but exhibits significant evolution for z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}2. (4) The cosmological neutral gas mass density due to {DLAs} is constant in the redshift interval 0.5{\textless}z{\textless}5.0 to within the uncertainties, Ω{DLA}{\textasciitilde}1×10-3. This is larger than Ωgas(z=0) by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2. (5) The slope of the H I column density distribution does not change significantly with redshift. However, the low-redshift distribution is marginally flatter due to the higher fraction of high column density systems in our sample. (6) Finally, using the precision of Mg {II} survey statistics, we show that under the assumption of constant {DLA} fraction and H I column density suggested by our current sample, there may be evidence of a decreasing Ω{DLA} from z=0.5 to 0.

	abstract = {We show that the Lyman-alpha optical depth statistics in the proximity regions of quasar spectra depend on the mass of the dark matter halos hosting the quasars. This is owing to both the overdensity around the quasars and the associated infall of gas toward them. For a fiducial quasar host halo mass of (3.0+/-1.6) h{\textasciicircum}-1 x 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun, as inferred by Croom et al. from clustering in the 2dF {QSO} Redshift Survey, we show that estimates of the ionizing background (Gamma{\textasciicircum}bkg) from proximity effect measurements could be biased high by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2.5 at z=3 owing to neglecting these effects alone. The clustering of galaxies and other active galactic nuclei around the proximity effect quasars enhances the local background, but is not expected to skew measurements by more than a few percent. Assuming the measurements of Gamma{\textasciicircum}bkg based on the mean flux decrement in the Ly-alpha forest to be free of bias, we demonstrate how the proximity effect analysis can be inverted to measure the mass of the dark matter halos hosting quasars. In ideal conditions, such a measurement could be made with a precision comparable to the best clustering constraints to date from a modest sample of only about 100 spectra. We discuss observational difficulties, including continuum flux estimation, quasar systematic redshift determination, and quasar variability, which make accurate proximity effect measurements challenging in practice. These are also likely to contribute to the discrepancies between existing proximity effect and flux decrement measurements of Gamma{\textasciicircum}bkg.},

The reference run adopts a blastwave scheme for supernova feedback that produces large-scale galactic outflows, a star formation recipe based on a high gas density threshold, metal-dependent radiative cooling, and a model for the diffusion of metals and thermal energy. The effect of the local {UV} radiation field is added in post-processing. The {CGM} (defined as all gas at R \&gt; 0.2 R vir = 10 kpc, where R vir is the virial radius) contains multiple phases having a wide range of physical conditions, with more than half of its heavy elements locked in a warm-hot component at T \&gt; 105 K. Synthetic spectra, generated by drawing sightlines through the {CGM}, produce interstellar absorption-line strengths of Lyα, C {II}, C {IV}, Si {II}, and Si {IV} as a function of the galactocentric impact parameter (scaled to the virial radius) that are in broad agreement with those observed at high redshift by Steidel et al. The covering factor of absorbing material declines less rapidly with impact parameter for Lyα and C {IV} compared to C {II}, Si {IV}, and Si {II}, with Lyα remaining strong (W Lyα \&gt; 300 {mÅ}) to \&gt;{\textasciitilde} 5 R vir = 250 kpc. Only about one third of all the gas within R vir is outflowing. The fraction of sightlines within one virial radius that intercept optically thick, N H I\&gt;1017.2 cm-2 material is 27\%, in agreement with recent observations by Rudie et al. Such optically thick absorption is shown to trace inflowing "cold" streams that penetrate deep inside the virial radius. The streams, enriched to metallicities above 0.01 solar by previous episodes of star formation in the main host and in nearby dwarfs, are the origin of strong (N C {II}\&gt;1013 cm-2) C {II} absorption with a covering factor of 22\% within R vir and 10\% within 2 R vir. Galactic outflows do not cause any substantial suppression of the cold accretion mode. The central galaxy is surrounded by a large O {VI} halo, with a typical column density N O {VI} \&gt;{\textasciitilde} 1014 cm-2 and a near unity covering factor maintained all the way out to 150 kpc. This matches the trends recently observed in star-forming galaxies at low redshift by Tumlinson et al. Our zoom-in simulations of this single system appear then to reproduce quantitatively the complex baryonic processes that determine the exchange of matter, energy, and metals between galaxies and their surroundings.},

We obtain a parameterized stellar-to-halo mass ({SHM}) relation by populating halos and subhalos in an N-body simulation with galaxies and requiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced. We find good agreement with constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and predictions of semi-analytic models. Using this mapping, and the positions of the halos and subhalos obtained from the simulation, we find that our model predictions for the galaxy two-point correlation function ({CF}) as a function of stellar mass are in excellent agreement with the observed clustering properties in the {SDSS} at z=0. We show that the clustering data do not provide additional strong constraints on the {SHM} function and conclude that our model can therefore predict clustering as a function of stellar mass. We compute the conditional mass function, which yields the average number of galaxies with stellar masses in the range [m, m+dm] that reside in a halo of mass M. We study the redshift dependence of the {SHM} relation and show that, for low mass halos, the {SHM} ratio is lower at higher redshift. The derived {SHM} relation is used to predict the stellar mass dependent galaxy {CF} and bias at high redshift. Our model predicts that not only are massive galaxies more biased than low mass ones at all redshifts, but the bias increases more rapidly with increasing redshift for massive galaxies than for low mass ones. We present convenient fitting functions for the {SHM} relation as a function of redshift, the conditional mass function, and the bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift.},

It is therefore a fundamental ingredient to theoretical and empirical studies of both the {IGM} and galaxy formation. We present here a new calculation of its spectrum that satisfies the empirical constraints we recently obtained by combining state-of-the-art luminosity functions and intergalactic opacity measurements. In our preferred model, star-forming galaxies and quasars each contribute substantially to the {HI} ionizing field at z{\textless}3, with galaxies rapidly overtaking quasars at higher redshifts as quasars become rarer. In addition to our fiducial model, we explore the physical dependences of the calculated background and clarify how recombination emission contributes to the ionization rates. We find that recombinations do not simply boost the ionization rates by the number of reemitted ionizing photons as many of these rapidly redshift below the ionization edges and have a distribution of energies. A simple analytic model that captures the main effects seen in our numerical radiative transfer calculations is given. Finally, we discuss the effects of {HeII} reionization by quasars on both the spectrum of the ionizing background and on the thermal history of the {IGM}. In regions that have yet to be reionized, the spectrum is expected to be almost completely suppressed immediately above 54.4 {eV} while a background of higher-energy ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.5 {keV}) photons permeates the entire universe owing to the frequency-dependence of the photoionization cross section. We provide an analytic model of the heat input during {HeII} reionization and its effects on the temperature-density relation.},

	abstract = {We use a set of cosmological simulations combined with radiative transfer calculations to investigate the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the post-reionization Universe. We assess the contributions from the metagalactic ionizing background, collisional ionization and diffuse recombination radiation to the total ionization rate at redshifts z=0-5. We find that the densities above which hydrogen self-shielding becomes important are consistent with analytic calculations and previous work. However, because of diffuse recombination radiation, whose intensity peaks at the same density, the transition between highly ionized and self-shielded regions is smoother than what is usually assumed. We provide fitting functions to the simulated photoionization rate as a function of density and show that post-processing simulations with the fitted rates yields results that are in excellent agreement with the original radiative transfer calculations. The predicted neutral hydrogen column density distributions agree very well with the observations. In particular, the simulations reproduce the remarkable lack of evolution in the column density distribution of Lyman limit and weak damped Ly{\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash} systems below z = 3. The evolution of the low column density end is affected by the increasing importance of collisional ionization with decreasing redshift. On the other hand, the simulations predict the abundance of strong damped Ly{\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash} systems to broadly track the cosmic star formation rate density.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}{nPublished} in: Mon.Not.Roy.Astron.Soc.430:2427,2013},

Our results show that the shape of f(N\_HI) is determined primarily by the {UVB} with a much weaker effect by the local stellar radiation and that the optically thin approximation often used in cosmological simulation is inadequate to properly treat the ionization structure of neutral gas in and out of {DLAs}.

It is shown that many aspects of the current physical picture of the forest, in particular the fact that the absorption arises in extended structures of moderate overdensities that contain a large fraction of the baryons in the universe, can be derived directly from the observations without making any specific assumptions about the presence and distribution of dark matter, the values of the cosmological parameters, or the mechanism for structure formation. The key argument is that along any line of sight intersecting a gravitationally confined gas cloud, the size of the region over which the density is of order the maximum density, is typically of order the local Jeans length. This is true for overdense absorbers, regardless of the shape of the cloud and regardless of whether the cloud as a whole is in dynamical equilibrium. The simple analytic model is used to derive the mass distribution of the photoionized gas directly from the observed column density distribution. It is demonstrated that the shape of the column density distribution, in particular the observed deviations from a single power law, and its evolution with redshift, reflect the shape of the matter distribution and can be understood in terms of the growth of structure via gravitational instability in an expanding universe.},

The incidence of such {LLSs} per unit redshift, l(z)=dn/dz, at these redshifts is well described by a single power law, l(z) = C1 (1+z){\textasciicircum}gamma, with gamma=1.33 +/- 0.61 at z{\textless}2.6, or with gamma=1.83 +/- 0.21 over the redshift range 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 4.9. The incidence of {LLSs} per absorption distance, l(X), decreases by a factor of {\textasciitilde}1.5 over the {\textasciitilde}0.6 Gyr from z=4.9 to 3.5; l(X) evolves much more slowly at low redshifts, decreasing by a similar factor over the {\textasciitilde}8 Gyr from z=2.6 to 0.25.

Assuming {LLSs} are associated with individual galaxies, we show that the physical cross section of the optically thick envelopes of galaxies decreased by a factor of {\textasciitilde}9 from z{\textasciitilde}5 to 2 and has remained relatively constant since that time.

	abstract = {Rapid accretion of cold gas plays a crucial role in getting gas into galaxies. It has been suggested that this accretion proceeds along narrow streams that might also directly drive the turbulence in galactic gas, dynamical disturbances, and bulge formation. In cosmological simulations, however, it is impossible to isolate and hence disentangle the effect of accretion from internal instabilities and mergers. Moreover, in most cosmological simulations, the phase structure and turbulence in the {ISM} arising from stellar feedback are treated in a sub-grid manner, so that feedback cannot generate {ISM} turbulence. In this paper we therefore test the effects of cold streams in extremely high-resolution simulations of otherwise isolated galaxy disks using detailed models for star formation and feedback; we then include or exclude mock cold flows falling onto the galaxies with accretion rates, velocities and geometry set to maximize their effect on the disk. We find: (1) Turbulent velocity dispersions in gas disks are identical with or without the cold flow; the energy injected by the flow is dissipated where it meets the disk. (2) In runs without stellar feedback, the presence of a cold flow has essentially no effect on runaway local collapse, resulting in star formation rates ({SFRs}) that are far too large. (3) Disks in runs with feedback and cold flows have higher {SFRs}, but only insofar as they have more gas. (4) Because flows are extended relative to the disk, they do not trigger strong resonant responses and so induce weak morphological perturbation (bulge formation via instabilities is not accelerated). (5) However, flows can thicken the disk by direct contribution of out-of-plane streams. We conclude that while inflows are critical over cosmological timescales to determine the supply and angular momentum of gas disks, they have weak instantaneous dynamical effects on galaxies.},

	abstract = {We develop and implement numerical methods for including stellar feedback in galaxy-scale numerical simulations. Our models include simplified treatments of heating by Type I and Type {II} supernovae, gas recycling from young stars and asymptotic giant branch winds, heating from the shocked stellar winds, H {II} photoionization heating and radiation pressure from stellar photons. The energetics and time dependence associated with the feedback are taken directly from stellar evolution models. We implement these stellar feedback models in smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations with pc-scale resolution, modelling galaxies from Small Magellanic Cloud ({SMC}) like dwarfs and Milky Way ({MW}) analogues to massive z˜ 2 star-forming discs. In the absence of stellar feedback, gas cools rapidly and collapses without limit into dense sub-units, inconsistent with observations. By contrast, in all cases with feedback, the interstellar medium ({ISM}) quickly approaches a statistical steady state in which giant molecular clouds ({GMCs}) continuously form, disperse and re-form, leading to a multiphase {ISM}. In this paper, we quantify the properties of the {ISM} and {GMCs} in this self-regulated state. In a companion paper we study the galactic winds driven by stellar feedback. Our primary results on the structure of the {ISM} in star-forming galaxies include the following. 1. Star-forming galaxies generically self-regulate so that the cool, dense gas maintains Toomre's Q˜ 1. Most of the volume is occupied by relatively diffuse hot gas, while most of the mass is in dense {GMC} complexes created by self-gravity. The phase structure of the gas and the gas mass fraction at high densities are much more sensitive probes of the physics of stellar feedback than integrated quantities such as the Toomre Q or gas velocity dispersion. 2. Different stellar feedback mechanisms act on different spatial (and density) scales. Radiation pressure and H {II} gas pressure are critical for preventing runaway collapse of dense gas in {GMCs}. Shocked supernova ejecta and stellar winds dominate the dynamics of the volume-filling hot gas. However, this gas primarily vents out of the star-forming disc and contributes only modestly to the mid-plane {ISM} pressure. 3. The galaxy-averaged star formation rate is determined by feedback, with different mechanisms dominating in different galaxy types. For a given feedback efficiency, restricting star formation to molecular gas or modifying the cooling function has little effect on the star formation rate in the galaxies we model (including an {SMC}-mass dwarf). By contrast, changing the feedback mechanisms or assumed feedback efficiencies directly translates to shifts off of the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. 4. Self-gravity leads to {GMCs} with an approximately self-similar mass function ∝M-2, with a high-mass cut-off determined by the characteristic Jeans/Toomre mass of the system. In all of our galaxy models, {GMCs} live for a few dynamical times before they are disrupted by stellar feedback. The net star formation efficiency in {GMCs} ranges from ˜1 per cent in dwarfs and {MW}-like spirals to nearly ˜10 per cent in gas-rich rapidly star-forming galaxies. {GMCs} are approximately virialized, but there is a large dispersion in the virial parameter for a given {GMC} mass, and lower mass {GMCs} tend to be preferentially unbound.},

	abstract = {Feedback from massive stars is believed to play a critical role in shaping the galaxy mass function, the structure of the interstellar medium ({ISM}) in galaxies, and the slow conversion of gas into stars over many dynamical times. This paper is the first in a series studying stellar feedback in galaxy formation. We present a new numerical method for implementing stellar feedback via the momentum imparted to the {ISM} by radiation pressure, supernovae, and stellar winds. In contrast to the majority of the results in the literature, we do not artificially suppress cooling or 'turn off' the hydrodynamics for a subset of the gas: the gas can cool to {\textless}100K and so the {ISM} inevitably becomes highly inhomogeneous. For reasonable feedback efficiencies galaxies reach an approximate steady state in which gas collapses due to gravity to form giant molecular clouds and feedback disperses these dense regions back into the more diffuse {ISM}. This is true for a wide range of galaxy models, from {SMC}-like dwarfs and Milky-way analogues to z{\textasciitilde}2 clumpy disks. The resulting star formation efficiencies are consistent with the observed global Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Moreover, the star formation rates in our galaxy models are nearly independent of the numerically imposed high-density star formation efficiency and density threshold. This is a consequence of star formation regulated by stellar feedback; it enables our method to be more predictive than previous treatments. By contrast, without stellar feedback, the {ISM} experiences runaway collapse to very high densities and the global star formation rates exceed those observed by 1-2 orders of magnitude. This highlights the critical role that momentum in stellar feedback plays regulating star formation in galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present a numerical study of dark matter halo concentrations in \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} and self-similar cosmologies. We show that the relation between concentration, \$c\$, and peak height, \${\textbackslash}nu\$, exhibits the smallest deviations from universality if halo masses are defined with respect to the critical density of the universe. These deviations can be explained by the residual dependence of concentration on the local slope of the matter power spectrum, \$n\$, which affects both the normalization and shape of the \$c\$-\${\textbackslash}nu\$ relation. In particular, there is no well-defined floor in the concentration values. Instead, the minimum concentration depends on redshift: at fixed \${\textbackslash}nu\$, halos at higher \$z\$ experience steeper slopes \$n\$, and thus have lower minimum concentrations. We show that the concentrations in our simulations can be accurately described by a universal seven-parameter function of only \${\textbackslash}nu\$ and \$n\$. This model matches our \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} results to \${\textbackslash}lesssim 5{\textbackslash}\%\$ accuracy up to \$z = 6\$, and matches scale-free \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\} = 1\$ models to \${\textbackslash}lesssim 15{\textbackslash}\%\$. The model also reproduces the low concentration values of Earth--mass halos at \$z {\textbackslash}approx 30\$, and thus correctly extrapolates over \$16\$ orders of magnitude in halo mass. The predictions of our model differ significantly from all models previously proposed in the literature at high masses and redshifts. Our model is in excellent agreement with recent lensing measurements of cluster concentrations.},

In this work we present the freely available {MPI} parallel halo finder {AHF}. We provide a description of the algorithm and the strategy followed to handle large simulation data. We also describe the parameters a user may choose in order to influence the process of halo finding, as well as pointing out which parameters are crucial to ensure untainted results from the parallel approach.

Our implementation of {SPH} manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a {TreePM} algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10{\textasciicircum}10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10{\textasciicircum}5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological {SPH} simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. {GADGET}-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

In the absence of a strong {UV} flux, the gas is predominantly neutral and may form clouds with {HI} column density {NHI} {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}18 cm{\textasciicircum}-2. Due to their high densities and high {HI} column densities, these clouds are not destroyed by the onset of the {UV} background at a later time. Thus, if not disrupted by other processes, such as mergers into larger systems or `blow away' by supernovae, they will produce {LLS}. We show that the observed number density of {LLS} at high redshifts can well be reproduced by the survived `minihalos' in hierarchical clustering models such as the standard cold dark matter model. The number density of {LLS} in such a population increases with z even beyond the redshifts accessible to current observations and dies off quickly at z {\textless} 2. This population is distinct from other populations because the absorbing systems have small velocity widths and a close to primordial chemical composition. The existence of such a population requires that the reionization of the universe occurs late, at z {\textless} 20.},

	abstract = {Hydro cosmological simulations reveal that massive galaxies at high redshift are fed by long narrow streams of merging galaxies and a smoother component of cold gas. We post-process seven high-resolution simulated galaxies with radiative transfer to study the absorption characteristics of the gas in galaxies and streams, in comparison with the statistics of observed absorption-line systems. We find that much of the stream gas is ionized by {UV} radiation from background and local stellar sources, but still optically thick (N\_HI {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}17 cm{\textasciicircum}-2) so that the streams appear as Lyman-limit systems ({LLSs}). At z{\textgreater}3, the fraction of neutral gas in streams becomes non-negligible, giving rise to damped Lyman-alpha ({DLA}) absorbers as well. The gas in the central and incoming galaxies remains mostly neutral, responsible for {DLAs}. Within one (two) virial radii, the covering factor of optically thick gas is {\textless}25\% (10\%) for {LLSs} and {\textless}5\% (1\%) for {DLAs}, slowly declining with time following the universal expansion. Nevertheless, galaxies and their cold streams in the studied mass range, M\_vir = 10{\textasciicircum}10 - 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun, account for {\textgreater}30\% of the observed absorbers in the foreground of quasars, the rest possibly arising from smaller galaxies or the intergalactic medium. The mean metallicity in the streams is {\textasciitilde}1\% solar, much lower than in the galaxies. The simulated galaxies reproduce the Lyalpha-absorption equivalent widths observed around Lyman-break galaxies, but they severely underpredict the equivalent widths in metal lines, suggesting that the latter may arise from outflows. We conclude that the observed metal-poor {LLSs} are likely detections of the predicted cold streams. Revised analysis of the observed {LLSs} kinematics and simulations with more massive outflows in conjunction with the inflows may enable a clearer distinction between the signatures of the various gas modes.},

From a starting sample of 2473 quasars with zem=3.6-4.4, we analyze 469 spectra meeting strict seletion criteria for a total redshift path Dz=93.8 and identify 192 intervening systems at z{\textgreater}3.3. The incidence of tau{\textgreater}=2 {LLSs} per unit redshift, l(z), is well described by a single-power law at these redshifts: l(z) = C\_LLS [(1+z)/(1+z\_*)]{\textasciicircum}gamma, with z\_*=3.7, C\_LLS = 1.9+/-0.2, and gamma = 5.2+/-1.5 (68\% c.l.). These values are systematically lower than previous estimates (especially at z{\textless}4) but are consistent with recent measurements of the mean free path to ionizing radiation. Extrapolations of this power-law to z=0 are inconsistent with previous estimations of l(z) at z{\textless}1 and suggest a break at z{\textasciitilde}2, similar to that observed for the Lya forest. Our results also indicate that the systems giving rise to {LLS} absorption decrease by {\textasciitilde}50\% in comoving number density and/or physical size from z=4 to 3.3, perhaps due to an enhanced extragalactic ultraviolet background. The observations place an integral constraint on the {HI} frequency distribution f(N\_HI,X) and indicate that the power-law slope beta= dln[f(N,X)]/dln[N] is likely shallower than beta = -1 at N\_HI=10{\textasciicircum}18 cm{\textasciicircum}-2. Including other constraints on f(N\_HI,X) from the literature, we infer that beta is steeper than beta = -1.7 at N\_HI{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}15 cm{\textasciicircum}-2, implying at least two inflections in f(N\_HI,X). We also perform a survey for proximate {LLSs} ({PLLSs}) and find that l(z)\_PLLS is systematically lower {\textasciitilde}25\% than intervening systems. Finally, we estimate that systematic effects impose an uncertainty of 10-20\% in the l(z) measurements; these effects may limit the precision of all future surveys.},

Unfortunately, the cosmic web has only been extensively mapped at low-redshifts (\$z{\textless}1\$), using galaxy redshifts as tracers of the underlying density field. At \$z{\textgreater}1\$, the required galaxy densities are inaccessible for the foreseeable future, but 3D reconstructions of Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest absorption in closely-separated background {QSOs} and star-forming galaxies already offer a detailed window into \$z{\textbackslash}sim2-3\$ large-scale structure. We quantify the utility of such maps for studying the cosmic web by using realistic \$z=2.5\$ Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest simulations matched to observational properties of upcoming surveys. A deformation tensor-based analysis is used to classify voids, sheets, filaments and nodes in the flux, which is compared to those determined from the underlying dark matter field. We find an extremely good correspondence, with \$70{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the volume in the flux maps correctly classified relative to the dark matter web, and \$99{\textbackslash}\%\$ classified to within 1 eigenvalue. This compares favorably to the performance of galaxy-based classifiers with even the highest galaxy densities at low-redshift. We find that narrow survey geometries can degrade the cosmic web recovery unless the survey is \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 60{\textbackslash},h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\$ or \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 1{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{deg\}\$ on the sky. We also examine halo abundances as a function of the cosmic web, and find a clear dependence as a function of flux overdensity, but little explicit dependence on the cosmic web. These methods will provide a new window on cosmological environments of galaxies at this very special time in galaxy formation, "high noon", and on overall properties of cosmological structures at this epoch.},

	abstract = {In this article, we review a series of recent theoretical results regarding a conventional approach to the dark energy ({DE}) concept. This approach is distinguished among others for its simplicity and its physical relevance. By compromising General Relativity ({GR}) and Thermodynamics at cosmological scale, we end up with a model without {DE}. Instead, the Universe we are proposing is filled with a perfect fluid of self-interacting dark matter ({DM}), the volume elements of which perform hydrodynamic flows. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time in a cosmological framework that the energy of the cosmic fluid internal motions is also taken into account as a source of the universal gravitational field. As we demonstrate, this form of energy may compensate for the {DE} needed to compromise spatial flatness, while, depending on the particular type of thermodynamic processes occurring in the interior of the {DM} fluid (isothermal or polytropic), the Universe depicts itself as either decelerating or accelerating (respectively). In both cases, there is no disagreement between observations and the theoretical prediction of the distant supernovae ({SNe}) Type Ia distribution. In fact, the cosmological model with matter content in the form of a thermodynamically-involved {DM} fluid not only interprets the observational data associated with the recent history of Universe expansion, but also confronts successfully with every major cosmological issue (such as the age and the coincidence problems). In this way, depending on the type of thermodynamic processes in it, such a model may serve either for a conventional {DE} cosmology or for a viable alternative one.},

Previous studies have proposed that giant clumps might have an important role in the evolution of their host galaxy, particularly in building the central bulge. However, this depends on whether clumps live long enough to migrate from their original location in the disc or whether they get disrupted by their own stellar feedback before reaching the centre of the galaxy. We use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the {FIRE} (Feedback in Realistic Environments) project that implement explicit treatments of stellar feedback and {ISM} physics to study the properties of these clumps. We follow the evolution of giant clumps in a massive (stellar mass {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10.8 Msun at z=1), discy, gas-rich galaxy from redshift z{\textgreater}2 to z=1. Even though the clumpy phase of this galaxy lasts over a gigayear, individual gas clumps are short-lived, with mean lifetime of massive clumps of {\textasciitilde}20 Myr. During that time, they turn between 0.1\% and 20\% of their gas into stars before being disrupted, similar to local {GMCs}. Clumps with M{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}7 Msun account for {\textasciitilde}20\% of the total star formation in the galaxy during the clumpy phase, producing {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun of stars. We do not find evidence for net inward migration of clumps within the galaxy. The number of giant clumps and their mass decrease at lower redshifts, following the decrease in the overall gas fraction and star-formation rate.},

	abstract = {Observations reveal that a large amount of close binary systems have a finite eccentricity. The time-evolution of the orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity of mass-transferring eccentric binary systems is an important part of binary evolution theory and has been widely studied. However, various different approaches and assumptions on the subject have made the literature difficult to comprehend and comparisons between different orbital element time-evolution equations not easy to make. Consequently, no self-consistent treatment of this phase has been ever included in binary population synthesis codes. In this paper, we present a general formalism to derive the time-evolution equations of the binary orbital elements, treating mass-loss and mass-transfer as perturbations to the general two-body problem. We present the self-consistent form of the perturbing acceleration and the phase-dependent time-evolution equations for the orbital elements under different mass-loss/transfer processes. First, we study the cases of isotropic and anisotropic wind mass-loss. Then, we proceed with the non-isotropic ejection and accretion in conservative as well as non-conservative manner for both point masses and extended bodies. Comparison of the derived equations with similar work in the literature is made and explanation of the existing discrepancies is provided.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06593},
	abstract = {Finite eccentricities in mass-transferring eccentric binary systems can be explained taking into account mass-loss and mass-transfer processes that often occur in these systems. These processes can be treated as perturbations to the general two-body problem. The time-evolution equations for the semi-major axis and the eccentricity derived from perturbative methods are in general phase-dependent. The osculating semi-major axis and eccentricity change over the orbital timescale and they are not easy to implement in binary evolution codes like {MESA}. However, the secular orbital element evolution equations can be simplified averaging over the rapidly varying true anomalies. In this paper, we derive the secular time-evolution equations for the semi-major axis and the eccentricity for various mass-loss/transfer processes using either the adiabatic approximation or the assumption of delta-function mass-loss/transfer at periastron. We begin with the cases of isotropic and anisotropic wind mass-loss. We continue with conservative and non-conservative non-isotropic mass ejection/accretion (including {RLOF}) for both point-masses and extended bodies. We conclude with the case of phase-dependent mass accretion. Comparison of the derived equations with similar work in the literature is included and explanation of the existing discrepancies is provided.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03674},
	abstract = {We compare several common sub-grid implementations of {AGN} feedback, focusing on the effects of different triggering mechanisms and the differences between thermal and kinetic feedback. Our main result is that pure thermal feedback that is centrally injected behaves differently from feedback with even a small kinetic component. Specifically, pure thermal feedback results in excessive condensation and smothering of the {AGN} by cold gas because the feedback energy does not propagate to large enough radii. We do not see large differences between implementations of different triggering mechanisms, as long as the spatial resolution is sufficiently high, probably because all of the implementations tested here trigger strong {AGN} feedback under similar conditions. In order to assess the role of resolution, we vary the size of the "accretion zone" in which properties are measured to determine the {AGN} accretion rate and resulting feedback power. We find that a larger accretion zone results in steadier jets but can also allow too much cold-gas condensation in simulations with a Bondi-like triggering algorithm. We also vary the opening angle of jet precession and find that a larger precession angle causes more of the jet energy to thermalize closer to the {AGN}, thereby producing results similar to pure thermal feedback. Our simulations confirm that {AGN} can regulate the thermal state of cool-core galaxy clusters and maintain the core in a state that is marginally susceptable to thermal instability and precipitation.},

	abstract = {We investigate the relative importance of two galactic outflow suppression mechanisms : a) Cosmological infall of the intergalactic gas onto the galaxy, and b) the existence of a hot circumgalactic medium ({CGM}). Considering only radial motion, the infall reduces the speed of outflowing gas and even halts the outflow, depending on the mass and redshift of the galaxy. For star forming galaxies there exists an upper mass limit beyond which outflows are suppressed by the gravitational field of the galaxy. We find that infall can reduce this upper mass limit approximately by a factor of two (independent of the redshift). Massive galaxies (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) host large reservoir of hot, diffuse {CGM} around the central part of the galaxy. The {CGM} acts as a barrier between the infalling and outflowing gas and provides an additional source of outflow suppression. We find that at low redshifts (\$z{\textbackslash}lesssim3.5\$), the {CGM} is more effective than the infall in suppressing the outflows. Together, these two processes give a mass range in which galaxies are unable to have effective outflows. We also discuss the impact of outflow suppression on the enrichment history of the galaxy and its environment.},

These allow for efficient and reliable determinations of chaos indicators such as the Maximal Lyapunov characteristic Exponent ({MLE}) and the Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits ({MEGNO}). In this paper we lay out the theoretical framework to extend the idea of variational equations to higher order. We explicitly derive the differential equations that govern the evolution of second-order variations in the N-body problem. Going to second order opens the door to new applications, including optimization algorithms that require the first and second derivatives of the solution, like the classical Newton's method. Typically, these methods have faster convergence rates than derivative-free methods. Derivatives are also required for Riemann manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods which provide significantly shorter correlation times than standard methods. Such improved optimization methods can be applied to anything from radial-velocity/transit-timing-variation fitting to spacecraft trajectory optimization to asteroid deflection. We provide an implementation of first and second-order variational equations for the publicly available {REBOUND} integrator package. Our implementation allows the simultaneous integration of any number of first and second-order variational equations with the high-accuracy {IAS}15 integrator. We also provide routines to generate consistent and accurate initial conditions without the need for finite differencing.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05040},
	abstract = {Shear peak statistics has gained a lot of attention recently as a practical alternative to the two point statistics for constraining cosmological parameters. We perform a shear peak statistics analysis of the Dark Energy Survey ({DES}) Science Verification ({SV}) data, using weak gravitational lensing measurements from a 139 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ field. We measure the abundance of peaks identified in aperture mass maps, as a function of their signal-to-noise ratio, in the signal-to-noise range \$0{\textless}{\textbackslash}mathcal S / {\textbackslash}mathcal N{\textless}4\$. To predict the peak counts as a function of cosmological parameters we use a suite of \$N\$-body simulations spanning 158 models with varying \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$, fixing \$w = -1\$, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\} = 0.04\$, \$h = 0.7\$ and \$n\_s=1\$, to which we have applied the {DES} {SV} mask and redshift distribution. In our fiducial analysis we measure \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{8\}({\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}/0.3){\textasciicircum}\{0.6\}=0.77 {\textbackslash}pm 0.07\$, after marginalising over the shear multiplicative bias and the error on the mean redshift of the galaxy sample. We introduce models of intrinsic alignments, blending, and source contamination by cluster members. These models indicate that peaks with \${\textbackslash}mathcal S / {\textbackslash}mathcal N{\textgreater}4\$ would require significant corrections, which is why we do not include them in our analysis. We compare our results to the cosmological constraints from the two point analysis on the {SV} field and find them to be in good agreement in both the central value and its uncertainty. We discuss prospects for future peak statistics analysis with upcoming {DES} data.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04863},
	abstract = {We present the stellar mass (\$M\_\{*\}\$)--gas-phase metallicity relation ({MZR}) and its scatter at intermediate redshifts (\$0.5{\textbackslash}leq z{\textbackslash}leq0.7\$) for 1381 field galaxies collected from deep spectroscopic surveys. The star formation rate ({SFR}) and color at a given \$M\_\{*\}\$ of this magnitude-limited (\$R{\textbackslash}lesssim24\$ {AB}) sample are representative of normal star-forming galaxies. For masses below \$10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, our sample of 237 galaxies is \${\textbackslash}sim\$10 times larger than those in previous studies beyond the local universe. This huge gain in sample size enables superior constraints on the {MZR} and its scatter in the low-mass regime. We find a power-law {MZR} at \$10{\textasciicircum}\{8\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textless} M\_\{*\} {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$: \$\{12+log(O/H) = (5.83{\textbackslash}pm0.19) + (0.30{\textbackslash}pm0.02)log(M\_\{*\}/M\_{\textbackslash}odot)\}\$. Our {MZR} shows good agreement with others measured at similar redshifts in the literature in the intermediate and massive regimes, but is shallower than the extrapolation of the {MZRs} of others to masses below \$10{\textasciicircum}\{9\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. The {SFR} dependence of the {MZR} in our sample is weaker than that found for local galaxies (known as the Fundamental Metallicity Relation). Compared to a variety of theoretical models, the slope of our {MZR} for low-mass galaxies agrees well with predictions incorporating supernova energy-driven winds. Being robust against currently uncertain metallicity calibrations, the scatter of the {MZR} serves as a powerful diagnostic of the stochastic history of gas accretion, gas recycling, and star formation of low-mass galaxies. Our major result is that the scatter of our {MZR} increases as \$M\_\{*\}\$ decreases. Our result implies that either the scatter of the baryonic accretion rate or the scatter of the \$M\_\{*\}\$--\$M\_\{halo\}\$ relation increases as \$M\_\{*\}\$ decreases. Moreover, our measures of scatter at \$z=0.7\$ appears consistent with that found for local galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the iron abundance in the hot gas surrounding galaxy groups and clusters. To do this, we first compile and homogenise a large dataset of 79 low-redshift ({\textbar}z{\textbar} = 0.03) systems (159 individual measurements) from the literature. Our analysis accounts for differences in aperture size, solar abundance, and cosmology, and scales all measurements using customised radial profiles for the temperature (T), gas density, and iron abundance (Z). We then compare this dataset to groups and clusters in the L-Galaxies galaxy evolution model. Our homogenised dataset reveals a tight T-Z relation for clusters, with a scatter in Z of only 0.10 dex and a slight negative gradient. After examining potential measurement biases, we conclude that at least some of this negative gradient has a physical origin. Our model suggests greater accretion of hydrogen in the hottest systems, via stripping of gas from infalling satellites, as a cause. At lower temperatures, L-Galaxies over-estimates Z in groups, indicating that metal-rich gas removal (via e.g. {AGN} feedback) is required. L-Galaxies provides a reasonable match to the observed Z in the intracluster medium ({ICM}) of the hottest clusters from at least z {\textasciitilde} 1.3 to 0.3. This is achieved without needing to modify any of the galactic chemical evolution ({GCE}) model parameters. However, the Z in intermediate-temperature clusters appears to be under-estimated in our model at z = 0. The merits and problems with modifying the {GCE} modelling to correct this are discussed.},

	abstract = {We provide a discussion of some main ideas in our project about the physical foundation of the time concept in cosmology. It is standard to point to the Planck scale (located at \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-43\}\$ seconds after a fictitious "Big Bang" point) as a limit for how far back we may extrapolate the standard cosmological model. In our work we have suggested that there are several other (physically motivated) interesting limits -- located at least thirty orders of magnitude before the Planck time -- where the physical basis of the cosmological model and its time concept is progressively weakened. Some of these limits are connected to phase transitions in the early universe which gradually undermine the notion of 'standard clocks' widely employed in cosmology. Such considerations lead to a 'scale problem' for time which becomes particularly acute above the electroweak phase transition (before \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-11\}\$ seconds). Other limits are due to problems of building up a cosmological reference frame, or even contemplating a sensible notion of proper time, if the early universe constituents become too quantum. This 'quantum problem' for time arises e.g. if a pure quantum phase is contemplated at the beginning of inflation at, say, \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-34\}\$ seconds.},

	abstract = {The subsequent coalescence of low--mass halos over cosmic time is thought to be the major formation channel of massive spiral galaxies like the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). The gaseous halo of a massive galaxy is considered to be the reservoir of baryonic matter persistently fueling the star formation in the disk. Because of its proximity, M31 is the ideal object for studying the structure of the halo gas in great detail. Using the latest neutral atomic hydrogen ({HI}) data of the Effelsberg-Bonn {HI} Survey ({EBHIS}) allows comprising a comprehensive inventory of gas associated with M31. The primary aim is to differentiate between physical structures belonging to the Milky Way Galaxy and M31 and accordingly to test the presence of a M31 neutral gaseous halo. Analyzing the spatially fully sampled {EBHIS} data makes it feasible to trace coherent {HI} structures in space and radial velocity. To disentangle Milky Way and M31 {HI} emission we use a new approach, along with the traditional path of setting an upper radial velocity limit, by calculating a difference second moment map. We argue that M31's disk is physically connected to an asymmetric {HI} halo of tens of kpc size, the M31 cloud. We confirm the presence of a coherent low-velocity {HI} filament located in between M31 and M33 aligned at the sky with the clouds at systemic velocity. The physical parameters of the {HI} filament are comparable to those of the {HI} clouds at systemic velocity. We also detected an irregularly shaped {HI} cloud that is is positionally located close to but offset from the stellar body of And {XIX}.},

	abstract = {Measuring the large-scale volume-weighted peculiar velocity statistics from galaxy and simulated halo/particle velocity data suffers sampling artifacts from the velocity assignment methods. In previous work [Y. Yu, J. Zhang, Y. Jing, and P. Zhang, Phys. Rev. D 92, 083527 (2015)], we proposed Kriging interpolation to obtain the volume-weighted velocity field and found that the most straightforward Kriging does not perform over the existing methods in the literature. In this work we improve the Kriging performance by considering more delicate Kriging. The improvement mainly comes from considering the anisotropy in the input variogram prior for Kriging. We find that the improvement is obvious for low sampling density cases (\$n\_P{\textbackslash}lesssim 6{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}(h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} \{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}){\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$), in the sense of the alleviation of severe power spectrum suppression in small scales. It pushes the scale of reliable measurement by a factor \${\textbackslash}sim 1.6\$. Furthermore, the dependence on variogram prior is significantly weakened. Comparing to the most straightforward Kriging, the more delicate one reduces the impact of variogram priors by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 2\$ for \$n\_P{\textbackslash}lesssim 6{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}(h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} \{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}){\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$.

By these measures, predictions from a fixed pair can be as precise on non-linear scales as an average over 50 traditional simulations. The fixing procedure introduces a non-Gaussian correction to the initial conditions; we give an analytic argument showing why the simulations are still able to predict the mean properties of the Gaussian ensemble.

Thus, it is not possible to understand the astrophysical universe without a detailed knowledge of the dynamics of magnetised fluids. Fluid dynamics is, however, a notoriously tricky subject, in which it is all too easy for one's a priori intuition to go astray. In this review, we seek to guide the reader through a series of illuminating yet deceptive problems, all with an enlightening twist. We cover a broad range of topics including the instabilities acting in accretion discs, the hydrodynamics governing the convective zone of the Sun, the magnetic shielding of a cooling galaxy cluster, and the behaviour of thermal instabilities and evaporating clouds. The aim of this review is to surprise and intrigue even veteran astrophysical theorists with an idiosynchratic choice of problems and counterintuitive results. At the same time, we endeavour to bring forth the fundamental ideas, to set out important assumptions, and to describe carefully whatever novel techniques may be appropriate to the problem at hand. By beginning at the beginning, and analysing a wide variety of astrophysical settings, we seek not only to make this review suitable for fluid dynamic veterans, but to engage novice recruits as well with what we hope will be an unusual and instructive introduction to the subject.},

We find that the column density of circumgalactic O {VI} is maximal in the haloes associated with Lstar galaxies, because their virial temperatures are close to the temperature at which the ionization fraction of O {VI} peaks (T{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}5.5 K). The higher virial temperature of group haloes ({\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}6 K) promotes oxygen to higher ionization states, suppressing the O {VI} column density. The observed {NO} {VI}-{sSFR} correlation therefore does not imply a causal link, but reflects the changing characteristic ionization state of oxygen as halo mass is increased. In spite of the mass-dependence of the oxygen ionization state, the most abundant circumgalactic oxygen ion in both Lstar and group haloes is O {VII}; O {VI} accounts for only 0.1\% of the oxygen in group haloes and 0.9-1.3\% with Lstar haloes. Nonetheless, the metals traced by O {VI} absorbers represent a fossil record of the feedback history of galaxies over a Hubble time; their characteristic epoch of ejection corresponds to z {\textgreater} 1 and much of the ejected metal mass resides beyond the virial radius of galaxies. For both Lstar and group galaxies, more of the oxygen produced and released by stars resides in the circumgalactic medium (within twice the virial radius) than in the stars and {ISM} of the galaxy.},

	abstract = {Current Voronoi based moving mesh hydro codes suffer from "grid noise". We identify the cause of this noise as the volume inconsistency error, where the volume that is transferred between cells is inconsistent with the hydrodynamical calculations. As a result, the codes do not achieve second order convergence. In this paper we describe how a simple fix allows Voronoi based moving mesh codes to attain second order convergence. The fix is based on the understanding that the volume exchanged between cells should be consistent with the hydrodynamical calculations. We benchmark our fix with three test problems and show that it can significantly improve the computational accuracy. We also examine the effect of initial mesh initialization and present an improved model for the Green-Gauss based gradient estimator.},

We examine the global molecular gas content of clouds, and investigate the effect of using {CO} or H2 densities to define the {GMCs}. We find that {CO} can reliably trace the high-density H2 gas, but misses less dense H2 clouds. We also investigate the effect of using 3D {CO} densities versus {CO} emission with an observer's perspective, and find that {CO}-emission clouds trace well the peaks of the actual {GMCs} in 3D, but can miss the lower density molecular gas between density peaks which is often {CO}-dark. Thus the {CO} emission typically traces smaller clouds within larger {GMC} complexes. We also investigate the effect of the galactic environment (in particular the presence of spiral arms), on the distribution of {GMC} properties, and we find that the mean properties are similar between arm and inter-arm clouds, but the tails of some distributions are indicative of intrinsic differences in the environment. We find highly filamentary clouds (similar to the giant molecular filaments of our Galaxy) exclusively in the inter-arm region, formed by galactic shear. We also find that the most massive {GMC} complexes are located in the arm, and that as a consequence of more frequent cloud interactions/mergers in the arm, arm clouds are more sub-structured and have higher velocity dispersions than inter-arm clouds.},

	abstract = {Studies of dynamical stability (chaotic versus regular motion) in galactic dynamics often rely on static analytical models of the total gravitational potential. Potentials based upon self-consistent N-body simulations offer more realistic models, fully incorporating the time-dependent nature of the systems. Here we aim at analysing the fractions of chaotic motion within different morphological components of the galaxy. We wish to investigate how the presence of chaotic orbits evolves with time, and how their spatial distribution is associated with morphological features of the galaxy. We employ a time-dependent analytical potential model that was derived from an N-body simulation of a strongly barred galaxy. With this analytical potential we may follow the dynamical evolution of ensembles of orbits. Using the Generalized Alignment Index ({GALI}) chaos detection method, we study the fraction of chaotic orbits, sampling the dynamics of both the stellar disc and of the dark matter halo. Within the stellar disc, the global trend is for chaotic motion to decrease in time, specially in the region of the bar. We scrutinized the different changes of regime during the evolution (orbits that are permanently chaotic, permanently regular, those that begin regular and end chaotic, and those that begin chaotic and end regular), tracing the types of orbits back to their common origins. Within the dark matter halo, chaotic motion also decreases globally in time. The inner halo (r {\textless} 5 kpc) is where most chaotic orbits are found and it is the only region where chaotic orbits outnumber regular orbits, in the early evolution.},

(Jungle universe : {arXiv}:1306.1037) In addition to numerical simulations illustrating this behaviour among the barotropic fluids filling the universe, we analytically pinpoint that effective time-dependent barotropic indices can arise from a physical coupling between those fluids whose dynamics could then look like that of another type of cosmic fluid, such as a cosmological constant. Since the nature of dark energy is still unknown, this dynamical approach could help understanding some of the properties of dark matter and dark energy at large cosmological scales.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02285},
	abstract = {(abridged) The large-scale distribution of galaxies is generally analyzed using the two-point correlation function. However, this statistic does not capture the topology of the distribution, and it is necessary to resort to higher order correlations to break degeneracies. We demonstrate that an alternate approach using network analysis can discriminate between topologically different distributions that have similar two-point correlations. We investigate two galaxy point distributions, one produced by a cosmological simulation and the other by a L{\textbackslash}'evy walk. For the cosmological simulation, we adopt the redshift \$z = 0.58\$ slice from Illustris (Vogelsberger et al. 2014A) and select galaxies with stellar masses greater than \$10{\textasciicircum}8\$\$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. The two point correlation function of these simulated galaxies follows a single power-law, \${\textbackslash}xi(r) {\textbackslash}sim r{\textasciicircum}\{-1.5\}\$. Then, we generate L{\textbackslash}'evy walks matching the correlation function and abundance with the simulated galaxies. We find that, while the two simulated galaxy point distributions have the same abundance and two point correlation function, their spatial distributions are very different; most prominently, {\textbackslash}emph\{filamentary structures\}, absent in L{\textbackslash}'evy fractals. To quantify these missing topologies, we adopt network analysis tools and measure diameter, giant component, and transitivity from networks built by a conventional friends-of-friends recipe with various linking lengths. Unlike the abundance and two point correlation function, these network quantities reveal a clear separation between the two simulated distributions; therefore, the galaxy distribution simulated by Illustris is not a L{\textbackslash}'evy fractal quantitatively. We find that the described network quantities offer an efficient tool for discriminating topologies and for comparing observed and theoretical distributions.},

The primary objectives of the survey are (1) to determine the incidence, extent, and covering factor of extended gaseous envelopes of luminous galaxies and (2) to determine the fraction of Ly(alpha) absorption systems that arise in luminous galaxies. The goal of the survey is to identify in each field under construction all objects with apparent r-band magnitudes satisfying r less than 21.5 within angular distances to the {QSOs} satisfying 0 less than 1.3'. The current observations cover six fields and are 37\% complete to the goal ofthe survey. These observations identify 46 galaxies at redshifts spanning z = 0.0700-0.5526 and at impact parameters to the {QSOs} spanning rho = 16.6-346.9/h kpc. Of these galaxies, 11 are coincident in redshift with absorption systems and 21 do not give rise to absorption to within sensitive upper limits. Nine galaxies are coincident in redshift with 'Ly(alpha)-forest' absorption systems that show Ly(alpha) absorption but no corresponding metal-line absorption, and two galaxies are coincident in redshift with C {IV} absorption systems that show both Ly(alpha) and C {IV} absorption. Various lines of evidence demonstrate that the coincident galaxies are responsible for the corresponding absorption systems and are not present as the result of chance coincidence or merely spatial correlated with the absorption systems. The most important evidence is that there exists a statistical anti-correlation between Ly(aplha) rest-frame equivalent width and the impact parameter. Each of five galaxies with rho = 70-160/h kpc give rise to Ly(alpha) absorption, and just one of nine galaxies with rho greater than 70-160/h kpc gives rise to Ly(alpha) absorption. At least eight of 23 Ly(alpha) absorption systems arise in galaxies. On the basis of these results we reach the following conclusions: (1) At z less than or approximately = 1 most luminous galaxies are surrounded by extended gaseous envelopes of approximately = 160/h kpc radius and of roughly unit covering factor. This conclusion confirms previous speculation that normal luminous galaxies possess extended gaseous halos or extended gaseous disks. (2) At z less than or approximately = 1 the fraction of Ly(aplha) absorption systems-including Ly(alpha)-forest absorption systems-that arise in luminous galaxies is at least 0.32 +/- 0.10 and may be as high as 0.60 +/- 0.19. This conclusion runs contrary to the longstanding belief that Ly(alpha)-forest absorption systems arise in intergalactic clouds.},

It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disk galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies.

In this paper, we augment our previous analysis of the systematic properties of starburst-driven galactic outflows by expanding our sample to include a rare population of starbursts with exceptionally high outflow velocities. In principle, these could be a qualitatively different phenomenon from more typical outflows. However, we find that instead these starbursts lie on, or along the extrapolation of, the trends defined by the more typical systems studied previously by us. We exploit the wide dynamic range provided by this new sample to determine scaling relations of outflow velocity with galaxy stellar mass (M*), circular velocity, star-formation rate ({SFR}), {SFR}/M*, and {SFR}/area. We argue that these results can be accommodated within the general interpretational framework we previously advocated, in which a population of ambient interstellar or circum-galactic clouds is accelerated by the combined forces of gravity and the momentum flux from the starburst. We show that this simple physical picture is consistent with both the strong cosmological evolution of galactic outflows in typical star-forming galaxies and the paucity of such galaxies with spectra showing inflows. We also present simple parameterizations of these results that can be implemented in theoretical models and numerical simulations of galaxy evolution.},

The Lagrangian hydrodynamics approach and individual time steps for gas particles give the algorithm a large dynamic range, which is essential for studies of galaxy formation in a cosmological context. The code incorporates radiative cooling for an optically thin, primordial composition gas in ionization equilibrium with a user-specified ultraviolet background. We adopt a phenomenological prescription for star formation that gradually turns cold, dense, Jeans-unstable gas into collisionless stars, returning supernova feedback energy to the surrounding medium. In {CDM} simulations, some of the baryons that fall into dark matter potential wells dissipate their acquired thermal energy and condense into clumps with roughly galactic masses. The resulting galaxy population is insensitive to assumptions about star formation; we obtain similar baryonic mass functions and galaxy correlation functions from simulations with star formation and from simulations without star formation in which we identify galaxies directly from the cold, dense gas.},

Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a re-determination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new 3-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from {LTE} whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and neon compared with the widely-used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the solar neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

	abstract = {Low-mass "dwarf" galaxies represent the most significant challenges to the cold dark matter ({CDM}) model of cosmological structure formation. Because these faint galaxies are (best) observed within the Local Group ({LG}) of the Milky Way ({MW}) and Andromeda (M31), understanding their formation in such an environment is critical. We present first results from the Latte Project: the Milky Way on {FIRE} (Feedback in Realistic Environments). This simulation models the formation of a {MW}-mass galaxy to z = 0 within {LCDM} cosmology, including dark matter, gas, and stars at unprecedented resolution: baryon particle mass of 7070 Msun with gas kernel/softening that adapts down to 1 pc (with a median of 25 - 60 pc at z = 0). Latte was simulated using the {GIZMO} code with a mesh-free method for accurate hydrodynamics and the {FIRE}-2 model for star formation and explicit feedback within a multi-phase interstellar medium. For the first time, Latte self-consistently resolves the spatial scales corresponding to half-light radii of dwarf galaxies that form around a {MW}-mass host down to Mstar {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}5 Msun. Latte's population of dwarf galaxies agrees with the {LG} across a broad range of properties: (1) distributions of stellar masses and stellar velocity dispersions (dynamical masses), including their joint relation; (2) the mass-metallicity relation; and (3) a diverse range of star-formation histories, including their mass dependence. Thus, Latte produces a realistic population of dwarf galaxies at Mstar {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}5 Msun that does not suffer from the "missing satellites" or "too big to fail" problems of small-scale structure formation. We conclude that baryonic physics can reconcile observed dwarf galaxies with standard {LCDM} cosmology.},

	abstract = {In recent years, millisecond duration radio signals originating from distant galaxies appear to have been discovered in the so-called Fast Radio Bursts. These signals are dispersed according to a precise physical law and this dispersion is a key observable quantity which, in tandem with a redshift measurement, can be used for fundamental physical investigations. While every fast radio burst has a dispersion measurement, none before now have had a redshift measurement, due to the difficulty in pinpointing their celestial coordinates. Here we present the discovery of a fast radio burst and the identification of a fading radio transient lasting \${\textbackslash}sim 6\$ days after the event, which we use to identify the host galaxy; we measure the galaxy's redshift to be \$z=0.492{\textbackslash}pm0.008\$. The dispersion measure and redshift, in combination, provide a direct measurement of the cosmic density of ionised baryons in the intergalactic medium of \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{IGM}\}\}=4.9 {\textbackslash}pm 1.3{\textbackslash}\%\$, in agreement with the expectation from {WMAP}, and including all of the so-called "missing baryons". The \${\textbackslash}sim6\$-day transient is largely consistent with a short gamma-ray burst radio afterglow, and its existence and timescale do not support progenitor models such as giant pulses from pulsars, and supernovae. This contrasts with the interpretation of another recently discovered fast radio burst, suggesting there are at least two classes of bursts.},

	abstract = {Measurement of the evolution of both active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) and star-formation in galaxies underpins our understanding of galaxy evolution over cosmic time. Radio continuum observations can provide key information on these two processes, in partic-ular via the mechanical feedback produced by radio jets in {AGN}, and via an unbiased dust-independent measurement of star-formation rates. In this paper we determine radio luminosity functions at 325 {MHz} for a sample of {AGN} and star-forming galax-ies by matching a 138 deg 2 radio survey conducted with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope ({GMRT}), with optical imaging and redshifts from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly ({GAMA}) survey. We find that the radio luminosity function at 325 {MHz} for star-forming galaxies closely follows that measured at 1.4 {GHz}. By fitting the {AGN} radio luminosity function out to z = 0.5 as a double power law, and parametrizing the evolution as Φ ∝ (1 + z) k , we find evolution parameters of k = 0.92 ± 0.95 assuming pure density evolution and k = 2.13 ± 1.96 assuming pure luminosity evolution. We find that the Low Excitation Radio Galaxies are the dominant population in space density at lower luminosities. Comparing our 325 {MHz} observations with radio con-tinuum imaging at 1.4 {GHz}, we determine separate radio luminosity functions for steep and flat-spectrum {AGN}, and show that the beamed population of flat-spectrum sources in our sample can be shifted in number density and luminosity to coincide with the un-beamed population of steep-spectrum sources, as is expected in the orientation based unification of {AGN}.},

	abstract = {We use spectroscopy of close pairs of quasars to study diffuse gas in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) surrounding a sample of 40 Damped Lya systems ({DLAs}). The primary sightline in each quasar pair probes an intervening {DLA} in the redshift range 1.6 {\textless} z\_DLA {\textless} 3.6, such that the second quasar sightline then probes Lya, {CII}, {SiII}, and {CIV} absorption in the {CGM} transverse to the {DLA} to projected distances \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}perp\} {\textless} 300\$ kpc. Analysis of the Lya profiles in these {CGM} sightlines constrains the covering fraction (f\_C) of optically thick {HI} (having column density N\_HI {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}17.2 cm{\textasciicircum}-2) to be greater than {\textasciitilde}30\% within \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}perp\} {\textless} 200\$ kpc of {DLAs}. Strong {SiII} 1526 absorption with equivalent width W\_1526 {\textgreater} 0.2 Ang occurs with an incidence f\_C (W\_1526 {\textgreater} 0.2 Ang) = 20(+12/-8)\% within \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}perp\}{\textless}100\$ kpc, indicating that low-ionization metal absorption associated with {DLAs} probes material at a physical distance R\_3D {\textless} 30 kpc. However, we find that strong {CIV} 1548 absorption is ubiquitous in these environments (f\_C (W\_1548 {\textgreater} 0.2 Ang) = 57(+12/-13)\% within \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}perp\} {\textless} 100\$ kpc), and in addition exhibits a high degree of kinematic coherence on scales up to {\textasciitilde}175 kpc. We infer that this high-ionization material arises predominantly in large, quiescent structures extending beyond the scale of the {DLA} host dark matter halos rather than in ongoing galactic winds. The Lya equivalent width in the {DLA}-{CGM} is anticorrelated with \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}perp\}\$ at {\textgreater}98\% confidence, suggesting that {DLAs} arise close to the centers of their host halos rather than on their outskirts. Finally, the average Lya, {CII} and {CIV} equivalent widths are consistent with those measured around z{\textasciitilde}2 Lyman Break Galaxies. Assuming that {DLAs} trace a galaxy population with lower masses and luminosities, this finding implies that the absorption strength of cool circumgalactic material has a weak dependence on dark matter halo mass for M\_h {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}12 M\_sun.},

We stack spectra of \${\textbackslash}sim\$200,000 star-forming galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in bins of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$ and {SFR} offset from the star forming main sequence to measure the weak emission lines needed to apply the direct method.

The N2O2 diagnostic is the least subject to systematic biases. We apply the diagnostics to galaxies in the local universe and investigate the \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$-\$Z\$-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$ relation. The N2 and O3N2 diagnostics suggest the {SFR} dependence of the \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$-\$Z\$-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$ relation varies with both \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}log({SSFR})\$, whereas the N2O2 diagnostic suggests a nearly constant dependence on {SFR}. We apply our calibrations to a sample of high redshift galaxies from the literature, and find them to be metal poor relative to local galaxies with similar \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$ and {SFR}. The calibrations do reproduce direct method abundances of the local analogs.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01099},
	abstract = {The relation between galaxies and dark matter halos reflects the combined effects of many distinct physical processes. Observations indicate that the \$z=0\$ stellar mass-halo mass ({SMHM}) relation has remarkably small scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass (\${\textbackslash}lesssim\$ 0.2 dex) with little dependence on halo mass. We investigate the origins of this scatter by combining N-body simulations with observational constraints on the {SMHM} relation. We find that at the group and cluster scale (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) the scatter due purely to hierarchical assembly is \${\textbackslash}approx0.16\$ dex, which is comparable to recent direct observational estimates. At lower masses, mass buildup since \$z{\textbackslash}approx2\$ is driven largely by in-situ growth. We include a model for the in-situ buildup of stellar mass and find that an intrinsic scatter in this growth channel of \$0.2\$ dex produces a relation between scatter and halo mass that is consistent with observations from \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textless}M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}\{14.75\}\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. The approximately constant scatter across a wide range of halo masses at \$z=0\$ thus appears to be a coincidence as it is determined largely by in-situ growth at low masses and by hierarchical assembly at high masses. These results indicate that the scatter in the {SMHM} relation can provide unique insight into the regularity of the galaxy formation process.},

	abstract = {We present the first large-scale, full radiative transfer simulations of the reionization of the intergalactic medium in the presence of Lyman-limit systems ({LLSs}). To illustrate the impact of {LLS} opacity, possibly missed by previous simulations, we add either a uniform or spatially-varying hydrogen bound-free opacity. This opacity, implemented as the mean free path (mfp) of the ionizing photons, extrapolates the observed, post-reionization redshift dependence into the epoch of reionization. In qualitative agreement with previous studies, we find that at late times the presence of {LLSs} slows down the ionization fronts, and alters the size distribution of H {II} regions. We quantitatively characterize the size distribution and morphological evolution of H {II} regions and examine the effects of the {LLSs} on the redshifted 21-cm signal from the patchy reionization. The presence of {LLSs} extends the ionization history by \${\textbackslash}Delta z {\textbackslash}sim 0.8\$. The {LLS} absorbers significantly impede the late-time growth of the H {II} regions. The position dependent {LLS} distribution slows reionization further and additionally limits the late growth of the ionized regions. However, there is no "freeze out" of the H {II} regions and the largest regions grow to the size of the simulation volume. The 21-cm power spectra show that at large scales the power drops by a factor of 2 for 50\% and 75\% ionization stages (at \$k = 0.1\$ \${\textbackslash}text\{h\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}text\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} \$) reflecting the limiting effect of the {LLSs} on the growth of ionized patches. The statistical observables such as the {RMS} of the brightness temperature fluctuations and the peak amplitudes of the 21-cm power spectra at large-scales (\$k = 0.05 - 0.1\$ \${\textbackslash}text\{h\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}text\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} \$) are diminished by the presence of {LLS}.},

	title = {An instability of feedback regulated star formation in galactic nuclei},
	volume = {000},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07186},
	abstract = {We examine the stability of feedback-regulated star formation ({SF}) in galactic nuclei and contrast it to {SF} in extended discs. In galactic nuclei the dynamical time becomes shorter than the time over which feedback from young stars evolves. We argue analytically that the balance between stellar feedback and gravity is unstable in this regime. We study this using numerical simulations with pc-scale resolution and explicit stellar feedback taken from stellar evolution models. The nuclear gas mass, young stellar mass, and {SFR} within the central {\textasciitilde}100 pc (the short-timescale regime) never reach steady-state, but instead go through dramatic, oscillatory cycles. Stars form until a critical surface density of young stars is present (such that feedback overwhelms gravity), at which point they begin to expel gas from the nucleus. Since the dynamical times are shorter than the stellar evolution times, the stars do not die as the gas is expelled, but continue to push, triggering a runaway quenching of star formation in the nucleus. However the expelled gas is largely not unbound from the galaxy, but goes into a galactic fountain which re-fills the nuclear region after the massive stars from the previous burst cycle have died off ({\textasciitilde}50 Myr timescale). On large scales ({\textgreater}1 kpc), the galaxy-scale gas content and {SFR} is more stable. We examine the consequences of this episodic nuclear star formation for the Kennicutt-Schmidt ({KS}) relation: while a tight {KS} relation exists on {\textasciitilde}1 kpc scales in good agreement with observations, the scatter increases dramatically in smaller apertures centered on galactic nuclei.},

	abstract = {Observations of quasar pairs reveal that quasar host halos at z{\textasciitilde}2 have large covering fractions of cool dense gas ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}60\% for Lyman limit systems within a projected virial radius). Most simulations have so far failed to explain these large observed covering fractions. We analyze a new set of 15 simulated massive halos with explicit stellar feedback from the {FIRE} project, covering the halo mass range M\_h{\textasciitilde}2x10{\textasciicircum}12-10{\textasciicircum}13 Msun at z=2. This extends our previous analysis of the circum-galactic medium of high-redshift galaxies to more massive halos. Feedback from active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) is not included in these simulations. We find covering fractions consistent with those observed around z{\textasciitilde}2 quasars. The large {HI} covering fractions arise from star formation-driven galactic winds, including winds from low-mass satellite galaxies that interact with the cosmological infalling filaments in which they are typically embedded. The simulated covering fractions increase with both halo mass and redshift over the ranges covered, as well as with resolution. Our simulations predict that galaxies occupying dark matter halos of mass similar to quasars but without a luminous {AGN} should have Lyman limit system covering fractions comparable to quasars. This prediction can be tested by measuring covering fractions transverse to sub-millimeter galaxies or to more quiescent galaxies selected based on their high stellar mass.},

	abstract = {We present analytic calculations of angular momentum transport and gas inflow in galaxies, from scales of ˜ kpc to deep inside the potential of a central massive black hole ({BH}). We compare these analytic calculations to numerical simulations and use them to develop a sub-grid model of {BH} growth that can be incorporated into semi-analytic calculations or cosmological simulations. Motivated by both analytic calculations and simulations of gas inflow in galactic nuclei, we argue that the strongest torque on gas arises when non-axisymmetric perturbations to the stellar gravitational potential produce orbit crossings and shocks in the gas. This is true both at large radii ˜0.01-1 kpc, where bar-like stellar modes dominate the non-axisymmetric potential, and at smaller radii ≲10 pc, where a lopsided/eccentric stellar disc dominates. The traditional orbit-crossing criterion is not always adequate to predict the locations of, and inflow due to, shocks in gas+stellar discs with finite sound speeds. We derive a modified criterion that predicts the presence of shocks in stellar-dominated systems even absent formal orbit crossing. We then derive analytic expressions for the loss of angular momentum and the resulting gas inflow rates in the presence of such shocks. We test our analytic predictions using hydrodynamic simulations at a range of galactic scales, and show that they successfully predict the mass inflow rates and quasi-steady gas surface densities with a small scatter ≃0.3 dex. We use our analytic results to construct a new estimate of the {BH} accretion rate given galaxy properties at larger radii, for use in galaxy and cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. While highly simplified, this accretion rate predictor captures the key scalings in the numerical simulations. By contrast, alternate estimates such as the local viscous accretion rate or the spherical Bondi rate fail systematically to reproduce the simulations and have significantly larger scatter.},

	abstract = {Using a hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement code, we simulate the growth and evolution of a galaxy, which could potentially host a supermassive black hole, within a cosmological volume. Reaching a dynamical range in excess of 10 million, the simulation follows the evolution of the gas structure from super-galactic scales all the way down to the outer edge of the accretion disk. Here, we focus on global instabilities in the self-gravitating, cold, turbulence-supported, molecular gas disk at the center of the model galaxy, which provide a natural mechanism for angular momentum transport down to sub-pc scales. The gas density profile follows a power-law scaling as r{\textasciicircum}-8/3, consistent with an analytic description of turbulence in a quasi-stationary circumnuclear disk. We analyze the properties of the disk which contribute to the instabilities, and investigate the significance of instability for the galaxy's evolution and the growth of a supermassive black hole at the center.},

	abstract = {Observations of distant quasars indicate that supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses already existed less than a billion years after the Big Bang. Models in which the 'seeds' of such black holes form by the collapse of primordial metal-free stars cannot explain the rapid appearance of these supermassive black holes because gas accretion is not sufficiently efficient. Alternatively, these black holes may form by direct collapse of gas within isolated protogalaxies, but current models require idealized conditions, such as metal-free gas, to prevent cooling and star formation from consuming the gas reservoir. Here we report simulations showing that mergers between massive protogalaxies naturally produce the conditions for direct collapse into a supermassive black hole with no need to suppress cooling and star formation. Merger-driven gas inflows give rise to an unstable, massive nuclear gas disk of a few billion solar masses, which funnels more than 10(8) solar masses of gas to a sub-parsec-scale gas cloud in only 100,000 years. The cloud undergoes gravitational collapse, which eventually leads to the formation of a massive black hole. The black hole can subsequently grow to a billion solar masses on timescales of about 10(8) years by accreting gas from the surrounding disk.},

The simulations are designed to transport a large amount of magnetic flux to the center, more than the accreting gas can force into the {BH}. The excess magnetic flux remains outside the {BH}, impedes accretion, and leads to a magnetically arrested disc. We find powerful outflows. For a {BH} with spin parameter a = 0.5, the efficiency with which the accretion system generates outflowing energy in jets and winds is eta {\textasciitilde} 30\%. For a = 0.99, we find eta {\textasciitilde} 140\%, which means that more energy flows out of the {BH} than flows in. The only way this can happen is by extracting spin energy from the {BH}. Thus the a = 0.99 simulation represents an unambiguous demonstration, within an astrophysically plausible scenario, of the extraction of net energy from a spinning {BH} via the Penrose-Blandford-Znajek mechanism.

The simulations follow fueling over relatively quiescent phases of the galaxy's evolution (no mergers) and without feedback from active galactic nuclei ({AGNs}), as part of the first stage of using state-of-the-art, high-resolution cosmological simulations to model galaxy and black hole co-evolution. We present results from simulations at different redshifts (z = 6, 4, and 3) and three different black hole masses (3 × 10 7 , 9 × 10 7 , and 3 × 10 8 M ; at z = 4), as well as a simulation including a prescription that approximates optically thick cooling in the densest regions. The interior gas mass throughout the circumnuclear disk shows transient and chaotic behavior as a function of time. The Fourier transform of the interior gas mass follows a power law with slope −1 throughout the region, indicating that, in the absence of the effects of galaxy mergers and {AGN} feedback, mass fluctuations are stochastic with no preferred timescale for accretion over the duration of each simulation (∼1–2 Myr). The angular momentum of the gas disk changes direction relative to the disk on kiloparsec scales over timescales less than 1 Myr, reflecting the chaotic and transient gas dynamics of the circumnuclear region. Infalling clumps of gas, which are driven inward as a result of the dynamical state of the circumnuclear disk, may play an important role in determining the spin evolution of an {SMBH}, as has been suggested in stochastic accretion scenarios.},

The mock data products are produced by using stellar population synthesis models to assign spectral energy distributions ({SED}) to each star particle in the galaxies. The resulting synthetic images and integrated {SEDs} therefore properly reflect the spatial distribution, stellar metallicity distribution, and star formation history of the galaxies. From the synthetic data products it is possible to produce monochromatic or color-composite images, perform {SED} fitting, classify morphology, determine galaxy structural properties, and evaluate the impacts of galaxy viewing angle. The main contribution of this paper is to describe the production, format, and composition of the image catalog that makes up the Illustris Simulation Obsevatory. As a demonstration of this resource, we derive galactic stellar mass estimates by applying the {SED} fitting code {FAST} to the synthetic galaxy products, and compare the derived stellar masses against the true stellar masses from the simulation. We find from this idealized experiment that systematic biases exist in the photometrically derived stellar mass values that can be reduced by using a fixed metallicity in conjunction with a minimum galaxy age restriction.},

	abstract = {Active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) drive fast winds in the interstellar medium of their host galaxies. It is commonly assumed that the high ambient densities and intense radiation fields in galactic nuclei imply short cooling times, thus making the outflows momentum-conserving. We show that cooling of high-velocity, shocked winds in {AGN} is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances, including conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies ({ULIRGs}), resulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast energy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler gas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity v\_in{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10,000 km s{\textasciicircum}-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the shocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal pressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate directly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton cooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v\_in{\textasciitilde}1,000 km s{\textasciicircum}-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience energy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions. During the energy-conserving phase, the momentum flux of an outflow is boosted by a factor {\textasciitilde}v\_in/2v\_s by work done by the hot post-shock gas, where v\_s is the velocity of the swept-up material. Energy-conserving outflows driven by fast {AGN} winds (v\_in{\textasciitilde}0.1c) may therefore explain the momentum fluxes Pdot{\textgreater}{\textgreater}L\_AGN/c of galaxy-scale outflows recently measured in luminous quasars and {ULIRGs}. Shocked wind bubbles expanding normal to galactic disks may also explain the large-scale bipolar structures observed in some systems, including around the Galactic Center, and can produce significant radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission.

	abstract = {To study the effect of supermassive black holes ({SMBHs}) on their host galaxies it is important to study the hosts when the {SMBH} is near its peak activity. A method to investigate the host galaxies of high luminosity quasars is to obtain optical spectra at positions offset from the nucleus where the relative contribution of the quasar and host are comparable. However, at these extended radii the galaxy surface brightness is often low (20-22 mag per arcsec\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$) and the resulting spectrum might have such low S/N that it hinders analysis with standard stellar population modeling techniques. To address this problem we have developed a method that can recover galaxy star formation histories ({SFHs}) from rest frame optical spectra with S/N \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 5{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}{AA}\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. This method uses the statistical technique diffusion k-means to tailor the stellar population modeling basis set. Our diffusion k-means minimal basis set, composed of 4 broad age bins, is successful in recovering a range of galaxy {SFHs}. Additionally, using an analytic prescription for seeing conditions, we are able to simultaneously model scattered quasar light and the {SFH} of quasar host galaxies ({QHGs}). We use synthetic data to compare results of our novel method with previous techniques. We also present the modeling results on a previously published {QHG} and show that galaxy properties recovered from a diffusion k-means basis set are less sensitive to noise added to this quasar host galaxy spectrum. Our new method has a clear advantage in recovering information from {QHGs} and could also be applied to the analysis of other low S/N galaxy spectra such as those typically obtained for high redshift objects or integral field spectroscopic surveys.},

	abstract = {We study the properties of massive, galactic-scale outflows of molecular gas and investigate their impact on galaxy evolution. We present new {IRAM} {PdBI} {CO}(1-0) observations of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies ({ULIRGs}) and quasar-hosts: a clear signature of massive and energetic molecular outflows, extending on kpc scales, is found in the {CO}(1-0) kinematics of four out of seven sources, with measured outflow rates of several 100 M⊙ yr-1. We combine these new observations with data from the literature, and explore the nature and origin of massive molecular outflows within an extended sample of 19 local galaxies. We find that starburst-dominated galaxies have an outflow rate comparable to their star formation rate ({SFR}), or even higher by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2-4, implying that starbursts can indeed be effective in removing cold gas from galaxies. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the presence of an active galactic nucleus ({AGN}) can boost the outflow rate by a large factor, which is found to increase with the {LAGN}/Lbol ratio. The gas depletion time scales due to molecular outflows are anti-correlated with the presence and luminosity of an {AGN} in these galaxies, and range from a few hundred million years in starburst galaxies down to just a few million years in galaxies hosting powerful {AGNs}. In quasar hosts, the depletion time scales due to the outflow are much shorter than the depletion time scales due to star formation. We estimate the outflow kinetic power and find that, for galaxies hosting powerful {AGNs}, it corresponds to about 5\% of the {AGN} luminosity, as expected by models of {AGN} feedback. Moreover, we find that momentum rates of about 20 {LAGN}/c are common among the {AGN}-dominated sources in our sample. For "pure" starburst galaxies, our data tentatively support models in which outflows are mostly momentum-driven by the radiation pressure from young stars onto dusty clouds. Overall, our results indicate that, although starbursts are effective in powering massive molecular outflows, the presence of an {AGN} may strongly enhance such outflows, and therefore have a profound feedback effect on the evolution of galaxies by efficiently removing fuel for star formation, hence quenching star formation.

We describe a parameter study of galaxy formation simulations of an L* galaxy that uses early stellar feedback combined with supernova feedback to match the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. While supernova feedback alone can reduce star formation enough to match the stellar mass-halo mass relationship, the galaxy forms too many stars before z = 2 to match the evolution seen using abundance matching. Our early stellar feedback is purely thermal and thus operates like an ultraviolet ionization source as well as providing some additional pressure from the radiation of massive, young stars. The early feedback heats gas to \&gt;106 K before cooling it to 104 K. The pressure from this hot gas creates a more extended disc and prevents more star formation prior to z = 1 than supernova feedback alone. The resulting disc galaxy has a flat rotation curve, an exponential surface brightness profile, and matches a wide range of disc scaling relationships. The disc forms from the inside-out with an increasing exponential scale length as the galaxy evolves. Overall, early stellar feedback helps to simulate galaxies that match observational results at low and high redshifts.},

	abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's {EAGLE} project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and black holes in representative volumes. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and {AGN} in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the z{\textasciitilde}0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to \${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.2\$ dex over the full mass range, \$10{\textasciicircum}8 {\textless} M\_*/M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic {CIV} and {OVI}. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for \$M\_* {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. The gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for {AGN} feedback. {EAGLE} constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {{AGN} feedback is an important ingredient in galaxy evolution, however its treatment in numerical simulations is necessarily approximate, requiring subgrid prescriptions due to the dynamical range involved in the calculations. We present a suite of {SPH} simulations designed to showcase the importance of the choice of a particular subgrid prescription for {AGN} feedback. We concentrate on two approaches to treating wide-angle {AGN} outflows: thermal feedback, where thermal and kinetic energy is injected into the gas surrounding the {SMBH} particle, and virtual particle feedback, where energy is carried by tracer particles radially away from the {AGN}. We show that the latter model produces a far more complex structure around the {SMBH}, which we argue is a more physically correct outcome. We suggest a simple improvement to the thermal feedback model - injecting the energy into a cone, rather than spherically symmetrically - and show that this markedly improves the agreement between the two prescriptions, without requiring any noticeable increase in the computational cost of the simulation.},

Using lines of sight ({LOS}) targeted at impact parameters out to 1 Mpc around galaxies with a range of halo masses, we study the physical conditions and their variation with impact parameter b and line-of-sight velocity in the {CGM} as traced by {HI}, {MgII}, {SiIV}, {CIV}, {OVI}, and {NeVIII} absorbers. All ions show a strong excess of absorption near galaxies compared to random {LOS}. The excess continues beyond 1 Mpc, reflecting the correlation of metal absorption with large-scale structure. Absorption is particularly enhanced within {\textasciitilde} 300 km/s and 300 kpc of galaxies, roughly delineating the {CGM}; this range contains the majority of global metal absorption. The different behaviour of low ionisation potential species versus high ionisation potential species can be understood as low ionisation potential species tracing denser areas closer to galaxies, versus high ionisation potential species tracing more diffusely distributed gas. Photo-ionisation is the driver of this trend where lower ionisation potential species decline rapidly with increasing b while {OVI} and even weak {NeVIII} show comparatively flat radial dependencies. In addition, collisionally ionised {OVI} and strong {NeVIII} trace hot {CGM} gas when present in higher mass halos at b {\textbackslash}leq 100 kpc. Lower ionisation potential metals show little temperature dependence with b, while {OVI} and especially {NeVIII} trace hotter gas when present at lower b. Larger halo masses generally produce more absorption. These findings arise using our favored outflow scalings as expected for momentum-driven winds; with no winds, the {CGM} gas remains mostly unenriched, while outflows with constant velocity and mass loading factor show subtle differences.},

While previous studies emphasized the impact of feedback on dark matter profiles, we investigate the impact on the stellar component: kinematics, radial migration, size evolution, and population gradients. Feedback-driven outflows/inflows drive significant radial stellar migration over both short and long timescales via two processes: (1) outflowing/infalling gas can remain star-forming, producing young stars that migrate \${\textbackslash}sim1\{{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},kpc\}\$ within their first \$100 \{{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},Myr\}\$, and (2) gas outflows/inflows drive strong fluctuations in the global potential, transferring energy to all stars. These processes produce several dramatic effects. First, galaxies' effective radii can fluctuate by factors of \${\textgreater}2\$ over \${\textbackslash}sim200 \{{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},Myr\}\$, and these rapid size fluctuations can account for much of the observed scatter in radius at fixed \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm star\}.\$ Second, the cumulative effects of many outflow/infall episodes steadily heat stellar orbits, causing old stars to migrate outward most strongly. This age-dependent radial migration mixes---and even inverts---intrinsic age and metallicity gradients. Thus, the galactic-archaeology approach of calculating radial star-formation histories from stellar populations at \$z=0\$ can be severely biased. These effects are strongest at \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm star\}{\textbackslash}approx10{\textasciicircum}\{7-9.6\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$, the same regime where feedback most efficiently cores galaxies. Thus, detailed measurements of stellar kinematics in low-mass galaxies can strongly constrain feedback models and test baryonic solutions to small-scale problems in \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM}.},

If such life also makes observable changes to the galaxies they inhabit, then it is possible that vast domains of life-saturated galaxies could be visible from the Earth. Here, we describe the shape and angular size of these domains as viewed from the Earth, and calculate median visible sizes for a variety of scenarios. We also calculate the total fraction of the sky that should be covered by at least one domain. In each of the 27 scenarios we examine, the median angular size of the nearest domain is within an order of magnitude of a percent of the whole celestial sphere. Observing such a domain would likely require an analysis of galaxies on the order of a Gly from the Earth.},

I explore the connection between {LLSs} and their host halos and find that {LLSs} reside in halos with a wide range of halo masses with a nearly constant covering fraction within a virial radius. Over the range \$z=2-5\$, I find that more than half of the {LLSs} reside in halos with \$M {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, indicating that absorption line studies of {LLSs} can probe these low-mass galaxies which H\$\_2\$-based star formation models predict to have very little star formation. Improving on previous studies, the simulations in this work have a relatively high mass resolution of \$1.5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}5 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, allowing us to model the contribution of low-mass halos to {LLSs}. I study the physical state of individual {LLSs} and test a simple model which encapsulates many of their properties. I confirm that {LLSs} have a characteristic absorption length given by the Jeans length and that they are in photoionization equilibrium at low column densities. Finally, I investigate the self-shielding of {LLSs} to the {UVB} and explore how the non-sphericity of {LLSs} affects the photoionization rate at a given \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {HI}\}\$.

Selected spectral regions for each {QSO} have been observed at 35-80 km s-1 resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio so that the column densities of H I and associated ions of heavy elements might be determined. The H I column densities are in the range 17.0 ≤ log N(H I) ≤ 19.3. The column density measurements have been used in conjunction with photoionization models in order to estimate the physical parameters of the clouds or cloud ensembles responsible for the Lyman discontinuities. Although there are many uncertainties involved in the analysis, the heavy element abundances appear to be in the range -3.0 ≤ [M/H] ≤-1.5, and the relative abundances of C, 0, and Si, although uncertain, appear to be consistent with a uniform depletion relative to the solar values. If the results of the photoionization models are accurate, the particle density in the clouds is in the range 0.01 ≲ {nH} ≲ 0.1 and the corresponding cloud sizes and masses are inferred to be in the range 1 ≤ Dc ≤ 15 kpc and 106 ≤ Mc ≤ 109 Msun, respectively. Such parameters would be expected on theoretical grounds for clouds that condensed in extended (≳ 100 kpc) gaseous halos during the early evolution of normal galaxies. A considerable fraction of the inferred visible mass of present-day galaxies was probably in the form of these diffuse clouds at the epoch corresponding to z ≍ 3; thus, they have probably played an important role in the evolution of galaxies with time. The possibility that the heavy element absorbing clouds and the "Lyman-α forest" clouds have a common origin (but evolve differently because of their environment) is discussed.},

We then post-process the simulation data to compute the absorbing column density for a wide range of common atomic absorbers throughout the galactic halo, including H i, Mg ii, Si ii, Si iii, Si iv, C iv, N v, O vi and O vii. The radial profiles of these atomic column densities are compared against several quasar absorption line studies to determine if one feedback prescription is favoured. We find that although our models match some of the observations (specifically those ions with lower ionization strengths), it is particularly difficult to match O vi observations. There is some indication that the models with increased feedback intensity are better matches. We demonstrate that sufficient metals exist in these haloes to reproduce the observed column density distribution in principle, but the simulated {CGM} lacks significant multiphase substructure and is generally too hot. Furthermore, we demonstrate the failings of inflow-only models (without energetic feedback) at populating the {CGM} with adequate metals to match observations even in the presence of multiphase structure. Additionally, we briefly investigate the evolution of the {CGM} from z = 3 to present. Overall, we find that quasar absorption line observations of the gas around galaxies provide a new and important constraint on feedback models.},

	abstract = {We measure a relation between the depth of four prominent rest-{UV} absorption complexes and metallicity for local galaxies and verify it up to z{\textasciitilde}3. We then apply this relation to a sample of 224 galaxies at 3.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 6.0 ({\textless}z{\textgreater} = 4.8) in {COSMOS}, for which unique {UV} spectra from {DEIMOS} and accurate stellar masses from {SPLASH} are available. The average galaxy population at z{\textasciitilde}5 and log(M/Msun) {\textgreater} 9 is characterized by 0.3-0.4 dex (in units of 12+log(O/H)) lower metallicities than at z{\textasciitilde}2, but comparable to z{\textasciitilde}3.5. We find galaxies with weak/no Ly-alpha emission to have metallicities comparable to z{\textasciitilde}2 galaxies and therefore may represent an evolved sub-population of z{\textasciitilde}5 galaxies. We find a correlation between metallicity and dust in good agreement with local galaxies and an inverse trend between metallicity and star-formation rate ({SFR}) consistent with observations at z{\textasciitilde}2. The relation between stellar mass and metallicity ({MZ} relation) is similar to z{\textasciitilde}3.5, however, there are indications of it being slightly shallower, in particular for the young, Ly-alpha emitting galaxies. We show that, within a "bathtub" approach, a shallower {MZ} relation is expected in the case of a fast (exponential) build-up of stellar mass with an e-folding time of 100-200 Myr. Due to this fast evolution, the process of dust production and metal enrichment as a function of mass could be more stochastic in the first billion years of galaxy formation compared to later times.},

	abstract = {Vacuum bubbles may nucleate and expand during the inflationary epoch in the early universe. After inflation ends, the bubbles quickly dissipate their kinetic energy; they come to rest with respect to the Hubble flow and eventually form black holes. The fate of the bubble itself depends on the resulting black hole mass. If the mass is smaller than a certain critical value, the bubble collapses to a singularity. Otherwise, the bubble interior inflates, forming a baby universe, which is connected to the exterior {FRW} region by a wormhole. A similar black hole formation mechanism operates for spherical domain walls nucleating during inflation. As an illustrative example, we studied the black hole mass spectrum in the domain wall scenario, assuming that domain walls interact with matter only gravitationally. Our results indicate that, depending on the model parameters, black holes produced in this scenario can have significant astrophysical effects and can even serve as dark matter or as seeds for supermassive black holes. The mechanism of black hole formation described in this paper is very generic and has important implications for the global structure of the universe. Baby universes inside super-critical black holes inflate eternally and nucleate bubbles of all vacua allowed by the underlying particle physics. The resulting multiverse has a very non-trivial spacetime structure, with a multitude of eternally inflating regions connected by wormholes.},

An emphasis is placed upon the temporal history of chemical enrichment during its passage through the corona and {CGM}. We derive the distributions of time between gas crossing the virial radius and being accreted to the star forming region (which allows mixing within the corona), as well as the time between gas being accreted to the star forming region and then forming stars (which allows mixing within the disc). Significant numbers of stars are formed from gas that cycles back through the hot halo after first accreting to the star forming region. Gas entering high mass galaxies is pre-enriched in low mass proto-galaxies prior to entering the virial radius of the central progenitor, with only small amounts of primordial gas accreted, even at high redshift (z{\textasciitilde}5). After entering the virial radius, significant further enrichment occurs prior to the accretion of the gas to the star forming region, with gas that is feeding the star forming region surpassing 0.1Z by z=0. Mixing with halo gas, itself enriched via galactic fountains, is thus crucial in determining the metallicity at which gas is accreted to the disc. The lowest mass simulation (Mvir{\textasciitilde}2x10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}Msun, with M*{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}7Msun), by contrast, accretes primordial gas through the virial radius and onto the disc at all times. Much like the classical analytical solutions to the `G-dwarf problem', overproduction of low-metallicity stars is ameliorated by the inefficiency of star formation. Finally, gas outflow/metal removal rates from star forming regions as a function of galactic mass are presented.},

For the first time, our simulations agree reasonably well with the observed mass-metallicity relations at z=0-3 for a broad range of galaxy masses. We predict the evolution of the {MZR} from z=0-6 as log(Zgas/Zsun)=12+log(O/H)-9.0=0.35[log(Mstar/Msun)-10]+0.93 exp(-0.43 z)-1.05 and log(Zstar/Zsun)=[Fe/H]-0.2=0.40[log(Mstar/Msun)-10]+0.67 exp(-0.50 z)-1.04, for gas-phase and stellar metallicity, respectively. Our simulations suggest that the evolution of {MZR} is associated with the evolution of stellar/gas mass fractions at different redshifts, indicating the existence of a universal metallicity relation between stellar mass, gas mass, and metallicities. In our simulations, galaxies above Mstar=10{\textasciicircum}6 Msun are able to retain a large fraction of their metals inside the halo, because metal-rich winds fail to escape completely and are recycled into the galaxy. This resolves a long-standing discrepancy between "sub-grid" wind models (and semi-analytic models) and observations, where common sub-grid models cannot simultaneously reproduce the {MZR} and the stellar mass functions.},

	abstract = {Simulations predict that galaxies grow primarily through the accretion of gas that has not gone through an accretion shock near the virial radius and that this cold gas flows towards the central galaxy along dense filaments and streams. There is, however, little observational evidence for the existence of these cold flows. We use a large, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation that has been post-processed with radiative transfer to study the contribution of cold flows to the observed z= 3 column density distribution of neutral hydrogen, which our simulation reproduces. We find that nearly all of the H I absorption arises in gas that has remained colder than 105.5 K, at least while it was extragalactic. In addition, the majority of the H I is falling rapidly towards a nearby galaxy, with non-negligible contributions from outflowing and static gas. Above a column density of ? cm-2, most of the absorbers reside inside haloes, but the interstellar medium only dominates for ? cm-2. Haloes with total mass below 1010 M\&sun; dominate the absorption for ? cm-2, but the average halo mass increases sharply for higher column densities. Although very little of the H I in absorbers with ? cm-2 resides inside galaxies, systems with ? cm-2 are closely related to star formation: most of their H I either will become part of the interstellar medium before z= 2 or has been ejected from a galaxy at z {\textgreater} 3. Cold accretion flows are critical for the success of our simulation in reproducing the observed rate of incidence of damped Lyman-α and particularly that of Lyman limit systems. We therefore conclude that cold accretion flows exist and have already been detected in the form of high column density H I absorbers.},

	abstract = {We present a two-zone theory for feedback-regulated star formation in galactic discs, consistently connecting the galaxy-averaged star formation law with star formation proceeding in giant molecular clouds ({GMCs}). Our focus is on galaxies with gas surface density Σg ≳ 100 M⊙ pc-2, where the interstellar medium ({ISM}) can be assumed to be fully molecular. This regime includes most star formation in the Universe and our basic framework can be extended to other galaxies. In our theory, the galactic disc consists of Toomre-mass {GMCs} embedded in a volume-filling {ISM}. Radiation pressure on dust disperses {GMCs} and most supernovae explode in the volume-filling medium. A galaxy-averaged star formation law is derived by balancing the momentum input from supernova feedback with the vertical gravitational weight of the disc gas. This star formation law is in good agreement with observations for a {CO} conversion factor depending continuously on Σg. We argue that the galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency per free-fall time, ɛ \_ff{\textasciicircum}gal, is only a weak function of the efficiency with which {GMCs} convert their gas into stars, ɛ \_int{\textasciicircum}{GMC}. This is possible because the rate limiting step for star formation is the rate at which {GMCs} form: for large efficiency of star formation in {GMCs}, the Toomre Q parameter obtains a value slightly above unity so that the {GMC} formation rate is consistent with the galaxy-averaged star formation law. We contrast our results with other theories of turbulence-regulated star formation and discuss predictions of our model. Using a compilation of data from the literature, we show that the galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency per free-fall time is non-universal and increases with increasing gas fraction, as predicted by our model. We also predict that the fraction of the disc gas mass in bound {GMCs} decreases for increasing values of the {GMC} star formation efficiency. This is qualitatively consistent with the smooth molecular gas distribution inferred in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies and the small mass fraction in giant clumps in high-redshift galaxies.},

Each universe within a possibly huge multiverse might be slightly or even very different from the others. The quilted multiverse is one of these types, whose uniqueness arises from the postulate that every possible event will occur infinitely many times in infinitely many universes. In this paper we show that the quilted multiverse is not self-consistent due to the instability of entropy decrease under small perturbations. We therefore propose a modified version of the quilted multiverse which might overcome this shortcoming. It includes only those universes where the minimal entropy occurs at the same instant of (cosmological) time.},

In this paper, we present a tree-based classifier: Attention Tree ({ATree}) for large-scale image classification that uses recursive Adaboost training to construct a visual attention hierarchy. The proposed attention model is inspired from the biological 'selective tuning mechanism for cortical visual processing'. We exploit the inherent feature similarity across images in datasets to identify the input variability and use recursive optimization procedure, to determine data partitioning at each node, thereby, learning the attention hierarchy. A set of binary classifiers is organized on top of the learnt hierarchy to minimize the overall test-time complexity. The attention model maximizes the margins for the binary classifiers for optimal decision boundary modelling, leading to better performance at minimal complexity. The proposed framework has been evaluated on both Caltech-256 and {SUN} datasets and achieves accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art tree-based methods at significantly lower computational cost.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05112},
	abstract = {We present the catalogue of the Mg {II} absorption systems detected at a high significance level using an automated search algorithm in the spectra of quasars from the twelfth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A total of 266,433 background quasars were searched for the presence of absorption systems in their spectra. The continuum modelling for the quasar spectra was performed using a mean filter. A pseudo-continuum derived using a median filter was used to trace the emission lines. The absorption system catalogue contains 39,694 Mg {II} systems detected at a 6.0, 3.0\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ level respectively for the two lines of the doublet. The catalogue was constrained to an absorption line redshift of 0.35 \${\textbackslash}le\$ z\$\_\{2796\}\$ \${\textbackslash}le\$ 2.3. The rest-frame equivalent width of the \${\textbackslash}lambda\$2796 line ranges between 0.2 \${\textbackslash}le\$ W\$\_r\$ \${\textbackslash}le\$ 6.2 {\textbackslash}{AA}. Using Gaussian-noise only simulations we estimate a false positive rate of 7.7 per cent in the catalogue. We measured the number density \${\textbackslash}partial N{\textasciicircum}\{2796\}/{\textbackslash}partial z\$ of Mg {II} absorbers and find evidence for steeper evolution of the systems with W\$\_r {\textbackslash}ge\$ 1.2 {\textbackslash}{AA}{\textbackslash} at low redshifts (z\$\_\{2796\}\$ \${\textbackslash}le\$ 1.0), consistent with other earlier studies. A suite of null tests over the redshift range 0.5 \${\textbackslash}le\$ z\$\_\{2796\}\$ \${\textbackslash}le\$ 1.5 was used to study the presence of systematics and selection effects like the dependence of the number density evolution of the absorption systems on the properties of the background quasar spectra. The null tests do not indicate the presence of any selection effects in the absorption catalogue if the quasars with spectral signal-to-noise level less than 5.0 are removed. The resultant catalogue contains 36,981 absorption systems. The Mg {II} absorption catalogue is publicly available.},

Using a dozen quasars passing near spectroscopically identified galaxies at z ˜ 0.1, we find that the azimuthal orientation of the quasar sightlines with strong Mg {II} absorption (with Wrλ2796 {\textgreater} 0.3Å) is bi-modal: about half the Mg {II} sightlines are aligned with the major axis and the other half are within α = 30° of the minor axis, suggesting that bipolar outflows can contribute to the Mg {II} cross-section. This bi-modality is also present in the instantaneous star formation rates ({SFRs}) of the hosts. For the sightlines aligned along the minor axis, a simple bi-conical wind model is indeed able to reproduce the observed Mg {II} kinematics and the Mg {II} dependence with impact parameter b, (Wrλ2796 ∝ b-1). Using our wind model, we can directly extract key wind properties such as the de-projected outflow speed Vout of the cool material traced by Mg {II} and the outflow rates M⊙ out . The outflow speeds Vout are found to be 150-300 km s-1, i.e. of the order of the circular velocity, and smaller than the escape velocity by a factor of ˜2. The outflow rates M⊙ out are typically two to three times the instantaneous {SFRs}. Our results demonstrate how background quasars can be used to measure wind properties with high precision.},

	abstract = {We study the structure, age and metallicity gradients, and dynamical evolution using a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project. In the simulation, stars older than 6 Gyr were formed in a chaotic, bursty mode and have the largest vertical scale heights (1.5-2.5 kpc) by z=0, while stars younger than 6 Gyr were formed in a relatively calm, stable disk. The vertical scale height increases with stellar age at all radii, because (1) stars that formed earlier were thicker "at birth", and (2) stars were kinematically heated to an even thicker distribution after formation. Stars of the same age are thicker in the outer disk than in the inner disk (flaring). These lead to positive vertical age gradients and negative radial age gradients. The radial metallicity gradient is neg- ative at the mid-plane, flattens at larger disk height {\textbar}Z{\textbar}, and turns positive above {\textbar}Z{\textbar}{\textasciitilde}1.5kpc. The vertical metallicity gradient is negative at all radii, but is steeper at smaller radii. These trends broadly agree with observations in the Milky Way and can be naturally understood from the age gradients. The vertical stellar density profile can be well-described by two components, with scale heights 200-500 pc and 1-1.5 kpc, respectively. The thick component is a mix of stars older than 4 Gyr which formed through a combination of several mechanisms. Our results also demonstrate that it is possible to form a thin disk in cosmological simulations even with strong stellar feedback.},

If the galaxies are young and contain a lot of gas, the collision may kick all the gas off the systems and thus strongly suppress any farther star formation. As a result, the galaxies now have a very low surface brightness and other properties typical of the ultra diffuse galaxies. We use the Coma cluster (where numerous {UDGs} were recently discovered) to test the efficiency of the process. The mechanism works very well and can transform a significant fraction of the cluster population into ultra diffuse galaxies. The {UDGs} formed by the process concentrate towards the center of the cluster, and their globular cluster systems remain undamaged, in accordance with observational results. The projected density of {UDGs} on the cluster images may help us to recognize the mechanism of the {UDG} formation that realizes in reality.},

Each code implements a distinct set of feedback and star formation prescriptions. We find that while many galaxy and halo properties vary between the different codes (and feedback prescriptions), there is qualitative agreement on the process of angular momentum acquisition in the galaxy's halo. In all simulations, cold filamentary gas accretion to the halo results in {\textasciitilde}4 times more specific angular momentum in cold halo gas (\${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{cold\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.1\$) than in the dark matter halo. At z{\textgreater}1, this inflow takes the form of inspiraling cold streams that are co-directional in the halo of the galaxy and are fueled, aligned, and kinematically connected to filamentary gas infall along the cosmic web. Due to the qualitative agreement among disparate simulations, we conclude that the buildup of high angular momentum halo gas and the presence of these inspiraling cold streams are robust predictions of Lambda Cold Dark Matter galaxy formation, though the detailed morphology of these streams is significantly less certain. A growing body of observational evidence suggests that this process is borne out in the real universe.},

By cross-correlating about 50,000 {MgII} absorbers with millions of sources from the {SDSS} (optical), {WISE} ({IR}), and {GALEX} ({UV}) surveys we effectively extract about 2,000 galaxy-absorber pairs at z{\textasciitilde}0.5 and probe relations between absorption strength and galaxy type, impact parameter and azimuthal angle. We find that cool gas traced by {MgII} absorbers exists around both star-forming and passive galaxies with a similar incidence rate on scales greater than 100 kpc but each galaxy type exhibits a different behavior on smaller scales: {MgII} equivalent width does not correlate with the presence of passive galaxies whereas stronger {MgII} absorbers tend to be found in the vicinity of star-forming galaxies. This effect is preferentially seen along the minor axis of these galaxies, suggesting that some of the gas is associated with outflowing material. In contrast, the distribution of cool gas around passive galaxies is consistent with being isotropic on the same scales. We quantify the average excess {MgII} equivalent width \${\textless}{\textbackslash}delta W\_\{0\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm {MgII}\}{\textgreater}\$ as a function of galaxy properties and find \${\textless}{\textbackslash}delta W\_0{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm {MgII}\}{\textgreater}{\textbackslash}propto {SFR}{\textasciicircum}\{1.2\}, {sSFR}{\textasciicircum}\{0.5\}\$ and \$M\_{\textbackslash}ast{\textasciicircum}\{0.4\}\$ for star-forming galaxies. This work demonstrates that the dichotomy between star-forming and passive galaxies is reflected in the {CGM} traced by low-ionized gas. We also measure the covering fraction of {MgII} absorption and find it to be about 2-10 times higher for star-forming galaxies than passive ones within 50 kpc.

In particular, local sources of ionizing radiation, overabundance of oxygen, departures from ionization equilibrium, and collisional ionization would all imply more compact clouds. The clouds are too small to be self-gravitating and pressure confinement is only consistent under special conditions. We argue that the clouds are, in any case, likely to be short-lived and we demonstrate that this implies that the clouds could easily have been responsible for the transport of all metals that end up in the intergalactic medium ({IGM}). When the clouds reach pressure equilibrium with the general, photo-ionized {IGM}, the metals will still be concentrated in small high-metallicity patches, but they will look like ordinary, low-metallicity absorbers. We conclude that intergalactic metals are poorly mixed on small scales and that nearly all of the {IGM}, and thus the universe, may therefore be of primordial composition.},

We focus on the morphology and kinematics of the neutral hydrogen and how this depends on f\_g, the ratio of gas-to-stellar mass within the optical radius. In gas-rich galaxies with f\_g {\textgreater} 0.1, gas temperatures rise slowly from center of the halo out to the virial radius and average neutral gas column densities remain above 10{\textasciicircum}19 atoms cm{\textasciicircum}-2 out to radii of 50-70 kpc. In gas-poor galaxies with f\_g {\textless} 0.1, gas temperatures rise quickly outside the edge of the disk to 10{\textasciicircum}6 K, and then remain fixed out to radii of 100 kpc. The column density of neutral gas quickly drops below 10{\textasciicircum}19 atoms cm{\textasciicircum}-2 at radii of 10 kpc. Neutral gas distributions are also more asymmetric in gas-poor galaxies. Most of the differences between gas-poor and gas-rich galaxies in the Illustris simulation can be attributed to the effects of "radio-mode" {AGN} feedback. In the Illustris simulation, the circumgalactic gas is found to rotate coherently about the center of the galaxy with a maximum rotational velocity of around 200 km/s. In gas-rich galaxies, the average coherence length of the rotating gas is 40 kpc, compared to 10 kpc in gas-poor galaxies. In the very most gas-rich systems, the {CGM} can rotate coherently over scales of 70-100 kpc.

We attribute this to the inclusion of {AGN} feedback, which changes the gas distribution so as to mimic the effect of extra photons, as well as the use of the Faucher-Giguere (2009) ultra-violet background, which is more ionizing at z=0.1 than the Haardt \& Madau (2012) background previously considered. We show that the difference between simulations run with smoothed particle hydrodynamics and simulations using a moving mesh is small in this column density range. We further consider the effect of supernova feedback, Voigt profile fitting and finite resolution, all of which we show to be small. Finally, we identify a discrepancy between our simulations and observations at column densities 10{\textasciicircum}14-10{\textasciicircum}16 cm{\textasciicircum}-2, where Illustris produces too few absorbers, which suggests the {AGN} feedback model in cosmological simulations should be further refined.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03244},
	abstract = {We present a new implementation of star formation in cosmological simulations, by considering star clusters as a unit of star formation. Cluster particles grow in mass over several million years at the rate determined by local gas properties, with high time resolution. The particle growth is terminated by its own energy and momentum feedback on the interstellar medium. We test this implementation for Milky Way-sized galaxies at high redshift, by comparing the properties of model clusters with observations of young star clusters. We find that the cluster initial mass function is best described by a Schechter function rather than a single power law. In agreement with observations, at low masses the logarithmic slope is \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}approx 1.8-2\$, while the cutoff at high mass scales with the star formation rate. A related trend is a positive correlation between the surface density of star formation rate and fraction of stars contained in massive clusters. Both trends indicate that the formation of massive star clusters is preferred during bursts of star formation. These bursts are often associated with major merger events. We also find that the median timescale for cluster formation ranges from 0.5 to 4 Myr and decreases systematically with increasing star formation efficiency. Local variations in the gas density and cluster accretion rate naturally lead to the scatter of the overall formation efficiency by an order of magnitude, even when the instantaneous efficiency is kept constant. Comparison of the formation timescale with the observed age spread of young star clusters provides an additional important constraint on the modeling of star formation and feedback schemes.},

Approximately 41\%, 9\%, and 50\% of all gas-phase metals at z = 3 are locked in a hot (T {\textgreater} 3 × 105 K), warm (3 × 105 K {\textgreater} T {\textgreater} 3 × 104 K), and cold (T {\textless} 3 × 104 K) medium, respectively. We identify three sources of heavy elements: (1) the main host, responsible for 60\% of all the metals found within 3 R vir; (2) its satellite progenitors, which shed their metals before and during infall, and are responsible for 28\% of all the metals within 3 R vir, and for only 5\% of those beyond 3 R vir; and (3) nearby dwarfs, which give origin to 12\% of all the metals within 3 R vir and 95\% of those beyond 3 R vir. Late (z {\textless} 5) galactic "superwinds"—the result of recent star formation in {ErisMC}—account for only 9\% of all the metals observed beyond 2 R vir, the bulk having been released at redshifts 5 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 8 by early star formation and outflows. In the {CGM}, lower overdensities are typically enriched by "older," colder metals. Heavy elements are accreted onto {ErisMC} along filaments via low-metallicity cold inflows and are ejected hot via galactic outflows at a few hundred km s-1. The outflow mass-loading factor is of order unity for the main halo, but can exceed a value of 10 for nearby dwarfs. We stress that our "zoom-in" simulation focuses on the {CGM} of a single massive system and cannot describe the enrichment history of the intergalactic medium as a whole by a population of galaxies with different masses and star formation histories.},

We investigate the variation of Mg {II} rest-frame equivalent width ({EW}) as a function of the radial impact parameter for different subsets of foreground galaxies selected in terms of their rest-frame colors and masses. Blue galaxies have a significantly higher average Mg {II} {EW} at close galactocentric radii as compared to the red galaxies. Among the blue galaxies, there is a correlation between Mg {II} {EW} and galactic stellar mass of the host galaxy. We also find that the distribution of Mg {II} absorption around group galaxies is more extended than that for non-group galaxies, and that groups as a whole have more extended radial profiles than individual galaxies. Interestingly, these effects can be satisfactorily modeled by a simple superposition of the absorption profiles of individual member galaxies, assuming that these are the same as those of non-group galaxies, suggesting that the group environment may not significantly enhance or diminish the Mg {II} absorption of individual galaxies. We show that there is a strong azimuthal dependence of the Mg {II} absorption within 50 kpc of inclined disk-dominated galaxies, indicating the presence of a strongly bipolar outflow aligned along the disk rotation axis. There is no significant dependence of Mg {II} absorption on the apparent inclination angle of disk-dominated galaxies.

	abstract = {We present predictions of Lyα forest-galaxy correlations at z=3 from Eulerian simulations that include the effects of galactic winds, driven primarily by supernova explosions. Galactic winds produce expanding bubbles of shock-heated gas within {\textasciitilde}0.5 comoving h-1 Mpc of luminous galaxies in the simulation, which have space density similar to that of observed Lyman break galaxies ({LBGs}). However, most of the low-density intergalactic gas that determines the observed properties of the Lyα forest is unaffected by winds. The impact of winds on the Lyα optical depth near galaxies is less dramatic than their impact on gas temperature, because winds heat only a small fraction of the gas present in the turnaround regions surrounding galaxies. Hence, Lyα absorption from gas outside the wind bubbles is spread out over the same velocity range occupied by the wind-heated gas. In general, Lyα absorption is expected to be stronger than average near galaxies because of the high gas density. Winds result in a modest reduction of this expected increase of Lyα absorption. Our predictions can be compared to future observations to detect the wind effects and infer their strength, although with the caveat that the results are still dependent on the correspondence of simulated galaxies and observed {LBGs}. We find that wind effects in our simulations are not strong enough to reproduce the high Lyα transmission within 0.5 h-1 Mpc comoving of galaxies that has been suggested by recent observations; powerful galactic explosions or ejecta with hyper-escape velocities would be required, but these are unlikely to be produced by ordinary star formation and supernovae alone.},

	abstract = {To investigate the differences in mechanical feedback from radio-loud and radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei ({AGN}) on the host galaxy, we perform 3D {AMR} hydrodynamic simulations of wide angle, radio-quiet winds with different inclinations on a single, massive, gas-rich disk galaxy at a redshift of 2-3. We compare our results to hydrodynamic simulations of the same galaxy but with a jet. The jet has an inclination of 0 degrees (perpendicular to the galactic plane), and the winds have inclinations of 0, 45, and 90 degrees. We analyze the impact on the host's gas, star formation, and circum-galactic medium. We find that jet feedback is energy-driven and wind feedback is momentum-driven. In all the simulations, the jet or wind creates a cavity mostly devoid of dense gas in the nuclear region where star formation is then quenched, but we find strong positive feedback in all the simulations at radii greater than 3 kpc. All four simulations have similar {SFRs} and stellar velocities with large radial and vertical components. However, the wind at an inclination of 90 degrees creates the highest density regions through ram pressure and generates the highest rates of star formation due to its ongoing strong interaction with the dense gas of the galactic plane. With increased wind inclination, we find greater asymmetry in gas distribution and resulting star formation. Our model generates an expanding ring of triggered star formation with typical velocity of order 1/3 of the circular velocity, superimposed on the older stellar population. This should result in a potentially detectable blue asymmetry in stellar absorption features at kpc scales.},

Analysis of our Keck spectra together with measurements derived from associated {HST} images reveals increasingly larger stellar velocity dispersions and smaller sizes to redshifts beyond z{\textasciitilde}2. By classifying our sample according to Sersic indices, we find that among disk-like systems the flatter ones show a higher dynamical to stellar mass ratio compared to their rounder counterparts which we interpret as evidence for a significant contribution of rotational motion. For this subset of disk-like systems, we estimate that V/sigma, the ratio of the circular velocity to the intrinsic velocity dispersion, is a factor of two larger than for present-day disky quiescent galaxies. Although this ratio between dynamical and stellar mass is roughly constant with redshift for the total quiescent population, we see a redshift evolution for the subset of spheroidal systems. By matching galaxies at fixed velocity dispersion, we are able to connect descendants with their earlier progenitors thereby determining the growth in size for quiescent galaxies over two distinct redshift ranges for the first time. We measure a size growth rate of 0.13 dex/Gyr over 1.3 {\textless} z {\textless} 2 which contrasts with a rate of only 0.03 dex/Gyr over 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.3.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00007},
	abstract = {The neutral hydrogen ({HI}) content of dark matter haloes forms an intermediate state in the baryon cycle that connects the hot shock-heated gas and cold star-forming gas in haloes. Measurement of the relationship between {HI} mass and halo mass therefore puts important constraints on galaxy formation models. We combine radio observations of {HI} in emission at low redshift (\$z{\textbackslash}sim 0\$) with optical/{UV} observations of {HI} in absorption at high redshift (\$1{\textless}z{\textless}4\$) to derive constraints on the evolution of the {HI}-mass halo-mass ({HIHM}) relation from redshift \$z=4\$ to \$z=0\$. We model the evolution of the {HIHM} relation in a manner similar to that of the stellar-halo mass ({SHM}) relation. Combining this parameterisation with a redshift- and mass-dependent modified Navarro-Frenk-White ({NFW}) profile for the {HI} density within a halo, we draw constraints on the evolution of the {HIHM} relation from the observed {HI} column density, incidence rate, and clustering bias at high redshift. We find that the peak {HI} mass fraction moderately increases from 1\% at \$z=0\$ to about 3.1\% at \$z=4\$. The corresponding halo mass increases from \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11.7\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12.4\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. The data do not suggest a strong evolution in the {HI} density profile. Predictions of this model are in excellent agreement with the observed column density distribution and incidence rate of high-column-density {HI} absorption-line systems at high redshift, although the agreement is poor with the column density distribution at \$z=0\$. The increase in the halo mass with maximum {HI} mass fraction also enables the model predictions to successfully match the measured clustering bias of high column density {HI} systems at \$z=2.3\$. We discuss the resultant evolution of the {HIHM} relation and its consequences for {HI} and galaxy evolution. [Abridged Abstract]},

	abstract = {We study the formation of galaxies in a large volume (50 h-1 Mpc, 2 x 2883 particles) cosmological simulation, evolved using the entropy and energy-conserving smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) code {GADGET}-2. Most of the baryonic mass in galaxies of all masses is originally acquired through filamentary cold mode' accretion of gas that was never shock heated to its halo virial temperature, confirming the key feature of our earlier results obtained with a different {SPH} code. Atmospheres of hot, virialized gas develop in haloes above 2-3 x 1011 M\{odot\}, a transition mass that is nearly constant from z= 3 to 0. Cold accretion persists in haloes above the transition mass, especially at z[\&ge;] 2. It dominates the growth of galaxies in low-mass haloes at all times, and it is the main driver of the cosmic star formation history. Our results suggest that the cooling of shock-heated virialized gas, which has been the focus of many analytic models of galaxy growth spanning more than three decades, might be a relatively minor element of galaxy formation. At high redshifts, satellite galaxies have gas accretion rates similar to central galaxies of the same baryonic mass, but at z {\textless} 1 the accretion rates of low-mass satellites are well below those of comparable central galaxies. Relative to our earlier simulations, the {GADGET}-2 simulations predict much lower rates of hot mode' accretion from the virialized gas component. Hot accretion rates compete with cold accretion rates near the transition mass, but only at z[\&le;] 1. Hot accretion is inefficient in haloes above [{\textasciitilde}]5 x 1012 M\{odot\}, with typical rates lower than 1 M\{odot\} yr-1 at z[\&le;] 1, even though our simulation does not include active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) heating or other forms of preventive' feedback. Instead, the accretion rates are low because the inner density profiles of hot gas in these haloes are shallow, with long associated cooling times. The cooling recipes typically used in semi-analytic models can overestimate the accretion rates in these haloes by orders of magnitude, so these models may overemphasize the role of preventive feedback in producing observed galaxy masses and colours. A fraction of the massive haloes develop cuspy profiles and significant cooling rates between z= 1 and 0, a redshift trend similar to the observed trend in the frequency of cooling flow clusters.},

	title = {How to quench a galaxy},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02507},
	abstract = {We show how the interplay between active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) and merger history determines whether a galaxy quenches star formation at high redshift. We first simulate, in a full cosmological context, a galaxy of total dynamical mass \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at \$z=2\$. Then we systematically alter the accretion history of the galaxy by minimally changing the linear overdensity in the initial conditions. This "genetic modification" approach allows the generation of three sets of \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} initial conditions leading to maximum merger ratios of 1:10, 1:5 and 2:3 respectively. The changes leave the final halo mass, large scale structure and local environment unchanged, providing a controlled numerical experiment. Interaction between the {AGN} physics and mergers in the three cases lead respectively to a star-forming, temporarily-quenched and permanently-quenched galaxy. However the differences do not primarily lie in the black hole accretion rates, but in the kinetic effects of the merger: the galaxy is resilient against {AGN} feedback unless its gaseous disk is first disrupted. Typical accretion rates are comparable in the three cases, falling below \$0.1{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, equivalent to around \$2{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the Eddington rate or \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ times the pre-quenching star formation rate, in agreement with observations. This low level of black hole accretion can be sustained even when there is insufficient dense cold gas for star formation. Conversely, supernova feedback is too distributed to generate outflows in high-mass systems, and cannot maintain quenching over periods longer than the halo gas cooling time.},

	abstract = {To investigate galaxy properties as a function of their total stellar mass, we obtained 21cm {HI} line observations at the 100-m class Nan{\textbackslash}c\{c\}ay Radio Telescope of 2839 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS}) in the Local Volume (900{\textless}cz{\textless}12,000 km/s), dubbed the Nan{\textbackslash}c\{c\}ay Interstellar Baryons Legacy Extragalactic Survey ({NIBLES}) sample. They were selected evenly over their entire range of absolute {SDSS} z-band magnitudes (-13.5 to -24 mag), which were used as a proxy for their stellar masses. Here, a first, global presentation of the observations and basic results is given, their further analysis will be presented in other papers in this series. The galaxies were selected based on their properties, as listed in {SDSS} {DR}5. Comparing this photometry to their total {HI} masses, we noted that, for a few percent, the {SDSS} magnitudes appeared severely misunderestimated, as confirmed by our re-measurements for selected objects. Although using the later {DR}9 results eliminated this problem in most cases, 384 still required manual photometric source selection. Usable {HI} spectra were obtained for 2600 galaxies, of which 1733 (67\%) were clearly detected and 174 (7\%) marginally. The spectra for 241 other observed galaxies could not be used for further analysis owing to problems with either the {HI} or the {SDSS} data. We reached the target number of about 150 sources per half-magnitude bin over the Mz range -16.5 to -23 mag. Down to -21 mag the overall detection rate is rather constant at the {\textasciitilde}75\% level but it starts to decline steadily towards the 30\% level at -23 mag. Making regression fits by comparing total {HI} and stellar masses for our sample, including our conservatively estimated {HI} upper limits for non-detections, we find the relationship log(M\_HI/M*) = -0.59 log(M*) + 5.05, which lies significantly below the relationship found in the M\_HI/M* - M* plane when only using {HI} detections.},

	abstract = {Gamma-ray Bursts ({GRBs}) are the most powerful explosions known, capable of outshining the rest of gamma-ray sky during their short-lived prompt emission. Their cosmological nature makes them the best tool to explore the final stages in the lives of very massive stars up to the highest redshifts. Furthermore, studying the emission from their low-energy counterparts (optical and infrared) via rapid spectroscopy, we have been able to pin down the exact location of the most distant galaxies as well as placing stringent constraints on their host galaxies and intervening systems at low and high-redshift (e.g. metallicity and neutral hydrogen fraction). In fact, each {GRB} spectrum contains absorption features imprinted by metals in the host interstellar medium ({ISM}) as well as the intervening intergalactic medium ({IGM}) along the line of sight. In this chapter we summarize the progress made using a large dataset of {GRB} spectra in understanding the nature of both these absorbers and how {GRBs} can be used to study the early Universe, in particular to measure the neutral hydrogen fraction and the escape fraction of {UV} photons before and during the epoch of re-ionization.},

	abstract = {We report interferometric measurements of [{NII}] 205 um fine-structure line emission from a representative sample of three galaxies at z=5-6 using the Atacama Large (sub)Millimeter Array ({ALMA}). These galaxies were previously detected in [{CII}] and far-infrared continuum emission and span almost two orders of magnitude in star formation rate ({SFR}). Our results show at least two different regimes of ionized inter-stellar medium properties for galaxies in the first billion years of cosmic time, separated by their L\_[{CII}]/L\_[{NII}] ratio. We find extremely low [{NII}] emission compared to [{CII}] (L\_ [{CII}]/L\_[{NII}]=68 [+200/-28]) from a "typical" L*\_UV star-forming galaxy, likely directly or indirectly (by its effect on the radiation field) related to low dust abundance and low metallicity. The infrared-luminous modestly star-forming Lyman Break Galaxy ({LBG}) in our sample is characterized by an ionized-gas fraction (L\_[{CII}]/L\_[{NII}]{\textless}=20) typical of local star-forming galaxies and shows evidence for spatial variations in its ionized-gas fraction across an extended gas reservoir. The extreme {SFR}, warm and compact dusty starburst {AzTEC}-3 shows an ionized fraction lower than expected given its star-formation rate surface density (L\_[{CII}]/L\_[{NII}]=22+/-8) suggesting that [{NII}] dominantly traces a diffuse ionized medium rather than star-forming {HII} regions in this type of galaxy. This highest redshift sample of [{NII}] detections provides some of the first constraints on ionized and neutral gas modeling attempts and on the structure of the inter-stellar medium at z=5-6 in "normal" galaxies and starbursts.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the flow of metals through the circumgalactic medium in the Feedback in Realistic Environments ({FIRE}) simulations of galaxy formation, ranging from isolated dwarfs to \$L*\$. We find that nearly all metals produced in high-redshift galaxies are carried out in winds that escape the galaxy and reach \$0.25 R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$. When measured at \$0.25 R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$ the metallicity of outflows is greater than, but similar to the {ISM} metallicity. Many metals thus reside in a reservoir in the {CGM}. We find that the outflowing flux through \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$ is lower than that at \$0.25 R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$ by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim2-5\$. Cooling and recycling from this reservoir determine the metal budget in the {ISM}. The inflow metallicity at \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$ is generally very low, but outflow and inflow metallicities are similar in the inner halo. At low redshift, massive galaxies no longer generate outflows that reach the {CGM}, causing a divergence in {CGM} and {ISM} metallicity. Dwarf galaxies continue to generate outflows, which become increasingly dominated by metal-poor gas, while the galaxies themselves preferentially retains metal ejecta. In all but the least massive galaxy considered, a majority of the metals are within the halo at \$z=0\$. We measure the fraction of metals in {CGM}, {ISM}, stars, and roughly quantify the thermal state of {CGM} metals in each halo. The total amount of metals in the low-redshift {CGM} of two simulated L* galaxies is consistent with estimates from the {COS} halos survey, while for the other two it appears to be lower.},

	abstract = {In spite of their conjectured importance for the Epoch of Reionization, the properties of low-mass galaxies are currently still under large debate. In this article, we study the stellar and gaseous properties of faint, low-mass galaxies at z{\textgreater}3. We observed the Frontier Fields cluster Abell S1063 with {MUSE} over a 2 arcmin{\textasciicircum}2 field, and combined integral-field spectroscopy with gravitational lensing to perform a blind search for intrinsically faint Lya emitters ({LAEs}). We found in total 14 lensed {LAEs} and increased the number of spectroscopically-confirmed multiple-image families from 6 to 17, and updated our gravitational-lensing model accordingly. The lensing-corrected Lya luminosities are with L(Lya) {\textless}= 10{\textasciicircum}41.5 erg/s among the lowest for spectroscopically confirmed {LAEs} at any redshift. We used expanding gaseous shell models to fit the Lya line profile, and find low column densities and expansion velocities. This is to our knowledge the first time that gaseous properties of such faint galaxies at z{\textgreater}=3 are reported. We performed {SED} modelling to broadband photometry from the \{{\textbackslash}em U\}-band through the infrared to determine the stellar properties of these {LAEs}. The stellar masses are very low (10{\textasciicircum}\{6-8\} Msun), and are accompanied by very young ages of 1-100 Myr. The very high specific star formation rates ({\textasciitilde}100/Gyr) are characteristic of starburst galaxies, and we find that most galaxies will double their stellar mass in {\textless}20 Myr. The {UV}-continuum slopes beta are low in our sample, with beta{\textless}-2 for all galaxies with Mstar {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun. We conclude that low-mass galaxies at 3{\textless}z{\textless}6 are forming stars at higher rates than seen locally or in more massive galaxies.

	abstract = {We discuss new Keck/{MOSFIRE} spectroscopic observations of four luminous galaxies at z{\textasciitilde}7-9 selected to have intense optical line emission by Roberts-Borsani et al. (2016). Previous follow-up has revealed Lyman-alpha in two of the four galaxies. Our new {MOSFIRE} observations confirm that Lyman-alpha is present in the entire sample. We detect Lyman-alpha emission in {COS}-zs7-1, confirming its redshift as z=7.154, and we detect Lyman-alpha in {EGS}-zs8-2 at z=7.477, verifying a tentative detection presented in an earlier study. The ubiquity of Lyman-alpha in this sample is puzzling given that the {IGM} is likely significantly neutral over 7{\textless}z{\textless}9. To investigate this result in more detail, we have initiated a campaign to target {UV} metal emission in the four Lyman-alpha emitters as a probe of both the radiation field and the velocity offset of Lyman-alpha. Here we present the detection of intense {CIII}] emission in {EGS}-zs8-1, a galaxy from this sample previously shown to have Lyman-alpha at z=7.73. Photoionization models indicate that an intense radiation field and low metallicity are required to reproduce the intense {CIII}] and optical line emission. We argue that this extreme radiation field is likely to affect the local environment, increasing the transmission of Lyman-alpha through the galaxy. Moreover, the centroid of {CIII}] indicates that Lyman-alpha is redshifted from the systemic value by 340 km/s. This velocity offset is larger than that seen in less luminous systems, providing an additional explanation for the transmission of Lyman-alpha emission through the {IGM}. Since the transmission is further enhanced by the likelihood that such systems are also situated in the densest regions with the largest ionized bubbles, the visibility of Lyman-alpha at z{\textgreater}7 is expected to be strongly luminosity-dependent, with the most effective transmission occurring in systems with intense star formation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01242},
	abstract = {Massive stars are typically in star clusters and live short lives, so the supernovae ({SNe}) they produce are clustered in space and time. Since the amount of momentum that {SNe} can deliver to the interstellar medium depends on how their outflowing remnants make the transition from adiabatic to radiative, this clustering may alter the momentum budget per {SN}, an effect we systematically explore over a large parameter space. We perform a parameter study of 1D hydrodynamic simulations, varying the number of {SNe}, and the background gas metallicity and density. For a few {SNe}, we find that the asymptotic momentum scales superlinearly with the number of {SNe}. As a result, the asymptotic momentum per {SN} can be an order of magnitude greater than that delivered by isolated {SNe}, with a maximum efficiency occurring for clusters that produce {\textasciitilde}10-100 {SNe}. Adequately capturing this effect in simulations requires very high resolution to avoid over-cooling (a typical resolution for our simulations is 0.3 pc). We show that inadequate resolution led a number of previous studies to underestimate the momentum injection. This strong momentum feedback has significant implications for galactic and cosmological models, so we use our numeric results to construct a simple analytic fitting formula for the momentum of clustered {SNe} for use in semi-analytic and lower-resolution numeric work. Integrating our model over a realistic cluster mass function for a star-forming galaxy, we find that the total {SNe} momentum budget is {\textasciitilde}0.5-1 dex higher than the conventional value.},

The low-metallicity peak comprises (57 +/- 8)\% of the {pLLSs} and is centered at [X/H] {\textasciitilde} -1.87 (1.3\% solar metallicity), while the high-metallicity peak is centered at [X/H] {\textasciitilde} -0.32 (48\% solar metallicity). Although the sample of {LLSs} is still small, there is some evidence that the metallicity distributions of the {LLSs} and {pLLSs} are different, with a far lower fraction of very metal-poor ([X/H] {\textless} -1.4) {LLSs} than {pLLSs}.

However, higher H I column density absorbers (log N(H I) {\textgreater} 19.0) show a much lower fraction of metal-poor gas; therefore, the metallicity distribution of gas in and around galaxies depends sensitively on N(H I) at z {\textless} 1. We interpret the high-metallicity ([X/H] {\textgreater} -1) {pLLSs} and {LLSs} as arising in outflows, recycling winds, and tidally-stripped gas around galaxies. The low-metallicity {pLLSs} and {LLSs} imply that the {CGM} of z {\textless} 1 galaxies is also host to a substantial mass of cool, dense, low-metallicity gas that may ultimately accrete onto the galaxies.},

The particle-based {SPH} technique allows an intuitive and simple formulation of hydrodynamics that has excellent conservation properties and can be coupled to self-gravity with high accuracy. The Lagrangian character of {SPH} allows it to automatically adjust its resolution to the clumping of matter, a property that makes the scheme ideal for many application areas in astrophysics, where often a large dynamic range in density is encountered. We discuss the derivation of the basic {SPH} equations in their modern formulation, and give an overview about extensions of {SPH} developed to treat physics such as radiative transfer, thermal conduction, relativistic dynamics, or magnetic fields. We also briefly describe some of the most important applications areas of {SPH} in astrophysical research. Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the accuracy of {SPH} for different hydrodynamical problems, including measurements of its convergence rate for important classes of problems.},

	abstract = {We examine how three fundamentally different numerical hydrodynamics codes follow the evolution of an isothermal galactic disc with an external spiral potential. We compare an adaptive mesh refinement code ({RAMSES}), a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code ({sphNG}), and a volume-discretised meshless code ({GIZMO}). Using standard refinement criteria, we find that {RAMSES} produces a disc that is less vertically concentrated and does not reach such high densities as the {sphNG} or {GIZMO} runs. The gas surface density in the spiral arms increases at a lower rate for the {RAMSES} simulations compared to the other codes. There is also a greater degree of substructure in the {sphNG} and {GIZMO} runs and secondary spiral arms are more pronounced. By resolving the Jeans' length with a greater number of grid cells we achieve more similar results to the Lagrangian codes used in this study. Other alterations to the refinement scheme (adding extra levels of refinement and refining based on local density gradients) are less successful in reducing the disparity between {RAMSES} and {sphNG}/{GIZMO}. Although more similar, {sphNG} displays different density distributions and vertical mass profiles to all modes of {GIZMO} (including the smoothed particle hydrodynamics version). This suggests differences also arise which are not intrinsic to the particular method but rather due to its implementation. The discrepancies between codes (in particular, the densities reached in the spiral arms) could potentially result in differences in the locations and timescales for gravitational collapse, and therefore impact star formation activity in more complex galaxy disc simulations.},

We show that Horizon-{AGN}, which is not tuned to reproduce the local Universe, produces good overall agreement with these quantities, from the present day to the epoch when the Universe was 5\% of its current age. By comparison to Horizon-{noAGN}, a twin simulation without {AGN} feedback, we quantify how feedback from black holes is likely to help shape galaxy stellar-mass growth in the redshift range 0{\textless}z{\textless}6, particularly in the most massive galaxies. Our results demonstrate that Horizon-{AGN} successfully captures the evolutionary trends of observed galaxies over the lifetime of the Universe, making it an excellent tool for studying the processes that drive galaxy evolution and making predictions for the next generation of galaxy surveys.},

	abstract = {Massive black-hole binaries ({MBHBs}) are thought to be the main source of gravitational waves ({GWs}) in the low-frequency domain surveyed by ongoing and forthcoming Pulsar Timing Array campaigns and future space-borne missions, such as \{{\textbackslash}it {eLISA}\}. However, many low-redshift {MBHBs} in realistic astrophysical environments may not reach separations small enough to allow significant {GW} emission, but rather stall on (sub)pc-scale orbits. This "last-parsec problem" can be eased by the appearance of a third massive black hole ({MBH}) -- the "intruder" -- whose action can force, under certain conditions, the inner {MBHB} on a very eccentric orbit, hence allowing intense {GW} emission eventually leading to coalescence. A detailed assessment of the process, ultimately driven by the induced Kozai-Lidov oscillations of the {MBHB} orbit, requires a general relativistic treatment and the inclusion of external factors, such as the Newtonian precession of the intruder orbit in the galactic potential and its hardening by scattering off background stars. In order to tackle this problem, we developed a three-body Post-Newtonian ({PN}) code framed in a realistic galactic potential, including both non-dissipative 1PN and 2PN terms, and dissipative terms such as 2.5PN effects, orbital hardening of the outer binary, and the effect of the dynamical friction on the early stages of the intruder dynamics. In this first paper of a series devoted at studing the dynamics of {MBH} triplets from a cosmological perspective, we describe, test and validate our code.},

	abstract = {The abundances of matter halos in the universe are described by the so-called halo mass function ({HMF}). It enters most cosmological analyses and parametrizes how the linear growth of primordial perturbations is connected to these abundances. Interestingly, this connection can be made approximately cosmology independent. This made it possible to map in detail its near-universal behavior through large-scale simulations. However, such simulations may suffer from systematic effects, especially if baryonic physics is included. In this paper we ask how well observations can constrain directly the {HMF}. The observables we consider are galaxy cluster number counts, galaxy cluster power spectrum and lensing of type Ia supernovae. Our results show that {DES} is capable of putting the first meaningful constraints, while both Euclid and J-{PAS} can give constraints on the {HMF} parameters which are comparable to the ones from state-of-the-art simulations. We also find that an independent measurement of cluster masses is even more important for measuring the {HMF} than for constraining the cosmological parameters, and can vastly improve the determination of the halo mass function. Measuring the {HMF} could thus be used to cross-check simulations and their implementation of baryon physics. It could even, if deviations cannot be accounted for, hint at new physics.},

	abstract = {We present a physically clear cooling flow theory that explains the origin of warm diffuse gas seen primarily as highly ionized absorption line systems in the spectra of background sources. We predict the observed column densities of several highly ionized transitions such as O {VI}, O {VII}, Ne {VIII}, N V, and Mg X; and present a unified comparison of the model predictions with absorption lines seen in the Milky Way disk, Milky Way halo, starburst galaxies, the circumgalactic medium and the intergalactic medium at low and high redshifts. We show that diffuse gas seen in such diverse environments can be simultaneously explained by a simple model of radiatively cooling gas. We show that most of such absorption line systems are consistent with being collisionally ionized, and estimate the maximum likelihood temperature of the gas in each observation. This model satisfactorily explains why O {VI} is regularly observed around star-forming low-z L* galaxies, and why N V is rarely seen around the same galaxies. We predict that the typical O {VI} column densities seen around these galaxies would be an order of magnitude higher than the associated N V column densities. We further present some consequences of this model in quantifying the dynamics of the cooling gas around galaxies and predict the shock velocities associated with such flows. Useful formulae for both observers and simulators are presented.},

	abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope far-{UV} spectra of 4 {QSOs} whose sightlines pass through the halo of {NGC} 1097 at impact parameters of 48 -165 kpc. {NGC} 1097 is a nearby spiral galaxy that has undergone at least two minor merger events, but no apparent major mergers, and is relatively isolated with respect to other nearby bright galaxies. This makes {NGC} 1097 a good case study for exploring baryons in a paradigmatic bright-galaxy halo. Lyman-alpha absorption is detected along all sightlines and Si {III} 1206 is found along the 3 smallest impact parameter sightlines; metal lines of C {II}, Si {II} and Si {IV} are only found with certainty towards the inner-most sightline. The kinematics of the absorption lines are best replicated by a model with a disk-like distribution of gas approximately planar to the observed 21 cm H I disk, that is rotating more slowly than the inner disk, and into which gas is infalling from the intergalactic medium. Some part of the absorption towards the inner-most sightline may arise either from a small-scale outflow, or from tidal debris associated with the minor merger that gives rise to the well known `dog-leg' stellar stream that projects from {NGC} 1097. When compared to other studies, {NGC} 1097 appears to be a `typical' absorber, although the large dispersion in absorption line column density and equivalent width in a single halo goes perhaps some way in explaining the wide range of these values seen in higher-redshift studies.},

We have developed a new method for spatially resolving emission lines in {HST}/{WFC}3 G141 grism spectra and quantifying {AGN} activity through the spatial gradient of the [O {III}]/H\${\textbackslash}beta\$ line ratio. Through detailed simulations, we show that our novel line-ratio gradient approach identifies {\textasciitilde} sim 40\% more low-mass and obscured {AGN} than obtained by classical methods.

We apply our technique to previously studied stacked samples of galaxies at z {\textasciitilde}2 and find that our results are consistent with these studies.

We undertake a detailed comparison of the simulations to high resolution, high signal-to-noise observations of the Lyman-alpha forest over the redshift range 2 {\textless} z {\textless} 5. The simulations are in very good agreement with the observational data, lending further support to the paradigm that the Lyman-alpha forest is a natural consequence of the web-like distribution of matter arising in {LCDM} cosmological models. Only a small number of minor discrepancies remain with respect to the observational data. Saturated Lyman-alpha absorption lines with column densities N\_HI {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}14.5 cm{\textasciicircum}-2 at 2 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 are underpredicted in the models. An uncertain correction for continuum placement bias is required to match the distribution and power spectrum of the transmitted flux, particularly at z {\textgreater} 4. Finally, the temperature of intergalactic gas in the simulations may be slightly too low at z=2.7 and a flatter temperature-density relation is required at z=2.4, consistent with the expected effects of non-equilibrium ionisation during He-{II} reionisation.},

The relation is remarkably tight with a scatter \${\textbackslash}sigma {\textbackslash}sim\$0.06 dex, or 14\%.

The galaxies in our high-resolution zoom runs exhibit a bursty mode of star formation with gas consumption timescales 10 times shorter than for the normal star formation mode. The strong bursts are only present in the simulations with the highest resolution, hinting that a too low resolution is the reason why the original Illustris simulation showed a dearth of starburst galaxies. Very pronounced bursts of star formation occur in two out of four major mergers we study. The high star formation rates, the short gas consumption timescales and the morphology of these systems strongly resemble observed nuclear starbursts. This is the first time that a sample of major mergers is studied through self-consistent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations instead of using isolated galaxy models setup on a collision course. We also study the orbits of the colliding galaxies and find that the starbursting gas preferentially appears in head-on mergers with very high collision velocities.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07122},
	abstract = {With the aim of exploring the fast evolutionary path from the blue cloud of star-forming galaxies to the red sequence of quiescent galaxies in the local universe, we select a local advanced merging infrared luminous and ultraluminous galaxy (adv-merger (U){LIRGs}) sample and perform careful dust extinction corrections to investigate their positions in the {SFR}-\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}\$, u-r and {NUV}-r color-mass diagrams. The sample consists of 89 (U){LIRGs} at the late merger stage, obtained from cross-correlating the {IRAS} Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey and 1 Jy {ULIRGs} samples with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey {DR}7 database. Our results show that \$74{\textbackslash}\%{\textbackslash}pm 5{\textbackslash}\%\$ of adv-merger (U){LIRGs} are localized above the \$1{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}sigma\$ line of the local star-forming galaxy main sequence. We also find that all adv-merger (U){LIRGs} are more massive than and as blue as the blue cloud galaxies after corrections of Galactic and internal dust extinctions, with \$95{\textbackslash}\%{\textbackslash}pm 2{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$81{\textbackslash}\%{\textbackslash}pm 4{\textbackslash}\%\$ of them outside the blue cloud on the u-r and {NUV}-r color-mass diagrams, respectively. These results, combined with the short timescale for exhausting the molecular gas reservoir in adv-merger (U){LIRGs} (\$3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$ to \$3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}\$ years), imply that the adv-merger (U){LIRGs} are likely at the starting point of the fast evolutionary track previously proposed by several groups. While the number density of adv-merger (U){LIRGs} is only \${\textbackslash}sim 0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the blue cloud star-forming galaxies in the local universe, this evolutionary track may play a more important role at high redshift.},

	abstract = {The need for the extra dimension in Kustaanheimo-Stiefel ({KS}) regularization is explained by the topology of the Hopf fibration, which defines the geometry and structure of {KS} space. A trajectory in Cartesian space is represented by a four-dimensional manifold, called the fundamental manifold. Based on geometric and topological aspects classical concepts of stability are translated to {KS} language. The separation between manifolds of solutions generalizes the concept of Lyapunov stability. The dimension-raising nature of the fibration transforms fixed points, limit cycles, attractive sets, and Poincar{\textbackslash}'e sections to higher-dimensional subspaces. From these concepts chaotic systems are studied. In strongly perturbed problems the numerical error can break the topological structure of {KS} space: points in a fiber are no longer transformed to the same point in Cartesian space. An observer in three dimensions will see orbits departing from the same initial conditions but diverging in time. This apparent randomness of the integration can only be understood in four dimensions. The concept of topological stability results in a simple method for estimating the time scale in which numerical simulations can be trusted. Ideally all trajectories departing from the same fiber should be {KS} transformed to a unique trajectory in three-dimensional space, because the fundamental manifold that they constitute is unique. By monitoring how trajectories departing from one fiber separate from the fundamental manifold a critical time, equivalent to the Lyapunov time, is estimated. These concepts are tested on N-body examples: the Pythagorean problem, and an example of field stars interacting with a binary.},

We present cygrid, a library module for the general purpose programming language Python. Cygrid can be used to resample data to any collection of target coordinates, although its typical application involves {FITS} maps or data cubes. The {FITS} world coordinate system standard is supported. The regridding algorithm is based on the convolution of the original samples with a kernel of arbitrary shape. We introduce a lookup table scheme that allows us to parallelize the gridding and combine it with the {HEALPix} tessellation of the sphere for fast neighbor searches. We show that for \$n\$ input data points, cygrids runtime scales between O(n) and O(n log n) and analyze the performance gain that is achieved using multiple {CPU} cores. We also compare the gridding speed with other techniques, such as nearest-neighbor, and linear and cubic spline interpolation. Cygrid is a very fast and versatile gridding library that significantly outperforms other third-party Python modules, such as the linear and cubic spline interpolation provided by {SciPy}.},

	abstract = {We present an implementation of stellar evolution and chemical feedback for smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. We consider the timed release of individual elements by both massive (Type {II} supernovae and stellar winds) and intermediate-mass stars (Type Ia supernovae and asymptotic giant branch stars). We illustrate the results of our method using a suite of cosmological simulations that include new prescriptions for radiative cooling, star formation and galactic winds. Radiative cooling is implemented element-by-element, in the presence of an ionizing radiation background, and we track all 11 elements that contribute significantly to the radiative cooling. While all simulations presented here use a single set of physical parameters, we take specific care to investigate the robustness of the predictions of chemodynamical simulations with respect to the ingredients, the methods and the numerical convergence. A comparison of nucleosynthetic yields taken from the literature indicates that relative abundance ratios may only be reliable at the factor of 2 level, even for a fixed initial mass function. Abundances relative to iron are even more uncertain because the rate of Type Ia supernovae is not well known. We contrast two reasonable definitions of the metallicity of a resolution element and find that while they agree for high metallicities, there are large differences at low metallicities. We argue that the discrepancy is indicative of the lack of metal mixing caused by the fact that metals are stuck to particles. We argue that since this is a (numerical) sampling problem, solving it by using a poorly constrained physical process such as diffusion could have undesired consequences. We demonstrate that the two metallicity definitions result in redshift z = 0 stellar masses that can differ by up to a factor of 2, because of the sensitivity of the cooling rates to the elemental abundances. Finally, we use several 5123 particle simulations to investigate the evolution of the distribution of heavy elements, which we find to be in reasonably good agreement with available observational constraints. We find that by z = 0 most of the metals are locked up in stars. The gaseous metals are distributed over a very wide range of gas densities and temperatures. The shock-heated warm-hot intergalactic medium has a relatively high metallicity of {\textasciitilde}10-1Zsolar that evolves only weakly, and is therefore an important reservoir of metals. Any census aiming to account for most of the metal mass will have to take a wide variety of objects and structures into account.},

	abstract = {We compare the properties of galaxies that form in a cosmological simulation without strong feedback to observations of the z = 0 galaxy population. We confirm previous findings that models without strong feedback overproduce the observed galaxy baryonic mass function, especially at the low- and high-mass extremes. Through post-processing we investigate what kinds of feedback would be required to reproduce the statistics of observed galaxy masses and star formation rates. To mimic an extreme form of `preventive' feedback, such as a highly efficient active galactic nucleus `radio mode', we remove all baryonic mass that was originally accreted from shock-heated gas (`hot-mode' accretion). This removal does not bring the high-mass end of the galaxy mass function into agreement with observations because much of the stellar mass in these systems formed at high redshift from baryons that originally accreted via `cold mode' on to lower mass progenitors. An efficient `ejective' feedback mechanism, such as supernova-driven galactic winds, must reduce the masses of these progenitors before they merge to form today's massive galaxies. Feedback must also reduce the masses of lower mass z = 0 galaxies, which assemble at lower redshifts and have much lower star formation rates. If we monotonically remap galaxy masses to reproduce the observed mass function, but retain the simulation-predicted star formation rates, we obtain fairly good agreement with the observed sequence of star-forming galaxies. However, we fail to recover the observed population of passive, low star formation rate galaxies, especially at the high-mass end. Suppressing all hot-mode accretion improves the agreement for high-mass galaxies, but it worsens the agreement at intermediate masses. Reproducing these z = 0 observations requires a feedback mechanism that dramatically suppresses star formation in a fraction of galaxies, increasing with mass, while leaving star formation rates of other galaxies essentially unchanged.},

	abstract = {Various formulations of smooth-particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) have been proposed, intended to resolve certain difficulties in the treatment of fluid mixing instabilities. Most have involved changes to the algorithm which either introduce artificial correction terms or violate arguably the greatest advantage of {SPH} over other methods: manifest conservation of energy, entropy, momentum, and angular momentum. Here, we show how a class of alternative {SPH} equations of motion ({EOM}) can be derived self-consistently from a discrete particle Lagrangian (guaranteeing manifest conservation) in a manner which tremendously improves treatment of instabilities and contact discontinuities. Saitoh \& Makino recently noted that the volume element used to discretize the {EOM} does not need to explicitly invoke the mass density (as in the 'standard' approach); we show how this insight, and the resulting degree of freedom, can be incorporated into the rigorous Lagrangian formulation that retains ideal conservation properties and includes the 'Grad-h' terms that account for variable smoothing lengths. We derive a general {EOM} for any choice of volume element (particle 'weights') and method of determining smoothing lengths. We then specify this to a 'pressure-entropy formulation' which resolves problems in the traditional treatment of fluid interfaces. Implementing this in a new version of the {GADGET} code, we show it leads to good performance in mixing experiments (e.g. Kelvin-Helmholtz \& blob tests). And conservation is maintained even in strong shock/blastwave tests, where formulations without manifest conservation produce large errors. This also improves the treatment of sub-sonic turbulence, and lessens the need for large kernel particle numbers. The code changes are trivial and entail no additional numerical expense. This provides a general framework for self-consistent derivation of different 'flavors' of {SPH}.},

	abstract = {We examine the temperature history of gas accreted by forming galaxies in {SPH} simulations. About half the gas shock heats to roughly the virial temperature of the galaxy potential well before cooling, condensing, and forming stars, but the other half radiates its acquired gravitational energy at much lower temperatures, typically T{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}5 K, and the histogram of maximum gas temperatures is clearly bimodal. The "cold mode" of gas accretion dominates for low mass galaxies (M\_baryon {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.3\}Msun or M\_halo {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.4\}Msun), while the conventional "hot mode" dominates the growth of high mass systems. Cold accretion is often directed along filaments, allowing galaxies to efficiently draw gas from large distances, while hot accretion is quasi-spherical. The galaxy and halo mass dependence leads to redshift and environment dependence of cold and hot accretion rates, with cold mode dominating at high redshift and in low density regions today, and hot mode dominating in group and cluster environments at low redshift. Star formation rates closely track accretion rates, and we discuss the physics behind the observed environment and redshift dependence of galactic scale star formation. If we allowed hot accretion to be suppressed by conduction or {AGN} feedback, then the simulation predictions would change in interesting ways, perhaps resolving conflicts with the colors of ellipticals and the cutoff of the galaxy luminosity function. The transition between cold and hot accretion at M\_h {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.4\}Msun is similar to that found by Birnboim \& Dekel (2003) using 1-d simulations and analytic arguments. The corresponding baryonic mass is tantalizingly close to the scale at which Kauffmann et al. (2003) find a marked shift in galaxy properties. We speculate on connections between these theoretical and observational transitions.},

	abstract = {[Abridged] Whether technological societies remain small and planet-bound like our own, or ultimately span across galaxies is an open question in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. Societies that engineer on a galactic scale are classified as Type {III} on Kardashev's scale. I argue that Type {III} societies can take the form of blackboxes, entire galaxies veiled in an opaque screen. A blackbox has a temperature that is just above that of the cosmic microwave background. The screen can be made from artificial dust pervading the galaxy. I show that there is enough material in galaxies to build blackboxes if the dust is fashioned into dipole antennas. The thermal emission of a blackbox makes it a bright microwave source. I examine the Planck Catalog of Compact Sources to constrain the abundance of blackboxes. None of the 100 {GHz} sources has the spectrum expected of a blackbox. The null result rules out shrouded galaxy clusters out to z {\textasciitilde} 1 and shrouded Milky Ways out to (comoving) 700 Mpc. The reach of the results includes 3 million galaxies containing an estimated 300 quadrillion terrestrial planets, as well as tens of thousands of galaxy clusters. Combined with the null results from other searches for Type {III} societies, I conclude that they are so rare that they basically do not exist within the observable Universe. A hypothesis of "Cosmic Pessimism" is discussed, in which we are alone, our long-term chances for survival are slim, and if we do survive, our future history will be checkered. Our loneliness is suggested by the lack of Type {III} societies. I discuss the remaining forms of Type {III} societies not yet well constrained by observation. I argue that the ease of building blackboxes on planetary and Solar System scales may lead, within a few centuries, to environmental catastrophes vastly more devastating than anything we are doing now, boding ill for us.},

	abstract = {We use the {OMEGA} galactic chemical evolution code to investigate how the assumptions used for the treatment of galactic inflows and outflows impact numerical predictions. The goal is to determine how our capacity to reproduce the chemical evolution trends of a galaxy is affected by the choice of implementation used to include those physical processes. In pursuit of this goal, we experiment with three different prescriptions for galactic inflows and outflows and use {OMEGA} within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code to recover the set of input parameters that best reproduces the chemical evolution of nine elements in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Sculptor. Despite their different degrees of intended physical realism, we found that all three prescriptions can reproduce in an almost identical way the stellar abundance trends observed in Sculptor. While the three models have the same capacity to fit the data, the best values recovered for the parameters controlling the number of Type Ia supernovae and the strength of galactic outflows, are substantially different and in fact mutually exclusive from one model to another. For the purpose of understanding how a galaxy evolves, we conclude that only reproducing the evolution of a limited number of elements is insufficient and can lead to misleading conclusions. More elements or additional constraints such as the galaxy's star formation efficiency and the gas fraction are needed in order to break the degeneracy between the different modeling assumptions. On the other hand, from a stellar evolution perspective, our results are encouraging since they suggest that we do not need a complex model to test and validate stellar yields. In that regard, as long as the main ingredients are included in a model, the complexity and the choice of implementation do not really matter.},

	abstract = {We have obtained moderate resolution (R=few thousand) spectra of the Na I λλ5890, 5896 (Na D) absorption line in a sample of 32 far-{IR}-bright starburst galaxies. In 18 cases, the Na D line in the nucleus is produced primarily by interstellar gas, while cool stars contribute significantly in the others. In 12 of the 18 ``interstellar-dominated'' cases the Na D line is blueshifted by over 100 km s-1 relative to the galaxy systemic velocity (the ``outflow sources''), while no case shows a net redshift of more than 100 km s-1. The absorption-line profiles in these outflow sources span the range from near the galaxy systemic velocity to a maximum blueshift of {\textasciitilde}400-600 km s-1. The outflow sources are galaxies systematically viewed more nearly face-on than the others. We therefore argue that the absorbing material consists of ambient interstellar material that has been entrained and accelerated along the minor axis of the galaxy by a hot starburst-driven superwind. The Na D lines are optically thick, but indirect arguments imply total hydrogen column densities of {NH}{\textasciitilde}few×1021 cm-2. This implies that the superwind is expelling matter at a rate comparable to the star formation rate. This outflowing material is evidently very dusty: we find a strong correlation between the depth of the Na D profile and the line-of-sight reddening. Typical implied values are E(B-V)=0.3-1 over regions several-to-10 kpc in size. We briefly consider some of the potential implications of these observations. The estimated terminal velocities of superwinds inferred from the present data and extant X-ray data are typically 400-800 km-1, are independent of the galaxy rotation speed, and are comparable to (substantially exceed) the escape velocities for L* (dwarf) galaxies. The resulting selective loss of metals from shallower potential wells can establish the mass-metallicity relation in spheroids, produce the observed metallicity in the intracluster medium, and enrich a general {IGM} to of order 10-1 solar metallicity. If the outflowing dust grains can survive their journey into the {IGM}, their effect on observations of cosmologically distant objects would be significant.},

	abstract = {Negative feedback from active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) is considered a key mechanism in shaping galaxy evolution. Fast, extended outflows are frequently detected in the {AGN} host galaxies at all redshifts and luminosities, both in ionised and molecular gas. However, these outflows are only "potentially" able to quench star formation and we are still missing a decisive evidence of negative feedback in action. Here we present Spectrograph for {INtegral} Field Observations in the Near Infrared ({SINFONI}) H- and K-band integral-field spectroscopic observations of two quasars at \$z{\textbackslash}sim\$2.4 characterised by fast, extended outflows detected through the [{OIII}]\${\textbackslash}lambda\$5007 line (Carniani et al. 2015). The high signal-to-noise ratio of our observations allows us to identify faint narrow ({FWHM} \${\textless} 500\$ km/s), and spatially extended components in [{OIII}]\${\textbackslash}lambda\$5007 and H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission associated with star formation in the host galaxy. Such star-formation powered emission is spatially anti-correlated with the fast outflows. The ionised outflows therefore appear to be able to suppress star formation in the region where the outflow is expanding. However the detection of narrow, spatially-extended H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission indicates star formation rates of at least \${\textbackslash}sim 50-90\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$/yr, suggesting either that {AGN} feedback does not affect the whole galaxy or that many feedback episodes are required before star formation is completely quenched. On the other hand, the narrow H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission extending along the edges of the outflow cone may lead also to a positive feedback interpretation.

	abstract = {The South Pole Telescope has discovered one hundred gravitationally lensed, high-redshift, dusty, star-forming galaxies ({DSFGs}). We present 0.5" resolution 870um Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array imaging of a sample of 47 {DSFGs} spanning z=1.9-5.7, and construct gravitational lens models of these sources. Our visibility-based lens modeling incorporates several sources of residual interferometric calibration uncertainty, allowing us to properly account for noise in the observations. At least 70\% of the sources are strongly lensed by foreground galaxies (mu\_870um {\textgreater} 2), with a median magnification mu\_870um = 6.3, extending to mu\_870um {\textgreater} 30. We compare the intrinsic size distribution of the strongly lensed sources to a similar number of unlensed {DSFGs} and find no significant differences in spite of a bias between the magnification and intrinsic source size. This may indicate that the true size distribution of {DSFGs} is relatively narrow. We use the source sizes to constrain the wavelength at which the dust optical depth is unity and find this wavelength to be correlated with the dust temperature. This correlation leads to discrepancies in dust mass estimates of a factor of 2 compared to estimates using a single value for this wavelength. We investigate the relationship between the [{CII}] line and the far-infrared luminosity and find that the same correlation between the [{CII}]L\_FIR ratio and Sigma\_FIR found for low-redshift star-forming galaxies applies to high-redshift galaxies and extends at least two orders of magnitude higher in Sigma\_FIR. This lends further credence to the claim that the compactness of the {IR}-emitting region is the controlling parameter in establishing the "[{CII}] deficit."},

	abstract = {We present the first attempt to detect outflows from galaxies approaching the Epoch of Reionization ({EoR}) using a sample of 9 star-forming (5 {\textless} {SFR} {\textless} 70 Msun/yr) z {\textasciitilde} 6 galaxies for which high-quality spectra of the [{CII}]158 micron line has been previously obtained with {ALMA}. We first fit each line with a Gaussian function and compute the residuals by subtracting the best fitting model from the data. We combine the residuals of all sample galaxies and find that the total signal is characterized by a flux excess that can be ascribed to broad wings of the [{CII}] line, which we interpret as a signature of starburst-driven outflows. The inferred outflow rate is {dM}/dt {\textasciitilde} 20 Msun/yr. Our interpretation is consistent with results from zoomed hydro- simulations of Dahlia, a z {\textasciitilde} 7 galaxy ({SFR} {\textasciitilde} 100 Msun/yr) whose feedback-regulated star formation results in an outflow rate {dM}/dt {\textasciitilde} 30 Msun/yr. These results suggest that starburst-driven outflows are in place in the {EoR}. Deeper observations of the [{CII}] line in the galaxies of this sample are required to better characterize stellar feedback at high-z and to understand the role of outflows in shaping early galaxy formation.},

When the ratio of {FUV}- and H\${\textbackslash}beta\$-derived {SFRs} is measured, dust extinction correction is negligible (except for very dusty galaxies) with the Calzetti attenuation curve. The {FUV}--to--H\${\textbackslash}beta\$ ratio of our sample increases with the decrease of M* and {SFR}. The median ratio is \${\textbackslash}sim\$1 at M* \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ (or {SFR} = 20 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$/yr) and increases to \${\textbackslash}sim\$1.6 at M* \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{8.5\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ (or {SFR} \${\textbackslash}sim 0.5 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$/yr).

Bursty {SFH} on a timescale of \${\textbackslash}sim\$10 Myr on galactic scales provides a plausible explanation of our results, and the importance of the burstiness increases as M* decreases. Due to sample selection effects, our {FUV}--to--H\${\textbackslash}beta\$ ratio may be a lower limit of the true value of a complete sample, which strengthens our conclusions.

	abstract = {Observation shows that cooling instabilities leading to nebular emission, molecular gas, and star formation in giant galaxies are formed behind buoyantly-rising X-ray bubbles inflated by radio jets launched from massive nuclear black holes. We propose a model where molecular clouds condense from hot but relatively low entropy gas lifted by X-ray bubbles to an altitude where its cooling time is shorter than the time required for it to fall to its equilibrium location in the galaxy i.e., t\_c/t\_I {\textless}{\textasciitilde}1\$. Here the infall time can exceed the free-fall time, t\_ff, by factors of a few. This mechanism, which we refer to as stimulated feedback, is motivated by recent {ALMA} observations of central galaxies in clusters and groups revealing molecular clouds apparently forming in the wakes of rising X-ray bubbles and with surprisingly low cloud velocities. Supported by recent numerical simulations, our model would naturally sustain a continual feedback-loop in galaxies fuelled by cooling gas stimulated by radio-mechanical feedback itself, that otherwise stabilizes cooling atmospheres on larger scales. The observed cooling time threshold for the onset of nebular emission and star formation of {\textasciitilde} 5x10{\textasciicircum}8 yr may result from the limited ability of radio bubbles to lift low entropy gas to an altitude where thermal instabilities can ensue. The molecular clouds condensing from the outflowing hot gas are unlikely to escape, but instead return to the central galaxy in a circulating flow.},

The new method combines the information available from different sightlines during the photoionization modeling, thus yielding tighter constraints on {CGM} properties compared to traditional methods which model each sightline individually. Applying this new technique to the {COS}-Halos survey of low-redshift {\textasciitilde}L* galaxies, we find that we can reproduce all observed ion columns in all 44 galaxies in the sample, from the low-ions to {OVI}, with a single universal density structure for the cool {CGM}. The gas densities span the range 50 {\textless} {\textbackslash}rho/{\textbackslash}rho\_mean {\textless} 5x10{\textasciicircum}5 ({\textbackslash}rho\_mean is the cosmic mean), while the physical size of individual clouds scales as {\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rho{\textasciicircum}-1, from {\textasciitilde}35 kpc of the low density {OVI} clouds to {\textasciitilde}6 pc of the highest density low-ion clouds. The deduced cloud sizes are too small for this density structure to be driven by self-gravity, thus its physical origin is unclear. The implied cool {CGM} mass within the virial radius is 1.3x10{\textasciicircum}10 M\_sun ({\textasciitilde}1\% of the halo mass), distributed rather uniformly over the four decades in density. The mean cool gas density profile scales as R{\textasciicircum}-1.0, where R is the distance from the galaxy center. We construct a 3D model of the cool {CGM} based on our results, which we argue provides a benchmark for the {CGM} structure in hydrodynamic simulations.

We obtained higher-resolution spectra with the Keck Echellette Spectrograph and Imager, selecting targets according to our stratification scheme in an effort to fully sample the {LLS} population metallicity distribution. We established a plausible range of H I column densities and measured column densities (or limits) for ions of carbon, silicon, and aluminum, finding ionization-corrected metallicities or upper limits. Interestingly, our ionization models were better constrained with enhanced \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-to-aluminum abundances, with a median abundance ratio of [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Al]=0.3. Measured metallicities were generally low, ranging from [M/H]=-3 to -1.68, with even lower metallicities likely for some systems with upper limits. Using survival statistics to incorporate limits, we constructed the cumulative distribution function ({CDF}) for {LLS} metallicities. Recent models of galaxy evolution propose that galaxies replenish their gas from the low-metallicity intergalactic medium ({IGM}) via high-density H I "flows" and eject enriched interstellar gas via outflows. Thus, there has been some expectation that {LLSs} at the peak of cosmic star formation (\$z{\textbackslash}approx3\$) might have a bimodal metallicity distribution. We modeled our {CDF} as a mix of two Gaussian distributions, one reflecting the metallicity of the {IGM} and the other representative of the interstellar medium of star-forming galaxies. This bimodal distribution yielded a poor fit. A single Gaussian distribution better represented the sample with a low mean metallicity of [M/H] \${\textbackslash}approx -2.5\$.},

	abstract = {A large amount of observations have constrained cosmological parameters and the initial density fluctuation spectrum to a very high accuracy. However, cosmological parameters change with time and the power index of the power spectrum dramatically varies with mass scale in the so-called concordance Λ{CDM} cosmology. Thus, any successful model for its structural evolution should work well simultaneously for various cosmological models and different power spectra. We use a large set of high-resolution N-body simulations of a variety of structure formation models (scale-free, standard {CDM}, open {CDM}, and Λ{CDM}) to study the mass accretion histories, the mass and redshift dependence of concentrations, and the concentration evolution histories of dark matter halos. We find that there is significant disagreement between the much-used empirical models in the literature and our simulations. Based on our simulation results, we find that the mass accretion rate of a halo is tightly correlated with a simple function of its mass, the redshift, parameters of the cosmology, and of the initial density fluctuation spectrum, which correctly disentangles the effects of all these factors and halo environments. We also find that the concentration of a halo is strongly correlated with the universe age when its progenitor on the mass accretion history first reaches 4\% of its current mass. According to these correlations, we develop new empirical models for both the mass accretion histories and the concentration evolution histories of dark matter halos, and the latter can also be used to predict the mass and redshift dependence of halo concentrations. These models are accurate and universal: the same set of model parameters works well for different cosmological models and for halos of different masses at different redshifts, and in the Λ{CDM} case the model predictions match the simulation results very well even though halo mass is traced to about 0.0005 times the final mass, when cosmological parameters and the power index of the initial density fluctuation spectrum have changed dramatically. Our model predictions also match the {PINOCCHIO} mass accretion histories very well, which are much independent of our numerical simulations and our definitions of halo merger trees. These models are also simple and easy to implement, making them very useful in modeling the growth and structure of dark matter halos. We provide appendices describing the step-by-step implementation of our models. A calculator which allows one to interactively generate data for any given cosmological model is provided on the Web, together with a user-friendly code to make the relevant calculations and some tables listing the expected concentration as a function of halo mass and redshift in several popular cosmological models. We explain why Λ{CDM} and open {CDM} halos on nearly all mass scales show two distinct phases in their mass growth histories. We discuss implications of the universal relations we find in connection to the formation of dark matter halos in the cosmic density field.},

Their formation at such early epochs is still an enigma. Different pathways have been suggested to assemble supermassive black holes in the first billion years after the big bang. Direct collapse has emerged as a highly plausible scenario to form black holes as it provides seed masses of 105–106M?.Gravitational collapse in atomic cooling haloes with virial temperatures Tvir ≥ 104 K may lead to the formation of massive seed black holes in the presence of an intense background ultraviolet flux. Turbulence plays a central role in regulating accretion and transporting angular momentum. We present here the highest resolution cosmological large eddy simulations to date which track the evolution of high-density regions on scales of 0.25 au beyond the formation of the first peak, and study the impact of subgrid-scale turbulence. The peak density reached in these simulations is 1.2 × 10−8 gcm−3. Our findings show that while fragmentation occasionally occurs, it does not prevent the growth of a central massive object resulting from turbulent accretion and occasional mergers. The central object reaches ∼1000M? within four free-fall times, and we expect further growth up to 106M? through accretion in about 1Myr. The direct collapse model thus provides a viable pathway of forming high-mass black holes at early cosmic times},

We follow the evolution of gas within {DM} halos of 2 x 10{\textasciicircum}8 Mo and 1 kpc. We adopt cosmological density profiles and j-distributions. Our goal is to understand how the collapsing flow overcomes the centrifugal barrier and whether it is subject to fragmentation. We find that the collapse leads either to a central runaway or to off-center fragmentation. A disk-like configuration is formed inside the centrifugal barrier. For more cuspy {DM} distribution, the gas collapses more and experiences a bar-like perturbation and a central runaway. We have followed this inflow down to {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\} pc. The flow remains isothermal and the specific angular momentum is efficiently transferred by gravitational torques in a cascade of nested bars. This cascade supports a self-similar, disk-like collapse. In the collapsing phase, virial supersonic turbulence develops and fragmentation is damped. For larger initial {DM} cores the timescales become longer. In models with more organized initial rotation, a torus forms and appears to be supported by turbulent motions. The evolution depends on the competition between two timescales, corresponding to the onset of the central runaway and off-center fragmentation. For less organized rotation, the torus is greatly weakened, the central accretion timescale is shortened, and off-center fragmentation is suppressed --- triggering the central runaway even in previously `stable' models. The resulting {SMBH} masses lie in the range 2 x 10{\textasciicircum}4 Mo - 2 x 10{\textasciicircum}6 Mo, much higher than for Population {III} remnants. We argue that the above upper limit appears to be more realistic mass. Corollaries of this model include a possible correlation between {SMBH} and {DM} halo masses, and similarity between the {SMBH} and halo mass functions, at time of formation.},

We focus on the black hole mass function, Eddington ratio distribution and the implied duty cycle of nuclear activity. The simulation is broadly consistent with observational constraints on these quantities. In order to make a more direct comparison with observational data, we calculate the soft and hard X-ray luminosity functions of the active galactic nuclei ({AGN}). Between redshifts \$0\$ and \$1\$, the simulation is in agreement with data. At higher redshifts, the simulation tends to underpredict the luminosities of the brightest observed {AGN}. This may be due to the limited volume of the simulation, or a fundamental deficiency of the underlying model. It seems unlikely that additional unresolved variability can account for this difference.

	abstract = {Knowledge of galaxy evolution rests on cross-sectional observations of different objects at different times. Understanding of galaxy evolution rests on longitudinal interpretations of how these data relate to individual objects moving through time. The connection between the two is generally assumed to be clear, but we use a simple "physics-free" model to show that it is not and that exploring its nuances can lead to new insights. Comprising nothing more than \${\textbackslash}sim2000\$ loosely constrained lognormal star formation histories, the model faithfully reproduces the following data it was never designed to match: stellar mass functions at \$z{\textbackslash}leq8\$; the slope of the star formation rate/stellar mass relation (the {SF} "Main Sequence") at \$z{\textbackslash}leq6\$; the mean \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {sSFR}\}({\textbackslash}equiv\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}/M\_*)\$ of low-mass galaxies at \$z{\textbackslash}leq7\$; "fast-" and "slow-track quenching"; galaxy downsizing; and a correlation between formation timescale and \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {sSFR}\}(M\_*,t)\$ similar to recent results from simulations that provides a natural connection to bulge growth. We take these surprising findings -- which ultimately imply that quenching is the "peeling-off" of the densest tail of the starforming population at any epoch -- to mean either that: (1) models in which galaxies are diversified on long timescales by something akin to initial conditions rival the dominant "grow-and-quench" framework as good descriptions of the data; or (2) cornerstone metrics of galaxy evolution are too information-poor -- if not intrinsically misleading -- to confirm a unique explanation. We outline future tests of our model but stress that, even if it is shown to be incorrect, it illustrates how exploring different evolutionary paradigms can aid learning and, we hope, more detailed modeling efforts.},

	abstract = {Supermassive black holes ({SMBHs}) are ubiquitous in galaxies with a sizable mass. It is expected that a pair of {SMBHs} originally in the nuclei of two merging galaxies would form a binary and eventually coalesce via a burst of gravitational waves. So far theoretical models and simulations have been unable to predict directly the {SMBH} merger timescale from ab-initio galaxy formation theory, focusing only on limited phases of the orbital decay of {SMBHs} under idealized conditions of the galaxy hosts. The predicted {SMBH} merger timescales are long, of order Gyrs, which could be problematic for future gravitational wave searches. Here we present the first multi-scale \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} cosmological simulation that follows the orbital decay of a pair of {SMBHs} in a merger of two typical massive galaxies at \$z{\textbackslash}sim3\$, all the way to the final coalescence driven by gravitational wave emission. The two {SMBHs}, with masses \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, settle quickly in the nucleus of the merger remnant. The remnant is triaxial and extremely dense due to the dissipative nature of the merger and the intrinsic compactness of galaxies at high redshift. Such properties naturally allow a very efficient hardening of the {SMBH} binary. The {SMBH} merger occurs in only \${\textbackslash}sim10\$ Myr after the galactic cores have merged, which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the Hubble time.},

	abstract = {[Abridged] Aims. We study the properties of filamentary structures from the {ATLASGAL} survey. Methods. We use the {DisPerSE} algorithm to identify spatially coherent structures located across the inner-Galaxy (300 {\textless} l {\textless} 60 and {\textbar}b{\textbar} {\textless} 1.5). Results. We have determined distances, masses and physical sizes for 241 of the filamentary structures. We find a median distance of 3.8 kpc, a mean mass of a few 10{\textasciicircum}3 m\_sun, a mean length of {\textasciitilde}6pc and a mass-to-length ratio of (M/L) {\textasciitilde}200-2000M\_sun/ pc. We also find that these filamentary structures are tightly correlated with the spiral arms in longitude and velocity, and that their semi-major axis is preferentially aligned parallel to the Galactic mid-plane and therefore with the direction of large-scale Galactic magnetic field. We find many examples where the dense filaments identified in {ATLASGAL} are associated with larger scale filamentary structures ({\textasciitilde}100 pc), and argue that this is likely to be common, and as such these may indicate a connection between large-scale Galactic dynamics and star formation. Conclusions. We have produced a large and Galaxy-wide catalogue of dense filamentary structures that are representative of a particular size and mass range not previously well studied in the literature. Analyses of the properties and distribution of these filaments reveals that they are correlated with the spiral arms and make a significant contribution to star formation in the Galaxy. Massive star formation is ongoing within {\textasciitilde}20\% of the filaments and is strongly correlated with the filaments with the largest mass-to- length ratios. The luminosity of the embedded sources has a similar distribution to the Galactic-wide samples of young massive stars and can therefore be considered to be representative.},

	abstract = {The dynamical history of most merging galaxies is not well understood. Correlations between galaxy interaction and star formation have been found in previous studies, but require the context of the physical history of merging systems for full insight into the processes that lead to enhanced star formation. We present the results of simulations that reconstruct the orbit trajectories and disturbed morphologies of pairs of interacting galaxies. With the use of a restricted three-body simulation code and the help of Citizen Scientists, we sample 10{\textasciicircum}5 points in parameter space for each system. We demonstrate a successful recreation of the morphologies of 62 pairs of interacting galaxies through the review of more than 3 million simulations. We examine the level of convergence and uniqueness of the dynamical properties of each system. These simulations represent the largest collection of models of interacting galaxies to date, providing a valuable resource for the investigation of mergers. This paper presents the simulation parameters generated by the project. They are now publicly available in electronic format at http://data.galaxyzoo.org/mergers.html. Though our best-fit model parameters are not an exact match to previously published models, our method for determining uncertainty measurements will aid future comparisons between models. The dynamical clocks from our models agree with previous results of the time since the onset of star formation from star burst models in interacting systems and suggests that tidally induced star formation is triggered very soon after closest approach.},

Using the unprecedented volume and high resolution of the {BlueTides} cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we study the population of luminous rare objects at \$z {\textgreater} 10\$. The luminosity function in {BlueTides} implies an enhanced number of massive galaxies, consistent with the observation of {GN}-\$z11\$.

We define clouds either as regions above a density threshold n\_H,min = 10 cm{\textasciicircum}-3, or using an observationally motivated velocity-integrated {CO} line intensity threshold of 0.25 K km s{\textasciicircum}-1. Our simulations include a non-equilibrium treatment for the chemistry of 157 species, including 20 molecules. We use a suite of runs to carefully investigate the effects of numerical resolution and pressure floors (i.e. Jeans mass limiters). We find cloud lifetimes up to {\textasciitilde}40 Myr, with a median of 13 Myr, in agreement with observations. At ten per cent solar metallicity, young clouds ({\textless}10-15 Myr) tend to be underabundant in H2 and {CO} compared to chemical equilibrium, by factors of {\textasciitilde}3 and 1-2 orders of magnitude, respectively. At solar metallicity, {GMCs} reach chemical equilibrium faster (within {\textasciitilde}1 Myr), due to a higher formation rate of H2 on dust grains. We also compute {CO} J = 1-0 line emission from our simulated {GMCs} in post-processing. We find that the mean {CO} intensity, I\_CO, is strongly suppressed at low dust extinction, A\_v, and possibly saturates towards high A\_v, in agreement with observations. Our simulated I\_CO - A\_v relation shifts towards higher A\_v for higher metallicities and, to a lesser extent, for stronger {UV} radiation fields. At ten per cent solar metallicity, we find weaker {CO} emission in young clouds ({\textless}10-15 Myr), consistent with the underabundance of {CO} in such clouds. This is reflected in the median X\_CO factor, which decreases by an order of magnitude from 0 to 15 Myr, albeit with a large scatter.},

For the first time, we demonstrate that spiral arms, that form in a disc in a fully cosmological environment with realistic galaxy formation physics, drive large-scale systematic streaming motions. In particular, on the trailing edge of the spiral arms the peculiar galacto-centric radial and tangential velocity field is directed radially outward and tangentially backward, whereas it is radially inward and tangentially forward on the leading edge. Owing to the negative radial metallicity gradient, this systematic motion drives, at a given radius, an azimuthal variation in the residual metallicity that is characterised by a metal rich trailing edge and a metal poor leading edge. We show that these signatures are theoretically observable in external galaxies with Integral Field Unit instruments such as {VLT}/{MUSE}, and if detected, would provide evidence for large-scale systematic radial migration driven by spiral arms.},

We study these observational diagnostics of galaxy haloes for a suite of cosmological `zoom-in' simulations from the `Feedback In Realistic Environments' project, which spans a large range in halo mass 10{\textasciicircum}10-10{\textasciicircum}13 Msun). We explore the effect of stellar feedback on the hot gas observables. The properties of our simulated groups, such as baryon fractions, {SZ} flux, and X-ray luminosities (L\_X), are broadly consistent with existing observations, even though feedback from active galactic nuclei is not included. We make predictions for future observations of lower-mass objects for both {SZ} and diffuse X-ray measurements, finding that they are not just scaled-down versions of massive galaxies, but more strongly affected by galactic winds driven by star formation. Low-mass haloes ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun) retain a low fraction of their baryons, which results in a strong suppression of the {SZ} signal. Our simulations therefore predict a scaling with halo mass that is steeper than self-similar for haloes less massive than 10{\textasciicircum}13 Msun. For halo masses {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun, L\_X is time-variable and correlated primarily with the star formation rate ({SFR}). For these objects, the diffuse X-ray emission is powered mostly by galactic winds and the gas dominating the X-ray emission is flowing out with radial velocities close to the halo's circular velocity. For halo masses {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}13 Msun, on the other hand, L\_X is much less variable and not correlated with the {SFR}, because the emission originates from the quasi-hydrostatic, virialized halo gas.},

In this model, quenching is the dominant physical mechanism for introducing scatter in the growth histories of these galaxies. We find that present-day quiescent galaxies have a larger variety of growth histories than star-formers since they underwent 'staggered quenching' - a term describing the correlation between the time of quenching and present-day halo mass. While halo mass correlates broadly with quiescence, we find that quiescence is primarily a function of black hole mass, where galaxies quench when heating from their active galactic nuclei becomes sufficient to offset the redshift-dependent cooling rate. In this model, the emergence of a prominent quiescent population is the main process that flattens the stellar mass-halo mass relation at mass scales at or above that of the Milky Way.},

Wu et al.

The {MALT}90 data show that the Gao-Solomon relation in galaxies cannot be satisfactorily explained by the blending of large numbers of high-mass clumps in the telescope beam. Not only do the clumps have a large scatter in the \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{IR}\}\}\$/\$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{HCN}\}\}\$ ratio, but also far too many high-mass clumps are required to account for the Galactic {IR} and {HCN} luminosities. We suggest that the scatter in the \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{IR}\}\}\$/\$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{HCN}\}\}\$ ratio converges to the scatter of the Gao-Solomon relation at some size-scale \${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$1 kpc. We suggest that the Gao-Solomon relation could instead result from of a universal large-scale star formation efficiency, initial mass function, core mass function, and clump mass function.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08928},
	abstract = {The transit method is presently the most successful planet discovery and characterization tool at our disposal. Other advanced civilizations would surely be aware of this technique and appreciate that their home planet's existence and habitability is essentially broadcast to all stars lying along their ecliptic plane. We suggest that advanced civilizations could cloak their presence, or deliberately broadcast it, through controlled laser emission. Such emission could distort the apparent shape of their transit light curves with relatively little energy, due to the collimated beam and relatively infrequent nature of transits. We estimate that humanity could cloak the Earth from Kepler-like broadband surveys using an optical monochromatic laser array emitting a peak power of about 30 {MW} for roughly 10 hours per year. A chromatic cloak, effective at all wavelengths, is more challenging requiring a large array of tunable lasers with a total power of approximately 250 {MW}. Alternatively, a civilization could cloak only the atmospheric signatures associated with biological activity on their world, such as oxygen, which is achievable with a peak laser power of just around 160 {kW} per transit. Finally, we suggest that the time of transit for optical {SETI} is analogous to the water-hole in radio {SETI}, providing a clear window in which observers may expect to communicate. Accordingly, we propose that a civilization may deliberately broadcast their technological capabilities by distorting their transit to an artificial shape, which serves as both a {SETI} beacon and a medium for data transmission. Such signatures could be readily searched in the archival data of transit surveys.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08923},
	abstract = {Gravitational collapse of a massive primordial gas cloud is thought to be a promising path for the formation of supermassive blackholes in the early universe. We study conditions for the so-called direct collapse ({DC}) blackhole formation in a fully cosmological context. We combine a semi-analytic model of early galaxy formation with halo merger trees constructed from dark matter \$N\$-body simulations. We locate a total of 68 possible {DC} sites in a volume of \$20{\textbackslash};h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\$ on a side. We then perform hydrodynamics simulations for 42 selected halos to study in detail the evolution of the massive clouds within them. We find only two successful cases where the gas clouds rapidly collapse to form stars. In the other cases, gravitational collapse is prevented by the tidal force exerted by a nearby massive halo, which otherwise should serve as a radiation source necessary for {DC}. Ram pressure stripping disturbs the cloud approaching the source. In many cases, a {DC} halo and its nearby light source halo merge before the onset of cloud collapse. Only when the {DC} halo is assembled through major mergers, the gas density increases rapidly to trigger gravitational instability. Based on our cosmological simulations, we conclude that the event rate of {DC} is an order of magnitude smaller than reported in previous studies, although the absolute rate is still poorly constrained. It is necessary to follow the dynamical evolution of a {DC} cloud and its nearby halo(s) in order to determine the critical radiation flux for {DC}.},

The field equations arise from maximizing the density of states of matter plus geometry. The former is identified using the thermodynamics of null surfaces while the latter arises due to the existence of a zero-point length in the spacetime. The resulting field equations remain invariant when a constant is added to the matter Lagrangian, which is a symmetry of the matter sector. Therefore, the cosmological constant arises as an integration constant. A non-zero value \$({\textbackslash}Lambda)\$ of the cosmological constant renders the amount of cosmic information \$(I\_c)\$ accessible to an eternal observer finite and hence is directly related to it. This relation allows us to determine the numerical value of \$({\textbackslash}Lambda)\$ from the quantum structure of spacetime.},

	abstract = {The formation and evolution of galactic spiral arms is not yet clearly understood despite many analytic and numerical work. Recently, a new idea has been proposed that local density enhancements (waklets) arising in the galactic disk connect with each other and make global spiral arms. However, the understanding of this mechanism is not yet sufficient. We analyze the interaction of wakelets by using N-body simulations including perturbing point masses, which are heavier than individual N-body particles and act as the seeds for wakelets. Our simulation facilitates more straightforward interpretation of numerical results than previous work by putting a certain number of perturbers in a well-motivated configuration. We detected a clear sign of non-linear interaction between wakelets, which make global spiral arms by connecting two adjacent wakelets. We found that the wave number of the strongest non-linear interaction depends on galactic disk mass and shear rate. This dependence is consistent with the prediction of swing amplification mechanism and other previous results. Our results provide unification of previous results which seemed not consistent with each other.},

The sub-grid accretion model captures the key scalings governing angular momentum transport from galactic scales down to parsec scales, while our kinetic feedback implementation enables the injection of outflows with properties chosen to match observed nuclear outflows. We show that "quasar mode" feedback can have a large impact on the thermal properties of the intergalactic medium and the growth of galaxies and massive black holes for kinetic feedback efficiencies as low as 0.1\% relative to the bolometric luminosity. Nonetheless, our simulations suggest that the black hole-host scaling relations are only weakly dependent on the effects of black hole feedback on galactic scales, owing to feedback suppressing the growth of galaxies and massive black holes by a similar amount. In contrast, the rate at which gravitational torques feed the central black hole relative to the host galaxy star formation rate governs the slope and normalization of the black hole-host correlations. Our results suggest that a common gas supply regulated by gravitational torques is the primary driver of the observed co-evolution of black holes and galaxies.},

The {OVI} absorption in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) of isolated galaxies has been studied previously by the "Multiphase Galaxy Halos" survey, where the kinematics and absorption properties of the {CGM} have been investigated. We extend these studies to group environments. We define a galaxy group to have two or more galaxies having a line-of-sight velocity difference of no more than 1000 km/s and located within 350 kpc (projected) of a background quasar sightline. We identified a total of six galaxy groups associated with {OVI} absorption \$W\_\{{\textbackslash}rm r\}{\textgreater}0.06\$ \{{\textbackslash}{AA}\} that have a median redshift of \${\textbackslash}langle z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gal\} {\textbackslash}rangle = 0.1669\$ and a median impact parameter of \${\textbackslash}langle D {\textbackslash}rangle = 134.1\$ kpc. An additional 12 non-absorbing groups were identified with a median redshift of \${\textbackslash}langle z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gal\} {\textbackslash}rangle = 0.2690\$ and a median impact parameter of \${\textbackslash}langle D {\textbackslash}rangle = 274.0\$ kpc. We find the average equivalent width to be smaller for group galaxies than for isolated galaxies \$(3{\textbackslash}sigma)\$. However, the covering fractions are consistent with both samples. We used the pixel-velocity two-point correlation function method and find that the velocity spread of {OVI} in the {CGM} of group galaxies is significantly narrower than that of isolated galaxies \$(10{\textbackslash}sigma)\$. We suggest that the warm/hot {CGM} does not exist as a superposition of halos, instead, the virial temperature of the halo is hot enough for {OVI} to be further ionised. The remaining {OVI} likely exists at the interface between hot, diffuse gas and cooler regions of the {CGM}.},

	abstract = {Inferring model parameters from experimental data is a grand challenge in many sciences, including cosmology. This often relies critically on high fidelity numerical simulations, which are prohibitively computationally expensive. The application of deep learning techniques to generative modeling is renewing interest in using high dimensional density estimators as computationally inexpensive emulators of fully-fledged simulations. These generative models have the potential to make a dramatic shift in the field of scientific simulations, but for that shift to happen we need to study the performance of such generators in the precision regime needed for science applications. To this end, in this letter we apply Generative Adversarial Networks to the problem of generating cosmological weak lensing convergence maps. We show that our generator network produces maps that are described by, with high statistical confidence, the same summary statistics as the fully simulated maps.},

	abstract = {We have used the {AMR} hydrodynamic code, {MG}, to perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations with self-gravity of stellar feedback in a spherical clumpy molecular cloud formed through the action of thermal instability. We simulate the interaction of the mechanical energy input from 15 Msun, 40 Msun, 60 Msun and 120 Msun stars into a 100 pc-diameter 16,500 Msun cloud with a roughly spherical morphology with randomly distributed high density condensations. The stellar winds are introduced using appropriate non-rotating Geneva stellar evolution models. In the 15 Msun star case, the wind has very little effect, spreading around a few neighbouring clumps before becoming overwhelmed by the cloud collapse. In contrast, in the 40 Msun, 60 Msun and 120 Msun star cases, the more powerful stellar winds create large cavities and carve channels through the cloud, breaking out into the surrounding tenuous medium during the wind phase and considerably altering the cloud structure. After 4.97 Myrs, 3.97 Myrs and 3.01 Myrs respectively, the massive stars explode as supernovae ({SNe}). The wind-sculpted surroundings considerably affect the evolution of these {SN} events as they both escape the cloud along wind-carved channels and sweep up remaining clumps of cloud/wind material. The `cloud' as a coherent structure does not survive the {SN} from any of these stars, but only in the 120 Msun case is the cold molecular material completely destabilised and returned to the unstable thermal phase. In the 40 Msun and 60 Msun cases, coherent clumps of cold material are ejected from the cloud by the {SN}, potentially capable of further star formation.},

The fraction of systems showing high metallicity (i.e., \${\textbackslash}rm [Si/H]{\textgreater}-1.0\$) in our sample is significantly higher than the {HI}-selected sample (Wotta et al. 2016) and the galaxy-selected sample (Prochaska et al. 2017) of absorbers probing the circum-galactic medium ({CGM}) at similar redshift. A search for galaxies has revealed a significant galaxy-overdensity around these weak absorbers compared to random places with a median impact parameter of 166 kpc to the nearest galaxy. Moreover, we find the presence of multiple galaxies in \${\textbackslash}sim80\$\% of the cases, suggesting group environments. The observed \$d{\textbackslash}mathcal\{N\}/dz\$ of \$0.8{\textbackslash}pm0.2\$ indicates that such metal-enriched, compact, dense structures are ubiquitous in the halos of low-\$z\$ galaxies that are in groups.

Our sample ranges from compact, bulge-dominated systems with 90\% of their stellar mass within 2.5 kpc to well-ordered disks that reach \${\textbackslash}gtrsim15\$ kpc. The gas in our galaxies always forms a thin, rotation-supported disk at \$z=0\$, with sizes primarily determined by the gas mass. For stars, we quantify kinematics and morphology both via the fraction of stars on disk-like orbits and with the radial extent of the stellar disk. In this mass range, stellar morphology and kinematics are poorly correlated with the properties of the halo available from dark matter-only simulations (halo merger history, spin, or formation time). They more strongly correlate with the gaseous histories of the galaxies: those that maintain a high gas mass in the disk after \$z{\textbackslash}sim1\$ develop well-ordered stellar disks. The best predictor of morphology we identify is the spin of the gas in the halo at the time the galaxy formed 1/2 of its stars (i.e. the gas that builds the galaxy). High-\$z\$ mergers, before a hot halo emerges, produce some of the most massive bulges in the sample (from compact disks in gas-rich mergers), while later-forming bulges typically originate from internal processes, as satellites are stripped of gas before the galaxies merge. Moreover, most stars in \$z=0\$ {MW}-mass galaxies (even \$z=0\$ bulge stars) form in a disk: \${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$60-90\% of stars begin their lives rotationally supported.},

	abstract = {The gas surrounding galaxies outside their disks or interstellar medium and inside their virial radii is known as the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}). In recent years this component of galaxies has assumed an important role in our understanding of galaxy evolution owing to rapid advances in observational access to this diffuse, nearly invisible material. Observations and simulations of this component of galaxies suggest that it is a multiphase medium characterized by rich dynamics and complex ionization states. The {CGM} is a source for a galaxy's star-forming fuel, the venue for galactic feedback and recycling, and perhaps the key regulator of the galactic gas supply. We review our evolving knowledge of the {CGM} with emphasis on its mass, dynamical state, and coevolution with galaxies. Observations from all redshifts and from across the electromagnetic spectrum indicate that {CGM} gas has a key role in galaxy evolution. We summarize the state of this field and pose unanswered questions for future research.},

The simulations of z{\textasciitilde}0.2 L* (M\_200=10{\textasciicircum}11.7-10{\textasciicircum}12.3 Msol) haloes hosting star-forming galaxies and group-sized (M\_200=10{\textasciicircum}12.7-10{\textasciicircum}13.3 Msol) haloes hosting mainly passive galaxies reproduce key trends observed by the {COS}-Halos survey-- low ion column densities show 1) little dependence on galaxy specific star formation rate, 2) a patchy covering fraction indicative of 10{\textasciicircum}4 K clouds with a small volume filling factor, and 3) a declining covering fraction as impact parameter increases from 20-160 kpc. Simulated Si {II}, Si {III}, Si {IV}, C {II}, and C {III} column densities show good agreement with observations, while Mg {II} is under-predicted. Low ions trace a significant metal reservoir, {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8 Msol, residing primarily at 10-100 kpc from star-forming and passive central galaxies. These clouds tend to flow inwards and most will accrete onto the central galaxy within the next several Gyr, while a small fraction are entrained in strong outflows. A two-phase structure describes the inner {CGM} ({\textless}0.5 R\_200) with low-ion metal clouds surrounded by a hot, ambient medium. This cool phase is separate from the O {VI} observed by {COS}-Halos, which arises from the outer {CGM} ({\textgreater}0.5 R\_200) tracing virial temperature gas around L* galaxies. Physical parameters derived from standard photo-ionization modelling of observed column densities (e.g. aligned Si {II}/Si {III} absorbers) are validated against our simulations. Our simulations therefore support previous ionization models indicating that cloud covering factors decline while densities and pressures show little variation with increasing impact parameter.},

	abstract = {The pairwise kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ({kSZ}) signal from galaxy clusters is a probe of their line-of-sight momenta, and thus a potentially valuable source of cosmological information. In addition to the momenta, the amplitude of the measured signal depends on the properties of the intra-cluster gas and observational limitations such as errors in determining cluster centers and redshifts. In this work we simulate the pairwise {kSZ} signal of clusters at z{\textless}1, using the output from a cosmological N-body simulation and including the properties of the intra-cluster gas via a model that can be varied in post-processing. We find that modifications to the gas profile due to star formation and feedback reduce the pairwise {kSZ} amplitude of clusters by {\textasciitilde}50\%, relative to the naive 'gas traces mass' assumption. We demonstrate that mis-centering can reduce the overall amplitude of the pairwise {kSZ} signal by up to 10\%, while redshift errors can lead to an almost complete suppression of the signal at small separations. We confirm that a high-significance detection is expected from the combination of data from current-generation, high-resolution {CMB} experiments, such as the South Pole Telescope, and cluster samples from optical photometric surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey. Furthermore, we forecast that future experiments such as Advanced {ACTPol} in conjunction with data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument will yield detection significances of at least 20\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}, and up to 57\{{\textbackslash}sigma\} in an optimistic scenario.

	abstract = {The power spectrum of density fluctuations is a foundational source of cosmological information. Precision cosmological probes targeted primarily at investigations of dark energy require accurate theoretical determinations of the power spectrum in the nonlinear regime. To exploit the observational power of future cosmological surveys, accuracy demands on the theory are at the one percent level or better. Numerical simulations are currently the only way to produce sufficiently error-controlled predictions for the power spectrum. The very high computational cost of (precision) N-body simulations is a major obstacle to obtaining predictions in the nonlinear regime, while scanning over cosmological parameters. Near-future observations, however, are likely to provide a meaningful constraint only on constant dark energy equation of state '{wCDM}' cosmologies. In this paper we demonstrate that a limited set of only 37 cosmological models -- the "Coyote Universe" suite -- can be used to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum at the required accuracy over a prior parameter range set by cosmic microwave background observations. This paper is the second in a series of three, with the final aim to provide a high-accuracy prediction scheme for the nonlinear matter power spectrum for {wCDM} cosmologies.},

	abstract = {We present a formulation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) that utilizes a first-order consistent reproducing kernel, a smoothing function that exactly interpolates linear fields with particle tracers. Previous formulations using reproducing kernel ({RK}) interpolation have had difficulties maintaining conservation of momentum due to the fact the {RK} kernels are not, in general, spatially symmetric. Here, we utilize a reformulation of the fluid equations such that mass, linear momentum, and energy are all rigorously conserved without any assumption about kernel symmetries, while additionally maintaining approximate angular momentum conservation. Our approach starts from a rigorously consistent interpolation theory, where we derive the evolution equations to enforce the appropriate conservation properties, at the sacrifice of full consistency in the momentum equation. Additionally, by exploiting the increased accuracy of the {RK} method's gradient, we formulate a simple limiter for the artificial viscosity that reduces the excess diffusion normally incurred by the ordinary {SPH} artificial viscosity. Collectively, we call our suite of modifications to the traditional {SPH} scheme Conservative Reproducing Kernel {SPH}, or {CRKSPH}. {CRKSPH} retains many benefits of traditional {SPH} methods (such as preserving Galilean invariance and manifest conservation of mass, momentum, and energy) while improving on many of the shortcomings of {SPH}, particularly the overly aggressive artificial viscosity and zeroth-order inaccuracy. We compare {CRKSPH} to two different modern {SPH} formulations (pressure based {SPH} and compatibly differenced {SPH}), demonstrating the advantages of our new formulation when modeling fluid mixing, strong shock, and adiabatic phenomena.},

Large-scale simulations of structure formation in the Universe play a critical role in the interpretation of the data and extraction of the physics of interest. Just as survey instruments continue to grow in size and complexity, so do the supercomputers that enable these simulations. Here we report on {HACC} (Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code), a recently developed and evolving cosmology N-body code framework, designed to run efficiently on diverse computing architectures and to scale to millions of cores and beyond. {HACC} can run on all current supercomputer architectures and supports a variety of programming models and algorithms. It has been demonstrated at scale on Cell- and {GPU}-accelerated systems, standard multi-core node clusters, and Blue Gene systems. {HACC}'s design allows for ease of portability, and at the same time, high levels of sustained performance on the fastest supercomputers available. We present a description of the design philosophy of {HACC}, the underlying algorithms and code structure, and outline implementation details for several specific architectures.

	abstract = {We analyse cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include theoretically and observationally motivated prescriptions for galactic outflows. If these simulated winds accurately represent winds in the real Universe, then material previously ejected in winds provides the dominant source of gas infall for new star formation at redshifts z {\textless} 1. This recycled wind accretion, or wind mode, provides a third physically distinct accretion channel in addition to the `hot' and `cold' modes emphasized in recent theoretical studies. The recycling time of wind material (trec) is shorter in higher mass systems owing to the interaction between outflows and the increasingly higher gas densities in and around higher mass haloes. This differential recycling plays a central role in shaping the present-day galaxy stellar mass function ({GSMF}), because declining trec leads to increasing wind mode galaxy growth in more massive haloes. For the three feedback models explored, the wind mode dominates above a threshold mass that primarily depends on wind velocity; the shape of the {GSMF} therefore can be directly traced back to the feedback prescription used. If we remove all particles that were ever ejected in a wind, then the predicted {GSMFs} are much steeper than observed. In this case, galaxy masses are suppressed both by the ejection of gas from galaxies and by the hydrodynamic heating of their surroundings, which reduces subsequent infall. With wind recycling included, the simulation that incorporates our favoured momentum-driven wind scalings reproduces the observed {GSMF} for stellar masses 109Msolar {\textless}= M {\textless}= 5 × 1010Msolar. At higher masses, wind recycling leads to excessive galaxy masses and star formation rates relative to observations. In these massive systems, some quenching mechanism must suppress not only the direct accretion from the primordial intergalactic medium but the re-accretion of gas ejected from star-forming galaxies. In short, as has long been anticipated, the form of the {GSMF} is governed by outflows; the unexpected twist here for our simulated winds is that it is not primarily the ejection of material but how the ejected material is re-accreted that governs the {GSMF}.},

	abstract = {We use hydrodynamic simulations to examine how the baryonic components of galaxies are assembled, focusing on the relative importance of mergers and smooth accretion in the formation of similar {toL}(*) systems. In our primary simulation, which models a (50 h(-1) Mpc)(3) comoving volume of a Lambda-dominated cold dark matter universe, the space density of objects at our (64 particle) baryon mass resolution threshold M-c = 5.4 x 10(10) M-. corresponds to that of observed galaxies with L similar to L-*/4. Galaxies above this threshold gain most of their mass by accretion rather than by mergers. At the redshift of peak mass growth, zapproximate to2, accretion dominates over merging by about 4 : 1. The mean accretion rate per galaxy declines from similar to40 M-. yr(-1) at z = 2 to similar to10 M-. yr(-1) at z = 0, while the merging rate peaks later (z approximate to 1) and declines more slowly, so by z = 0 the ratio is about 2 : 1. We cannot distinguish truly smooth accretion from merging with objects below our mass resolution threshold, but extrapolating our measured mass spectrum of merging objects, {dP}/{dM} proportional to M-alpha with alpha similar to 1, implies that subresolution mergers would add relatively little mass. The global star formation history in these simulations tracks the mass accretion rate rather than the merger rate. At low redshift, destruction of galaxies by mergers is approximately balanced by the growth of new systems, so the comoving space density of resolved galaxies stays nearly constant despite significant mass evolution at the galaxy-by-galaxy level. The predicted merger rate at z less than or similar to 1 agrees with recent estimates from close pairs in the Canada-France Redshift Survey and Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Redshift Survey.},

	abstract = {Using high-resolution simulations with explicit treatment of stellar feedback physics based on the {FIRE} (Feedback in Realistic Environments) project, we study how galaxy formation and the interstellar medium ({ISM}) are affected by magnetic fields, anisotropic Spitzer-Braginskii conduction and viscosity, and sub-grid metal diffusion from unresolved turbulence. We consider controlled simulations of isolated (non-cosmological) galaxies but also a limited set of cosmological "zoom-in" simulations. Although simulations have shown significant effects from these physics with weak or absent stellar feedback, the effects are much weaker than those of stellar feedback when the latter is modeled explicitly. The additional physics have no systematic effect on galactic star formation rates ({SFRs}) . In contrast, removing stellar feedback leads to {SFRs} being over-predicted by factors of \${\textbackslash}sim 10 -100\$. Without feedback, neither galactic winds nor volume filling hot-phase gas exist, and discs tend to runaway collapse to ultra-thin scale-heights with unphysically dense clumps congregating at the galactic center. With stellar feedback, a multi-phase, turbulent medium with galactic fountains and winds is established. At currently achievable resolutions and for the investigated halo mass range \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, the additional physics investigated here ({MHD}, conduction, viscosity, metal diffusion) have only weak (\${\textbackslash}sim10{\textbackslash}\%\$-level) effects on regulating {SFR} and altering the balance of phases, outflows, or the energy in {ISM} turbulence, consistent with simple equipartition arguments. We conclude that galactic star formation and the {ISM} are primarily governed by a combination of turbulence, gravitational instabilities, and feedback.

Using Omega25, a suite of cosmological simulations that incorporate both dark matter and gas dynamics with differing treatments of gas cooling, star formation, and thermal feedback, we systematically explore the physics that governs cosmic accretion into halos and their galaxies. Physically meaningful cosmic accretion of both dark matter and baryons occurs at z 1  across our halo mass range: M M 10 200m 11 14 = - . However, dark matter, because it is dissipationless, is deposited (in a time-average sense) at R z () 200m  in a shell-like manner, such that dark matter mass and density experience little-to-no physical growth at any radius within a halo at z 1 {\textless} . In contrast, gas, because it is able to cool radiatively, experiences significant accretion at all radii, at a rate that roughly tracks the accretion rate at R 200m , at all redshifts. Infalling gas starts to decouple from dark matter at R 2 200m » and continues to accrete to smaller radii until the onset of strong angular-momentum support at R 0.1 200m » . Thus, while the growth of dark matter is subject to pseudo-evolution, the growth of baryons is not. The fact that the accretion rate of gas on galactic scales tracks the accretion rate near R 200m provides insight into the tight relations between the masses/sizes of galaxies and those of their host halos across cosmic time.},

	abstract = {Gas metallicity is a key quantity used to determine the physical conditions of gaseous clouds in a wide range of astronomical environments, including interstellar and intergalactic space. In particular, considerable effort in circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) studies focuses on metallicity measurements, because gas metallicity serves as a critical discriminator for whether the observed heavy ions in the {CGM} originate in chemically-enriched outflows or in more chemically-pristine gas accreted from the intergalactic medium. However, because the gas is ionized, a necessary first step in determining {CGM} metallicity is to constrain the ionization state of the gas which, in addition to gas density, depends on the ultraviolet background radiation field ({UVB}). While it is generally acknowledged that both the intensity and spectral slope of the {UVB} are uncertain, the impact of an uncertain spectral slope has not been properly addressed in the literature. This Letter shows that adopting a different spectral slope can result in an order of magnitude difference in the inferred {CGM} metallicity. Specifically, a harder {UVB} spectrum leads to a higher estimated gas metallicity for a given set of observed ionic column densities . Therefore, such systematic uncertainties must be folded into the error budget for metallicity estimates of ionized gas. An initial study shows that empirical diagnostics are available for discriminating between hard and soft ionizing spectra. Applying these diagnostics helps reduce the systematic uncertainties in {CGM} metallicity estimates.},

	abstract = {The Feedback In Realistic Environments ({FIRE}) project explores the role of feedback in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Previous {FIRE} simulations used an identical source code ({FIRE}-1) for consistency. Now, motivated by the development of more accurate numerics (hydrodynamic solvers, gravitational softening, supernova coupling) and the exploration of new physics (e.g. magnetic fields), we introduce {FIRE}-2, an updated numerical implementation of {FIRE} physics for the {GIZMO} code. We run a suite of simulations and show {FIRE}-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties relative to {FIRE}-1. We then pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics in galaxy simulations. Details of the star-formation ({SF}) algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects, provided that we include metal-line cooling and {SF} occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present several new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are remarkably robust to the numerics that we test, provided that: (1) Toomre masses (cold disk scale heights) are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation and isotropy, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. As resolution increases, stellar masses and profiles converge first, followed by metal abundances and visual morphologies, then properties of winds and the circumgalactic medium. The central ({\textasciitilde}kpc) mass concentration of massive (L*) galaxies is sensitive to numerics, particularly how winds ejected into hot halos are trapped, mixed, and recycled into the galaxy. Multiple feedback mechanisms are required to reproduce observations: {SNe} regulate stellar masses; {OB}/{AGB} mass loss fuels late-time {SF}; radiative feedback suppresses instantaneous {SFRs} and accretion onto dwarfs. We provide tables, initial conditions, and the numerical algorithms required to reproduce our simulations.},

This survey consists of "targeted" and "serendipitous" {CGM} subsamples, originally described in Stocke et al. (2013, Paper 1). The targeted subsample probes low-luminosity, late-type galaxies at \$z{\textless}0.02\$ with small impact parameters (\${\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}rho{\textbackslash}rangle = 71\$ kpc), and the serendipitous subsample probes higher luminosity galaxies at \$z{\textbackslash}lesssim0.2\$ with larger impact parameters (\${\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}rho{\textbackslash}rangle = 222\$ kpc). {HST} and {FUSE} {UV} spectroscopy of the absorbers and basic data for the associated galaxies, derived from ground-based imaging and spectroscopy, are presented. We find broad agreement with the {COS}-Halos results, but our sample shows no evidence for changing ionization parameter or hydrogen density with distance from the {CGM} host galaxy, probably because the {COS}-Halos survey probes the {CGM} at smaller impact parameters. We find at least two passive galaxies with H I and metal-line absorption, confirming the intriguing {COS}-Halos result that galaxies sometimes have cool gas halos despite no on-going star formation. Using a new methodology for fitting H I absorption complexes, we confirm the {CGM} cool gas mass of Paper 1, but this value is significantly smaller than found by the {COS}-Halos survey. We trace much of this difference to the specific values of the low-\$z\$ meta-galactic ionization rate assumed. After accounting for this difference, a best-value for the {CGM} cool gas mass is found by combining the results of both surveys to obtain \${\textbackslash}log\{(M/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\})\}=10.5{\textbackslash}pm0.3\$, or {\textasciitilde}30\% of the total baryon reservoir of an \$L {\textbackslash}geq L{\textasciicircum}*\$, star-forming galaxy.},

	abstract = {The distribution of metals in the intracluster medium ({ICM}) of galaxy clusters provides valuable information on their formation and evolution, on the connection with the cosmic star formation and on the effects of different gas processes. By analyzing a sample of simulated galaxy clusters, we study the chemical enrichment of the {ICM}, its evolution, and its relation with the physical processes included in the simulation and with the thermal properties of the core. These simulations, consisting of re-simulations of 29 Lagrangian regions performed with an upgraded version of the {SPH} {GADGET}-3 code, have been run including two different sets of baryonic physics: one accounts for radiative cooling, star formation, metal enrichment and supernova ({SN}) feedback, and the other one further includes the effects of feedback from active galactic nuclei ({AGN}). In agreement with observations, we find an anti-correlation between entropy and metallicity in cluster cores, and similar radial distributions of heavy-element abundances and abundance ratios out to large cluster-centric distances ({\textasciitilde}R180). In the outskirts, namely outside of {\textasciitilde}0.2R180, we find a remarkably homogeneous metallicity distribution, with almost flat profiles of the elements produced by either {SNIa} or {SNII}. We investigated the origin of this phenomenon and discovered that it is due to the widespread displacement of metal-rich gas by early (z{\textgreater}2-3) {AGN} powerful bursts, acting on small high-redshift haloes. Our results also indicate that the intrinsic metallicity of the hot gas for this sample is on average consistent with no evolution between z=2 and z=0, across the entire radial range.},

The molecular gas depletion time, defined as the ratio of molecular gas mass to star formation rate, scales as (1+z){\textasciicircum}(-0.57)x(\{{\textbackslash}delta\}{MS}){\textasciicircum}(-0.44), and is only weakly dependent on stellar mass and galaxy rest-frame optical size. The ratio of molecular-to-stellar mass depends on (1+z){\textasciicircum}2.8 x(\{{\textbackslash}delta\}{MS}){\textasciicircum}0.54 x(M*){\textasciicircum}-0.34, which tracks the evolution of the specific star formation rate.

	abstract = {Winds arising from galaxies, star clusters, and active galactic nuclei are crucial players in star and galaxy formation, but it has proven remarkably difficult to use observations of them to determine physical properties of interest, particularly mass fluxes. Much of the difficulty stems from a lack of a theory that links a physically-realistic model for winds' density, velocity, and covering factors to calculations of light emission and absorption. In this paper we provide such a model. We consider a wind launched from a turbulent region with a range of column densities, derive the differential acceleration of gas as a function of column density, and use this result to compute winds' absorption profiles, emission profiles, and emission intensity maps in both optically thin and optically thick species. The model is sufficiently simple that all required computations can be done analytically up to straightforward numerical integrals, rendering it suitable for the problem of deriving physical parameters by fitting models to observed data. We show that our model produces realistic absorption and emission profiles for some example cases, and argue that the most promising methods of deducing mass fluxes are based on combinations of absorption lines of different optical depths, or on combining absorption with measurements of molecular line emission. In the second paper in this series, we expand on these ideas by introducing a set of observational diagnostics that are significantly more robust that those commonly in use, and that can be used to obtain improved estimates of wind properties.},

Exploiting our sample homogeneously selected over the large area, we derive the number densities of blobs at each epoch. The number densities of blobs decrease drastically with redshifts at the rate that is larger than that of the decrease of cosmic star formation densities.},

A kinetic equation for the distribution function of gas particles in the phase space is derived from a concept of statistical equipartition of the virial among subsystems. Its solution, an analog of the Maxwell-Boltzmann weight, is found in the limit of thick "gravitational haziness" (the high-temperature expansion) where the gravitational potential follows the Lane-Emden equation. A more general equation for arbitrary "gravitational haziness" is conjectured as a special property of the kinetic equation. The first law of a "hazydynamics" (thermodynamics) states that the total mass of an astronomical stellar collection is the sum of the Archimedes displaced mass and an excess "gobbled" mass determined by the "gravitational haziness" and history.},

	abstract = {We present the results of smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations investigating the evolution and fragmentation of filaments that are accreting from a turbulent medium. We show that the presence of turbulence, and the resulting inhomogeneities in the accretion flow, play a significant role in the fragmentation process. Filaments which experience a weakly turbulent accretion flow fragment in a two-tier hierarchical fashion, similar to the fragmentation pattern seen in the Orion Integral Shaped Filament. Increasing the energy in the turbulent velocity field results in more sub-structure within the filaments, and one sees a shift from gravity-dominated fragmentation to turbulence-dominated fragmentation. The sub-structure formed in the filaments is elongated and roughly parallel to the longitudinal axis of the filament, similar to the fibres seen in observations of Taurus, and suggests that the fray and fragment scenario is a possible mechanism for the production of fibres. We show that the formation of these fibre-like structures is linked to the vorticity of the velocity field inside the filament and the filament's accretion from an inhomogeneous medium. Moreover, we find that accretion is able to drive and sustain roughly sonic levels of turbulence inside the filaments, but is not able to prevent radial collapse once the filaments become supercritical. However, the supercritical filaments which contain fibre-like structures do not collapse radially, suggesting that fibrous filaments may not necessarily become radially unstable once they reach the critical line-density.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04509},
	abstract = {Star formation from the interstellar medium of galactic disks is a basic process controlling the evolution of galaxies. Understanding the star formation rate in a local patch of a disk with a given gas mass is thus an important challenge for theoretical models. Here we simulate a kiloparsec region of a disk, following the evolution of self-gravitating molecular clouds down to subparsec scales, as they form stars that then inject feedback energy by dissociating and ionizing {UV} photons and supernova explosions. We assess the relative importance of each feedback mechanism. We find that \${\textbackslash}rm H\_2\$-dissociating feedback results in the largest absolute reduction in star formation compared to the run with no feedback. Subsequently adding photoionization feedback produces a more modest reduction. Our fiducial models that combine all three feedback mechanisms yield, without fine-tuning, star formation rates that are in excellent agreement with observations, with \${\textbackslash}rm H\_2\$-dissociating photons playing a crucial role. Models that only include supernova feedback---a common method in galaxy evolution simulations---settle to similar star formation rates, but with very different temperature and chemical states of the gas, and with very different spatial distributions of young stars.},

	abstract = {Galactic outflows are believed to play an important role in regulating star formation in galaxies, but estimates of the outflowing mass and momentum have historically been based on uncertain assumptions. Here, we measure the mass, momentum, and energy outflow rates of seven nearby star-forming galaxies using ultraviolet absorption lines and observationally motivated estimates for the density, metallicity, and radius of the outflow. Low-mass galaxies generate outflows faster than their escape velocities with mass outflow rates up to twenty times larger than their star formation rates. These outflows from low-mass galaxies also have momenta larger than provided from supernovae alone, indicating that multiple momentum sources drive these outflows. Only 1-20{\textbackslash}\% of the supernovae energy is converted into kinetic energy, and this fraction decreases with increasing stellar mass such that low-mass galaxies drive more efficient outflows. We find scaling relations between the outflows and the stellar mass of their host galaxies (M\$\_{\textbackslash}ast\$) at the 2-3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance level. The mass-loading factor, or the mass outflow rate divided by the star formation rate, scales as M\$\_{\textbackslash}ast{\textasciicircum}\{-0.4\}\$ and with the circular velocity as v\$\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{circ\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1.6\}\$. The scaling of the mass-loading factor is similar to recent simulations, but the observations are a factor of five smaller, possibly indicating that there is a substantial amount of unprobed gas in a different ionization phase. The outflow momenta are consistent with a model where star formation drives the outflow while gravity counteracts this acceleration.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed dramatic progress in our understanding of how turbulence arises and transports angular momentum in astrophysical accretion disks. The key conceptual point has its origins in work dating from the 1950s, but its implications have been fully understood only in the last several years: the combination of a subthermal magnetic field (any nonpathological configuration will do) and outwardly decreasing differential rotation rapidly generates magnetohydrodynamic ({MHD}) turbulence via a remarkably simple linear instability. The result is a greatly enhanced effective viscosity, the origin of which had been a long-standing problem. The {MHD} nature of disk turbulence has linked two broad domains of magnetized fluid research: accretion theory and dynamos. The understanding that weak magnetic fields are not merely passively acted upon by turbulence, but actively generate it, means that the assumptions of classical dynamo theory break down in disks. Paralleling the new conceptual understanding has been the development of powerful numerical {MHD} codes. These have taught us that disks truly are turbulent, transporting angular momentum at greatly enhanced rates. We have also learned, however, that not all forms of disk turbulence do this. Purely hydrodynamic turbulence, when it is imposed, simply causes fluctuations without a significant increase in transport. The interplay between numerical simulation and analytic arguments has been particularly fruitful in accretion disk theory and is a major focus of this article. The authors conclude with a summary of what is now known of disk turbulence and mention some knotty outstanding questions (e.g., what is the physics behind nonlinear field saturation?) for which we may soon begin to develop answers.},

	abstract = {We simulate incompressible {MHD} turbulence in the presence of a strong background magnetic field. Our major conclusions are: 1) {MHD} turbulence is most conveniently described in terms of counter propagating shear Alfven and slow waves. Shear Alfven waves control the cascade dynamics. Slow waves play a passive role and adopt the spectrum set by the shear Alfven waves, as does a passive scalar. 2) {MHD} turbulence is anisotropic with energy cascading more rapidly along k\_perp than along k\_parallel, where k\_perp and k\_parallel refer to wavevector components perpendicular and parallel to the local magnetic field. Anisotropy increases with increasing k\_perp. 3) {MHD} turbulence is generically strong in the sense that the waves which comprise it suffer order unity distortions on timescales comparable to their periods. Nevertheless, turbulent fluctuations are small deep inside the inertial range compared to the background field. 4) Decaying {MHD} turbulence is unstable to an increase of the imbalance between the flux of waves propagating in opposite directions along the magnetic field. 5) Items 1-4 lend support to the model of strong {MHD} turbulence by Goldreich \& Sridhar ({GS}). Results from our simulations are also consistent with the {GS} prediction gamma=2/3. The sole notable discrepancy is that 1D power law spectra, E(k\_perp) {\textasciitilde} k\_perp{\textasciicircum}\{-alpha\}, determined from our simulations exhibit alpha {\textasciitilde} 3/2, whereas the {GS} model predicts alpha = 5/3.},

The principle results are: (1) the {CGM} of field L* galaxies exhibits a declining {HI} surface density with impact parameter Rperp (at {\textgreater}99.5\%\$ confidence), (2) the transmission of ionizing radiation through {CGM} gas alone is 70+/-7\%; (3) the metallicity distribution function of the cool {CGM} is unimodal with a median of 1/3 Z\_Sun and a 95\% interval from {\textasciitilde}1/50 Z\_Sun to over 3x solar. The incidence of metal poor ({\textless}1/100 Z\_Sun) gas is low, implying any such gas discovered along quasar sightlines is typically unrelated to L* galaxies; (4) we find an unexpected increase in gas metallicity with declining {NHI} (at {\textgreater}99.9\% confidence) and, therefore, also with increasing Rperp. The high metallicity at large radii implies early enrichment; (5) A non-parametric estimate of the cool {CGM} gas mass is M\_CGM\_cool = 9.2 +/- 4.3 10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun, which together with new mass estimates for the hot {CGM} may resolve the galactic missing baryons problem.

The upper bound on the heat flux which may be carried by electrons is found to be smaller than previously expected, it is assumed that the exact heat flux should closely approximate this maximum value in collisionless gases, and such a theory is shown to give good numerical agreement with solar-wind observations. A straightforward solution is obtained for those cases where the classical thermal-conduction formula is applicable throughout the interface, and limitations are given under which analytic solutions can be found when the classical formula does not apply throughout the interface. The results of the present theory are compared with those of a previous and less accurate analysis which considered conducting fronts analogous to ionization fronts.

The research combined qualitative and quantitative methods and involved various research tools, which were implemented in order to collect the data concerning the students’ knowledge and understanding before, during, and following the learning process. The findings indicated that the development of system thinking in the context of the earth systems consists of several sequential stages arranged in a hierarchical structure. The cognitive skills that are developed in each stage serve as the basis for the development of the next higher-order thinking skills. The research showed that in spite of the minimal initial system thinking abilities of the students most of them made some meaningful progress in their system thinking skills, and a third of them reached the highest level of system thinking in the context of the hydro cycle. Two main factors were found to be the source of the differential progress of the students: (a) the students’ individual cognitive abilities, and (b) their level of involvement in the knowledge integration activities during their inquiry-based learning both indoors and outdoors.},

The Si {IV} detection indicates an enriched, disk-wide, ionized gas inflow toward the disk. This inflow is most likely multi-phase as the redshifted components can also be observed in ions with lower ionization states (e.g., S {II}, P {II}, Fe {II}, Si {II}). Kinematic modeling of the inflow is consistent with an accreting layer at the disk-halo interface of M33, which has an accretion velocity of 110\${\textasciicircum}\{+15\}\_\{-20\}\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at a distance of 1.5\${\textasciicircum}\{+1.0\}\_\{-1.0\}\$ kiloparsec above the disk.

The high accretion rate and the level of metal-enrichment suggest the inflow is likely to be the fall back of M33 gas from a galactic fountain and/or the gas pulled loosed during a close interaction between M31 and M33.

To study the survival of relatively cool gas (T {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}5 K) in the {CGM}, we performed a set of hydrodynamical simulations of cool (T = 10{\textasciicircum}4 K) neutral gas clouds travelling through a hot (T = 2x10{\textasciicircum}6 K) and low-density (n = 10{\textasciicircum}-4 cm{\textasciicircum}-3) coronal medium, typical of Milky Way-like galaxies at large galactocentric distances ({\textasciitilde} 50-150 kpc). We explored the effects of different values of relative velocity and radius of the clouds. Our simulations include radiative cooling, photoionization heating and thermal conduction. The main result is that large clouds (radii larger than 250 pc) may survive for very long time (at least 250 Myr): their mass decreases during their trajectory but at very low rates. We found that thermal conduction plays a significant role: its effect is to prevent formation of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the cloud-corona interface, keeping the cloud compact and therefore more difficult to destroy. The distribution of column densities in our simulations are compatible with those observed for low-temperature ions (e.g. {SiII} and {SiIII}) and for high-ions ({OVI}) once we take into account that {OVI} covers much more extended regions than the cool gas and, therefore, it is more likely to be detected along a generic line of sight.},

Dust, on the other hand, has little effect on the outflow evolution, and is rapidly destroyed in all the simulations except the case with the smallest mass flux. I use the results to construct a simple steady-state model of the observed {UV}/optical emission from each outflow. The velocity profiles in this case are dominated by geometric effects, and the overall luminosities are extremely strong functions of the properties of the host system, as observed in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies ({ULIRGs}). Furthermore the luminosities and maximum velocities in several models are consistent with emission-line observations of {ULIRGs}, although the velocities are significantly greater than observed in absorption-line studies. It may be that absorption line observations of galaxy outflows probe entrained cold material at small radii, while emission-line observations probe cold material condensing from the initially hot medium at larger distances.},

We find hints that at high redshift (\$z{\textbackslash}sim 2\$--3), {SRHR}\${\textbackslash}lambda\$ is lower for more massive galaxies, while it shows no significant dependence on stellar mass at \$z{\textbackslash}lesssim 0.5\$.

This survey examines 432 {VLT}/{UVES} spectra from the {UVES} {SQUAD} collaboration and 170 Keck/{HIRES} spectra from the {KODIAQ} group, allowing for detections of intervening \$\{{\textbackslash}{MgII}\}\$ absorbers spanning redshifts \$0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.6\$. We employ an accurate, automated approach to line detection which consistently detects redshifted absorption lines. We measure the equivalent widths, apparent optical depth column densities, and velocity widths for each absorbing system. Using our complete sample of all detectable \$\{{\textbackslash}{MgII}\}\$ absorbers, we can accurately determine the redshift path density of absorbers across cosmic time. We measure evolution in the comoving \$\{{\textbackslash}{MgII}\}\$ line density, \${dN}{\textbackslash},/{dX}\$, finding more high equivalent width absorbers at \$z = 2\$ than at present. We also measure evolution in the equivalent width distribution, parameterized by a Schechter function fit, finding a shallower weak-end slope for absorbers at redshifts between \$1.53 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.64\$ as compared to lower redshifts. Finally, we calculate the cosmic mass fraction of \$\{{\textbackslash}{MgII}\}\$ using the column density distribution. We find that weak \$\{{\textbackslash}{MgII}\}\$ absorbers, those with equivalent widths less than \$0.3\${\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}{AA}\}, are physically distinct and evolve separately from very strong \$\{{\textbackslash}{MgII}\}\$ absorbers, which have equivalent widths greater than \$1.0\${\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}{AA}\}.},

The results provide a detailed test of the modeling of stellar structure and evolution, and hence of the physical properties of matter assumed in the models.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02829},
	abstract = {We present final statistics from a survey for intervening {MgII} absorption towards 100 quasars with emission redshifts between \$z=3.55\$ and \$z=7.08\$. Using infrared spectra from Magellan/{FIRE}, we detect 279 cosmological {MgII} absorbers, and confirm that the incidence rate of \$W\_r{\textgreater}0.3 {\textbackslash}{AA}\$ {MgII} absorption per comoving path length does not evolve measurably between \$z=0.25\$ and \$z=7\$. This is consistent with our detection of seven new {MgII} systems at \$z{\textgreater}6\$, a redshift range that was not covered in prior searches. Restricting to relatively strong {MgII} systems (\$W\_r{\textgreater}1\${\textbackslash}{AA}), there is significant evidence for redshift evolution. These systems roughly double in number density between \$z=0\$ and \$z=2\$-\$3\$, but decline by an order of magnitude from this peak by \$z{\textbackslash}sim 6\$. This evolution mirrors that of the global star formation rate density, which could reflect a connection between star formation feedback and strong {MgII} absorbers. We compared our results to the Illustris cosmological simulation at \$z=2\$-\$4\$ by assigning absorption to catalogued dark-matter halos and by direct extraction of spectra from the simulation volume. To reproduce our results using the halo catalogs, we require circumgalactic ({CGM}) {MgII} envelopes within halos of progressively smaller mass at earlier times. This occurs naturally if we define the lower integration cutoff using {SFR} rather than mass. {MgII} profiles calculated directly from the Illustris volume yield far too few strong absorbers. We argue that this arises from unresolved phase space structure of {CGM} gas, particularly from turbulent velocities on sub-mesh scales. The presence of {CGM} {MgII} at \$z{\textgreater}6\$-- just \${\textbackslash}sim 250\$ Myr after the reionization redshift implied by Planck--suggests that enrichment of intra-halo gas may have begun before the presumed host galaxies' stellar populations were mature and dynamically relaxed.

	abstract = {We analyze synthetic neutral hydrogen ({HI}) absorption and emission spectral lines from a high-resolution, three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation to quantify how well observational methods recover physical properties of interstellar clouds. We present a new method for uniformly decomposing {HI} spectral lines and estimating the properties of associated clouds using the Autonomous Gaussian Decomposition ({AGD}) algorithm. We find that {HI} spectral lines recover clouds with excellent completeness at high Galactic latitude, and this completeness declines with decreasing latitude due to strong velocity-blending of spectral lines. The temperature and column density inferred from our decomposition and radiative transfer method agree with the simulated values within a factor of {\textless}2 for the majority of clouds. We next compare synthetic spectra with observations from the 21-{SPONGE} survey at the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array using {AGD}. We find more components per line of sight in 21-{SPONGE} than in synthetic spectra, which reflects insufficient simulated gas scale heights and the limitations of local box simulations. In addition, we find a significant population of low-optical depth, broad absorption components in simulations which are not seen in 21-{SPONGE}. This population is not obvious in integrated or per-channel diagnostics, and reflects the benefit of studying velocity-resolved components. In addition, the discrepant components correspond to the highest spin temperatures (1000{\textless}T\_s{\textless}4000 K), which are not seen in 21-{SPONGE} despite sufficient observational sensitivity. We demonstrate that our analysis method is a powerful tool for diagnosing neutral {ISM} conditions, and future work is needed to improve observational statistics and implementation of simulated physics.},

While the statistical tools presented in this book are applicable to data from medicine, biology, public health, epidemiology, engineering, economics, and demography, the focus here is on applications of the techniques to biology and medicine. The analysis of survival experiments is complicated by issues of censoring, where an individual\&apos;s life length is known to occur only in a certain period of time, and by truncation, where individuals enter the study only if they survive a sufficient length of time or individuals are included in the study only if the event has occurred by a given date. The use of counting process methodology has allowed for substantial advances in the statistical theory to account for censoring and truncation in survival experiments. This book makes these complex methods more accessible to applied researchers without an advanced mathematical background. The authors present the essence of these techniques, as well as classical techniques not based on counting processes, and apply them to data. Practical suggestions for implementing the various methods are set off in a series of Practical Notes at the end of each section. Technical details of the derivation of the techniques are sketched in a series of Technical Notes. This book will be useful for investigators who need to analyze censored or truncated life time data, and as a textbook for a graduate course in survival analysis. The prerequisite is a standard course in statistical methodology.},

We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) approach to constrain the parameters of the best-fitting models, both for the {HI}-halo mass relation and the {HI} radial density profile. We find that a radial exponential profile results in a good fit to the low-redshift {HI} observations, including the clustering and the column density distribution. The form of the profile is also found to match the high-redshift {DLA} observations, when used in combination with a three-parameter {HI}-halo mass relation and a redshift evolution in the {HI} concentration. The halo model predictions are in good agreement with the observed {HI} surface density profiles of low-redshift galaxies, and the general trends in the the impact parameter and covering fraction observations of high-redshift {DLAs}.

The {UV} data are obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph ({COS}) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}) and are supplemented by 21 cm radio observations of neutral hydrogen. Along 270 sightlines we measure metal absorption in the lines of {SiII}, {SiIII}, {CII}, and {CIV} and associated {HI} 21 cm emission in {HVCs} in the velocity range {\textbar}v\_LSR{\textbar}=100-500 km s{\textasciicircum}-1. With this unprecedented large {HVC} sample we were able to improve the statistics on {HVC} covering fractions, ionization conditions, small-scale structure, {CGM} mass, and inflow rate. For the first time, we determine robustly the angular two point correlation function of the high-velocity absorbers, systematically analyze antipodal sightlines on the celestial sphere, and compare the absorption characteristics with that of Damped Lyman alpha absorbers ({DLAs}) and constrained cosmological simulations of the {LG}. Our study demonstrates that the Milky Way {CGM} contains sufficient gaseous material to maintain the Galactic star-formation rate at its current level. We show that the {CGM} is composed of discrete gaseous structures that exhibit a large-scale kinematics together with small-scale variations in physical conditions. The Magellanic Stream clearly dominates both the cross section and mass flow of high-velocity gas in the Milky Way's {CGM}. The possible presence of high-velocity {LG} gas underlines the important role of the local cosmological environment in the large-scale gas-circulation processes in and around the Milky Way (abridged).},

	abstract = {The circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) traced by {OVI} \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}lambda 1031, 1037\$ doublet absorption has been found to concentrate along the projected major and minor axes of the host galaxies. This suggests that {OVI} traces accreting and outflowing gas, respectively, which are key components of the baryon cycle of galaxies. We investigate this further by examining the kinematics of 29 {OVI} absorbers associated with galaxies at \$0.13 {\textless} z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gal\} {\textless} 0.66\$ as a function of galaxy color, inclination, and azimuthal angle. Each galaxy was imaged with {HST} and the absorption was detected in {COS}/{HST} spectra of nearby (\$D{\textless}200\$ kpc) background quasars. We use the pixel-velocity two-point correlation function to characterize the velocity spread of the absorbers, which is a method used previously for a sample of {MgII} absorber--galaxy pairs. The absorption velocity spread for {OVI} is more extended than {MgII}, which suggests that the two ions trace differing components of the {CGM}. Also contrary to {MgII}, the {OVI} absorption velocity spreads are similar regardless of galaxy color, inclination, and azimuthal angle. This indicates that the kinematics of the high ionization gas is not strongly influenced by the present star formation activity in the galaxy. The kinematic homogeneity of {OVI} absorption and its tendency to be observed mainly along the projected galaxy major and minor axes is likely due to varying ionization conditions and gas densities about the galaxy. Gas in intermediate azimuthal angles may be ionized out of the {OVI} phase, possibly resulting in an azimuthal angle dependence on the distribution of gas in higher ionization states.},

	abstract = {We describe the kinematics of circumgalactic gas near the galactic plane, combining new measurements of galaxy rotation curves and spectroscopy of background quasars. The sightlines pass within 19--93 kpc of the target galaxy and generally detect Mg {II} absorption. The Mg {II} Doppler shifts have the same sign as the galactic rotation, so the cold gas co-rotates with the galaxy. Because the absorption spans a broader velocity range than disk rotation can explain, we explore simple models for the circumgalactic kinematics. Gas spiraling inwards (near the disk plane) offers a successful description of the observations. An Appendix describes the addition of tangential and radial gas flows and illustrates how the sign of the disk inclination produces testable differences in the projected line-of-sight velocity range. This inflow interpretation implies that cold flow disks remain common down to redshift \$z {\textbackslash}approx 0.2\$ and prolong star formation by supplying gas to the disk.},

	abstract = {We present a suite of 15 cosmological zoom-in simulations of isolated dark matter halos, all with masses of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\} {\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ at \$z=0\$, in order to understand the relationship between halo assembly, galaxy formation, and feedback's effects on the central density structure in dwarf galaxies. These simulations are part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments ({FIRE}) project and are performed at extremely high resolution. The resultant galaxies have stellar masses that are consistent with rough abundance matching estimates, coinciding with the faintest galaxies that can be seen beyond the virial radius of the Milky Way (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star/\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}5-10{\textasciicircum}7\$). This non-negligible spread in stellar mass at \$z=0\$ in halos within a narrow range of virial masses is strongly correlated with central halo density or maximum circular velocity \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$. Much of this dependence of \$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$ on a second parameter (beyond \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}\$) is a direct consequence of the \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ mass scale coinciding with the threshold for strong reionization suppression: the densest, earliest-forming halos remain above the {UV}-suppression scale throughout their histories while late-forming systems fall below the {UV}-suppression scale over longer periods and form fewer stars as a result. In fact, the latest-forming, lowest-concentration halo in our suite fails to form any stars. Halos that form galaxies with \$M\_{\textbackslash}star{\textbackslash}gtrsim2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ have reduced central densities relative to dark-matter-only simulations, and the radial extent of the density modifications is well-approximated by the galaxy half-mass radius \$r\_\{1/2\}\$. This apparent stellar mass threshold of \$M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}approx 2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{6\} {\textbackslash}approx 2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\} {\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}\$ is broadly consistent with previous work and provides a testable prediction of {FIRE} feedback models in {LCDM}.},

	abstract = {We analyze the role of first (leading) author gender on the number of citations that a paper receives, on the publishing frequency and on the self-citing tendency. We consider a complete sample of over 200,000 publications from 1950 to 2015 from five major astronomy journals. We determine the gender of the first author for over 70\% of all publications. The fraction of papers which have a female first author has increased from less than 5\% in the 1960s to about 25\% today. We find that the increase of the fraction of papers authored by females is slowest in the most prestigious journals such as Science and Nature. Furthermore, female authors write 19\${\textbackslash}pm\$7\% fewer papers in seven years following their first paper than their male colleagues. At all times papers with male first authors receive more citations than papers with female first authors. This difference has been decreasing with time and amounts to \${\textbackslash}sim\$6\% measured over the last 30 years. To account for the fact that the properties of female and male first author papers differ intrinsically, we use a random forest algorithm to control for the non-gender specific properties of these papers which include seniority of the first author, number of references, total number of authors, year of publication, publication journal, field of study and region of the first author's institution. We show that papers authored by females receive 10.4\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.9\% fewer citations than what would be expected if the papers with the same non-gender specific properties were written by the male authors. Finally, we also find that female authors in our sample tend to self-cite more, but that this effect disappears when controlled for non-gender specific variables.},

Our simulations quantify the role of cooling, stellar feedback driven galactic winds and cosmological gas accretion in setting the properties of the {CGM} in dark matter haloes ranging from \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. Our simulations support a conceptual picture in which the properties of the {CGM}, and the key physics governing it, change markedly near a critical halo mass of M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm crit\} {\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. As in calculations without stellar feedback, above M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm crit\}\$ halo gas is supported by thermal pressure created in the virial shock. The thermal properties at small radii are regulated by feedback triggered when \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}{\textbackslash}lesssim10\$ in the hot gas. Below M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm crit\}\$, however, there is no thermally supported halo and self-regulation at \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}{\textbackslash}sim10\$ does not apply. Instead, the gas is out of hydrostatic equilibrium and largely supported against gravity by bulk flows (turbulence and coherent inflow/outflow) arising from the interaction between cosmological gas inflow and outflowing galactic winds. In these lower mass haloes, the phase structure depends sensitively on the outflows' energy per unit mass and mass-loading, which may allow measurements of the {CGM} thermal state to constrain the nature of galactic winds. Our simulations account for some of the properties of the multiphase halo gas inferred from quasar absorption line observations, including the presence of significant mass at a wide range of temperatures, and the characteristic {OVI} and {CIV} column densities and kinematics. However, we underpredict the neutral hydrogen content of the \$z{\textbackslash}sim0\$ {CGM}.},

By tracing cosmic inflows, galactic outflows, gas recycling, and merger histories, we quantify the contribution of physically distinct sources of material to galaxy growth. We show that in situ star formation fueled by fresh accretion dominates the early growth of galaxies of all masses, while the re-accretion of gas previously ejected in galactic winds often dominates the gas supply for a large portion of every galaxy's evolution. Externally processed material contributes increasingly to the growth of central galaxies at lower redshifts. This includes stars formed ex situ and gas delivered by mergers, as well as smooth intergalactic transfer of gas from other galaxies, an important but previously under-appreciated growth mode. By \$z=0\$, wind transfer, i.e. the exchange of gas between galaxies via winds, can dominate gas accretion onto \${\textbackslash}sim L{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$ galaxies over fresh accretion and standard wind recycling. Galaxies of all masses re-accrete {\textgreater}50\% of the gas ejected in winds and recurrent recycling is common. The total mass deposited in the intergalactic medium per unit stellar mass formed increases in lower mass galaxies. Re-accretion of wind ejecta occurs over a broad range of timescales, with median recycling times (\${\textbackslash}sim 100-350\$ Myr) shorter than previously found. Wind recycling typically occurs at the scale radius of the halo, independent of halo mass and redshift, suggesting a characteristic recycling zone around galaxies that scales with the size of the inner halo and the galaxy's stellar component.},

	abstract = {We have developed a parallel code called "{VoIgt} profile Parameter Estimation Routine ({VIPER})" for automatically fitting the H I Ly-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest seen in the spectra of {QSOs}. We obtained the H I column density distribution function ({CDDF}) and line width (\$b\$) parameter distribution for \$z {\textless} 0.45\$ using spectra of 82 {QSOs} obtained using Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and {VIPER}. Consistency of these with the existing measurements in the literature validate our code. By comparing this {CDDF} with those obtained from hydrodynamical simulation, we constrain the H I photoionization rate (\${\textbackslash}Gamma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {HI}\}\$) at \$z {\textless} 0.45\$ in four redshift bins. The {VIPER}, together with the Code for Ionization and Temperature Evolution ({CITE}) we have developed for {GADGET}-2, allows us to explore parameter space and perform \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ minimization to obtain \${\textbackslash}Gamma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {HI}\}\$. We notice that the \$b\$ parameters from the simulations are smaller than what are derived from the observations. We show the observed \$b\$ parameter distribution and \$b\$ vs \${\textbackslash}log \{{\textbackslash}rm N\_\{{HI}\}\}\$ scatter can be reproduced in simulation by introducing sub-grid scale turbulence. However, it has very little influence on the derived \${\textbackslash}Gamma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {HI}\}\$.

To understand these results, we use a suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments ({FIRE}) project, which include physically motivated models of the multi-phase {ISM}, star formation, and stellar feedback. Our simulations reproduce the observed diversity of kinematic properties and metallicity gradients, broadly consistent with observations at z=0-3. Strong negative metallicity gradients only appear in galaxies with a rotating disk, but not all rotationally supported galaxies have significant gradients. Strongly perturbed galaxies with little rotation always have flat gradients. The kinematic properties and metallicity gradient of a high-redshift galaxy can vary significantly on short time-scales, associated with starburst episodes. Feedback from a starburst can destroy the gas disk, drive strong outflows, and flatten a pre-existing negative metallicity gradient. The time variability of a single galaxy is statistically similar to the entire simulated sample, indicating that the observed metallicity gradients in high-redshift galaxies reflect the instantaneous state of the galaxy rather than the accretion and growth history on cosmological time-scales. We find weak dependence of metallicity gradient on stellar mass and specific star formation rate ({sSFR}). Low-mass galaxies and galaxies with high {sSFR} tend to have flat gradients, likely due to the fact that feedback is more efficient in these galaxies. We argue that it is important to resolve feedback on small scales in order to produce the diverse metallicity gradients observed.},

Conversely, metallicity estimates are less sensitive to the assumptions behind ionisation corrections. {LLSs} at z{\textgreater}2 are characterised by a broad unimodal distribution over {\textgreater}4 orders of magnitude, with a peak at log Z/Zsun{\textasciitilde}-2. {LLSs} are metal poor, significantly less enriched than {DLAs}, with {\textasciitilde}70\% of the metallicity {PDF} below log Z/Zsun{\textless}-1.5.

We therefore suggest that "clouds" of cold, atomic gas may in fact have the structure of a mist or a fog, composed of tiny fragments dispersed throughout the ambient medium. We show that this scale emerges in hydrodynamic simulations, and that the corresponding increase in the surface area may imply rapid entrainment of cold gas. We also apply it to a number of observational puzzles, including the large covering fraction of diffuse gas in galaxy halos, the broad line widths seen in quasar and {AGN} spectra, and the entrainment of cold gas in galactic winds. While our simulations make a number of assumptions and thus have associated uncertainties, we show that this characteristic scale is consistent with a number of observations, across a wide range of astrophysical environments. We discuss future steps for testing, improving, and extending our model.},

	abstract = {We use a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to quantify the accretion rates of baryons into dark matter halos and the resulting baryon mass fractions, as a function of halo mass, redshift, and baryon type (including cold and hot gas). We find that the net baryonic accretion rates through the virial radius are sensitive to galactic outflows and explore a range of outflow parameters to illustrate the effects. We show that the cold gas accretion rate is in general not a simple universal factor of the dark matter accretion rate, and that galactic winds can cause star formation rates to deviate significantly from the external gas accretion rates, both via gas ejection and re-accretion. Furthermore, galactic winds can inject enough energy and momentum in the surrounding medium to slow down accretion altogether, especially in low-mass halos and at low redshift. By resolving the accretion rates versus radius from the halo centers, we show how cold streams penetrate the hot atmospheres of massive halos at z{\textgreater}2, but gradually disappear at lower redshift. The total baryon mass fraction is also strongly suppressed by outflows in low-mass halos, but is nearly universal in the absence of feedback in halos above the {UV} background suppression scale. The transition halo mass, at which the gas mass in halos is equal for the cold and hot components, is roughly constant at {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}11.5 Msun and does not depend sensitively on the wind prescription. We provide simple fitting formulae for the cold gas accretion rate into halos in the no-wind case. Finally, we show that cold accretion is broadly consistent with driving the bulk of the highly star-forming galaxies observed at z{\textasciitilde}2, but that the more intense star formers likely sample the high end of the accretion rate distribution, and may be additionally fueled by a combination of gas recycling, gas re-accretion, hot mode cooling, and mergers.},

	abstract = {We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with stellar feedback from the {FIRE} project to study the physical nature of Lyman limit systems ({LLSs}) at z{\textless}1. At these low redshifts, {LLSs} are closely associated with dense gas structures surrounding galaxies, such as galactic winds, dwarf satellites, and cool inflows from the intergalactic medium. Our analysis is based on 14 zoom-in simulations covering the halo mass range M\_h{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}9-10{\textasciicircum}13 Msun at z=0, which we convolve with the dark matter halo mass function to produce cosmological statistics. We find that the majority of cosmologically-selected {LLSs} are associated with halos in the mass range 10{\textasciicircum}10 {\textless} M\_h {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun. The incidence and {HI} column density distribution of simulated absorbers with columns 10{\textasciicircum}16.2 {\textless} N\_HI {\textless} 2x10{\textasciicircum}20 cm{\textasciicircum}-2 are consistent with observations. High-velocity outflows (with radial velocity exceeding the halo circular velocity by a factor {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}2) tend to have higher metallicities ([X/H] {\textasciitilde} -0.5) while very low metallicity ([X/H] {\textless} -2) {LLSs} are typically associated with gas infalling from the intergalactic medium. However, most {LLSs} occupy an intermediate region in metallicity-radial velocity space, for which there is no clear trend between metallicity and radial kinematics. Metal-enriched inflows arise in the {FIRE} simulations as a result of galactic winds that fall back onto galaxies at low redshift. The overall simulated {LLS} metallicity distribution has a mean (standard deviation) [X/H] = -0.9 (0.4) and does not show significant evidence for bimodality, in contrast to recent observational studies but consistent with {LLSs} arising from halos with a broad range of masses and metallicities.},

	title = {The role of mergers and halo spin in shaping galaxy morphology},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09498},
	abstract = {Mergers and the spin of the dark matter halo are factors traditionally believed to determine the morphology of galaxies within a \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} cosmology. We study this hypothesis by considering approximately 18,000 central galaxies at \$z=0\$ with stellar masses \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\} {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\} {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ selected from the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. The fraction of accreted stars -- which measures the importance of massive, recent and dry mergers relative to in situ star formation -- increases steeply with galaxy stellar mass, from less than 5 per cent in dwarfs to 80 per cent in the most massive objects, and the impact of mergers on galaxy morphology increases accordingly. For galaxies with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\} {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, mergers have the expected effect: if gas-poor they promote the formation of spheroidal galaxies, whereas gas-rich mergers favour the formation and survivability of massive discs. This trend, however, breaks at lower masses. For objects with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\} {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, mergers do not seem to play any significant role in determining the morphology, with accreted stellar fractions and mean merger gas fractions that are indistinguishable between spheroidal and disc-dominated galaxies. On the other hand, halo spin correlates with morphology primarily in the least massive objects in the sample (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\} {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$), but only weakly for galaxies above that mass. Our results support a scenario where (1) mergers play a dominant role in shaping the morphology of massive galaxies, (2) halo spin is important for the morphology of dwarfs, and (3) the morphology of Milky Way-sized objects, at the transition between these two regimes, shows little dependence (at least in a straightforward way) on galaxy assembly history or the angular momentum content of the dark matter halo.},

	volume = {000},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07815},
	abstract = {Galaxy populations at different cosmic epochs are often linked together by comoving cumulative number density in observational studies. Many theoretical works, however, have shown that the number densities of tracked galaxy populations evolve in bulk and spread out over time. We present a number density method for linking progenitor and descendant galaxy populations which takes both of these effects into account. We define probability distribution functions that capture the evolution and dispersion of galaxy populations in comoving number density space, and use these functions to assign galaxies at one redshift \$z\_f\$ probabilities of being progenitors or descendants of a galaxy population at another redshift \$z\_0\$. These probabilities are then used as weights for calculating distributions of physical properties such as stellar mass, star formation rate, or velocity dispersion within the progenitor/descendant population. We demonstrate that this probabilistic method provides more accurate predictions for the evolution of physical properties then either the assumption of a constant number density or the assumption of an evolving number density in a bin of fixed width by comparing the predictions against galaxy populations directly tracked through a cosmological simulation. We find that the constant number density method performs most poorly at recovering galaxy properties, the evolving number method density slightly better, and the probabilistic number density method best of all. The improvement is present for predictions of both stellar mass as well as inferred quantities such as star formation rate and velocity dispersion which were not included in the number density fits. We demonstrate that this method can also be applied robustly and easily to observational data, and provide a code package for doing so.},

	doi = {10.1093/mnras/stv2738},
	abstract = {Massive quiescent galaxies have much smaller physical sizes at high redshift than today. The strong evolution of galaxy size may be caused by progenitor bias, major and minor mergers, adiabatic expansion, and/or renewed star formation, but it is difficult to test these theories observationally. Herein, we select a sample of 35 massive, compact galaxies (\$M\_* = 1-3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, \$M\_*/R{\textasciicircum}\{1.5\} {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$/kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{1.5\}\$) at \$z=2\$ in the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Illustris and trace them forward to \$z=0\$ to uncover their evolution and identify their descendants. By \$z=0\$, the original factor of 3 difference in stellar mass spreads to a factor of 20. The dark matter halo masses similarly spread from a factor of 5 to 40. The galaxies' evolutionary paths are diverse: about half acquire an ex-situ envelope and are the core of a more massive descendant, a third survive undisturbed and gain very little mass, 15\% are consumed in a merger with a more massive galaxy, and a small remainder are thoroughly mixed by major mergers. The galaxies grow in size as well as mass, and only \${\textbackslash}sim\$10\% remain compact by \$z=0\$. The majority of the size growth is driven by the acquisition of ex-situ mass. The most massive galaxies at \$z=0\$ are the most likely to have compact progenitors, but this trend possesses significant dispersion which precludes a direct linkage to compact galaxies at \$z=2\$. The compact galaxies' merger rates are influenced by their \$z=2\$ environments, so that isolated or satellite compact galaxies (which are protected from mergers) are the most likely to survive to the present day.},

The particle masses and force softenings are chosen to resolve the mass profile to below 1\% of the virial radius at all masses, ensuring that galaxy half-light radii are well resolved. Using the same treatment of star formation and stellar feedback for every object, the simulated galaxies reproduce the observed inefficiency of galaxy formation across cosmic time as expressed through the stellar mass vs halo mass relation, and the star formation rate vs stellar mass relation. We thus conclude that stellar feedback is the chief piece of physics required to limit the efficiency of star formation in galaxies less massive than the {MilkyWay}.},

This survey is designed to document the evolution of galaxies and black holes at z ≈ 1.5–8, and to study Type Ia supernovae at z {\textgreater} 1.5. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive multi-wavelength observations. The primary {CANDELS} data consist of imaging obtained in the Wide Field Camera 3 infrared channel ({WFC}3/{IR}) and the {WFC}3 ultraviolet/optical channel, along with the Advanced Camera for Surveys ({ACS}). The {CANDELS}/Deep survey covers ∼125 arcmin 2 within {GOODS}-N and {GOODS}-S, while the remainder consists of the {CANDELS}/ Wide survey, achieving a total of ∼800 arcmin 2 across {GOODS} and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, {COSMOS}, and Ultra-Deep Survey). We summarize the observational aspects of the survey as motivated by the scientific goals and present a detailed description of the data reduction procedures and products from the survey. Our data reduction methods utilize the most up-to-date calibration files and image combination procedures. We have paid special attention to correcting a range of instrumental effects, including charge transfer efficiency degradation for {ACS}, removal of electronic bias-striping present in {ACS} data after Servicing Mission 4, and persistence effects and other artifacts in {WFC}3/{IR}. For each field, we release mosaics for individual epochs and eventual mosaics containing data from all epochs combined, to facilitate photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry. A more detailed overview of the science goals and observational design of the survey are presented in a companion paper.},

We find a surprising lack of correlations between the halo mass (virial velocity) and either the velocity dispersions or velocity offsets of the Lyman{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ lines. The ratio of the velocity offset to the velocity dispersion for the Lyman{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ absorbers has a mean value of \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 4, suggesting that a given the line-of-sight is intersecting a dynamically coherent structure in the {CGM} rather than a sea of orbiting clouds.

	abstract = {The spatial distribution of neutral hydrogen ({HI}) in the Universe contains a wealth of cosmological information. The 21 cm emission line can be used to map the {HI} up to very high redshift and therefore reveal us something about the evolution of the large scale structures in the Universe. However little is known about the abundance and clustering properties of the {HI} over cosmic time. Motivated by this, we build an analytic framework where the relevant parameters that govern how the {HI} is distributed among dark matter halos can be fixed using observations. At the same time we provide tools to study the column density distribution function of the {HI} absorbers together with their clustering properties. Our formalism is the first one able to account for all observations at a single redshift, \$z = 2.3\$. The linear bias of the {HI} and the mean number density of {HI} sources, two main ingredients in the calculation of the signal-to-noise ratio of a cosmological survey, are then discussed in detail, also extrapolating the results to low and high redshift. We find that {HI} bias is relatively higher than the value reported in similar studies, but the shot noise level is always sub dominant, making the {HI} Power Spectrum always a high signal-to-noise measurements up to \$z{\textbackslash}simeq5\$ in the limit of no instrumental noise and foreground contamination.},

	title = {Are Cosmological Gas Accretion Streams Multiphase and Turbulent?},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04405},
	abstract = {Simulations of cosmological filamentary accretion streams into galactic halos reveal that such flows are warm at T\${\textbackslash}sim\$10\${\textasciicircum}4\$K, laminar, and provide high gas accretion efficiency onto galaxies. We present a phenomenological scenario which suggests that accretion flows are shocked, become thermally unstable, biphasic, and are, as a result, turbulent. We consider a collimated stream of warm gas over denser than the hot, virialized halo gas. The post-shock streaming gas has a higher pressure than the ambient halo gas, expands, and is thermally unstable and fragments, forming a two phase medium -- a hot phase with an embedded warm cloudy phase. The thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas is largely determined by the relative timescales of several processes, namely the cooling, the expansion of the hot phase and turbulent warm clouds, and the amount of turbulence in clouds, and the halo dynamics. The cooling is moderated by mixing with the ambient halo gas and heating due to turbulent dissipation. We consider the evolution of a stream for a single halo mass, 10\${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, and redshift, 2. We find that the gas becomes thermally unstable and fragments into a two-phase medium where the cooler phase is highly turbulent and has a lower bulk velocity than the initial stream. The turbulent stream loses coherence in less than a halo dynamical time. Both the phase separation and "disruption" of the stream imply that the accretion efficiency onto a galaxy in a dynamical time may be less than in simulations having laminar isothermal flows. De-collimating flows make the direct interaction between galaxy feedback and accretion streams more likely, thereby further reducing the overall accretion efficiency. Moderating the gas accretion efficiency through these mechanisms may help to alleviate a number of significant challenges in theoretical galaxy formation. [abridged]},

	abstract = {We address the origin of the robust bimodality observed in galaxy properties about a characteristic stellar mass {\textasciitilde}3 × 1010Msolar. Less massive galaxies tend to be ungrouped blue star forming discs, while more massive galaxies are typically grouped red old-star spheroids. Colour-magnitude data show a gap between the red and blue sequences, extremely red luminous galaxies already at z{\textasciitilde} 1, a truncation of today's blue sequence above L*, and massive starbursts at z{\textasciitilde} 2-4. We propose that these features are driven by the thermal properties of the inflowing gas and their interplay with the clustering and feedback processes, all functions of the dark matter halo mass and associated with a similar characteristic scale. In haloes below a critical shock-heating mass Mshock{\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1012Msolar, discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial shock, yielding efficient early star formation. It is regulated by supernova feedback into a long sequence of bursts in blue galaxies constrained to a `fundamental line'. Cold streams penetrating through hot media in M{\textgreater}=Mshock haloes preferentially at z{\textgreater}= 2 lead to massive starbursts in L {\textgreater} L* galaxies. At z {\textless} 2, in M {\textgreater} Mshock haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock, and being dilute it becomes vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such as active galactic nuclei. This shuts off gas supply and prevents further star formation, leading by passive evolution to `red-and-dead' massive spheroids starting at z{\textasciitilde} 1. A minimum in feedback efficiency near Mshock explains the observed minimum in M/L and the qualitative features of the star formation history. The cold flows provide a hint for solving the angular momentum problem. When these processes are incorporated in simulations they recover the main bimodality features and solve other open puzzles.},

	abstract = {Utilizing high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations we investigate various ultra-violet absorption lines in the circumgalactic medium of star forming galaxies at low redshift, in hopes of checking and alleviating the claimed observational conundrum of the ratio of {NV} to {OVI} absorbers, among others. We find a satisfactory agreement between simulations and extant observational data with respect to the ratios of the following four line pairs examined, {NV}/{OVI}, {SiIV}/{OVI}, {NIII}/{OVI} and {NII}/{OVI}. For the pairs involving nitrogen lines, we examine two cases of nitrogen abundance, one with constant N/O ratio and the other with varying N/O ratio, with the latter motivated by theoretical considerations of two different synthetic sources of nitrogen that is empirically verified independently. Along a separate vector, for all line pairs, we examine two cases of radiation field, one with the Haardt-Madau background radiation field and the other with an additional local radiation field sourced by hot gas in the host galaxy. In all cases, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests indicate excellent agreements. We find that the apparent agreements between simulations and observations will be strongly tested, if the bulk of current upper limits of various line ratios are turned into actual detections. We show that an increase in observational sensitivity by 0.2 dex will already start to significantly constrain the models.},

	abstract = {Protogalactic environments are typically identified using quasar absorption lines, and these galactic building blocks can manifest as Damped Lyman-Alpha Absorbers ({DLAs}) and Lyman Limit Systems ({LLSs}). We use radio observations of Faraday effects to test whether {DLAs} and {LLSs} host a magnetised medium, by combining {DLA} and {LLS} detections throughout the literature with 1.4 {GHz} polarization data from the {NRAO} {VLA} Sky Survey ({NVSS}). We obtain a control, a {DLA}, and a {LLS} sample consisting of 114, 19, and 27 lines-of-sight respectively - all of which are polarized at \${\textbackslash}ge8{\textbackslash}sigma\$ to ensure Rician bias is negligible. Using a Bayesian framework, we are unable to detect either coherent or random magnetic fields in {DLAs}: the regular coherent magnetic fields within the {DLAs} must be \${\textbackslash}le2.8\$ \${\textbackslash}mu\$G, and the lack of depolarization is consistent with the weakly magnetised gas in {DLAs} being non-turbulent and quiescent. However, we find mild suggestive evidence that {LLSs} have coherent magnetic fields: after controlling for the redshift-distribution of our data, we find a 71.5\% probability that {LLSs} have a higher {RM} than a control sample. We also find strong evidence that {LLSs} host random magnetic fields, with a 95.5\% probability that {LLS} lines-of-sight have lower polarized fractions than a control sample. The regular coherent magnetic fields within the {LLSs} must be \${\textbackslash}le2.4\$ \${\textbackslash}mu\$G, and the magnetised gas must be highly turbulent with a typical scale on the order of \${\textbackslash}approx5\$-20 pc, which is similar to that of the Milky Way. This is consistent with the standard dynamo pedagogy, whereby magnetic fields in protogalaxies increase in coherence and strength as a function of cosmic time. Our results are consistent with a hierarchical galaxy formation scenario, with the {DLAs}, {LLSs}, and strong magnesium {II} ({MgII}) systems exploring three different stages of magnetic field evolution in galaxies.},

	abstract = {Virial shocks at edges of cosmic-web structures are a clear prediction of standard structure formation theories. We derive a criterion for the stability of the post-shock gas and of the virial shock itself in spherical, filamentary and planar infall geometries. When gas cooling is important, we find that shocks become unstable, and gas flows uninterrupted towards the center of the respective halo, filament or sheet. For filaments, we impose this criterion on self-similar infall solutions. We find that instability is expected for filament masses between \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}.\$ Using a simplified toy model, we then show that these filaments will likely feed halos with \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textbackslash}lesssim M\_\{halo\}{\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at redshift \$z=3\$, as well as \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textbackslash}lesssim M\_\{halo\}{\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at \$z=0\$.   The instability will affect the survivability of the filaments as they penetrate gaseous halos in a non-trivial way. Additionally, smaller halos accreting onto non-stable filaments will not be subject to ram-pressure inside the filaments. The instreaming gas will continue towards the center, and stop either once its angular momentum balances the gravitational attraction, or when its density becomes so high that it becomes self-shielded to radiation.},

The cool Hi covering fraction and column density profiles match observations well, particularly in the inner {CGM}. Ovi shows increasing column densities with mass, a trend seemingly echoed in the observations. As in multiple previous simulations, the Ovi column densities in simulations are lower than observed and optically thick Hi does not extend as far out as in observations. We make observable predictions of the bipolarity of outflows and their effect on the general shape of the {CGM}. Bipolar outflows can be seen out to around 40 kpc, but outside that radius, the {CGM} is too well mixed to detect an elongated shape. The simulated {CGM} is remarkably spherical even in low mass simulations.

In this work, we vary the extragalactic ultraviolet background for a high-resolution cosmological simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy and examine the effect on the absorption and emission properties of metals in the {CGM}. We find that a reduced quasar background brings the column density predictions into better agreement with recent data. Similarly, when the observationally derived physical properties of the gas are compared to the simulation, we find that the simulation gas is always at temperatures approximately 0.5 dex higher. Thus, similar column densities can be produced from fundamentally different gas. However, emission maps can provide complementary information to the line-of-sight column densities to better derive gas properties. From the simulations, we find that the brightest emission is less sensitive to the extragalactic background and that it closely follows the fundamental filamentary structure of the halo. This becomes increasingly true as the galaxy evolves from z=1 to z=0 and the majority of the gas transitions to a hotter, more diffuse phase. For the brightest ions ({CIII}, {CIV}, {OVI}), detectable emission can extend as far as 120 kpc at z=0. Finally, resolution is a limiting factor for the conclusions we can draw from emission observations but with moderate resolution and reasonable detection limits, upcoming instrumentation should place constraints on the physical properties of the {CGM}.},

I show that this characteristic scale can be up to an order of magnitude lower than the linear theory Jeans mass, and that even if one defines the Jeans mass at a higher overdensity, it does not track the evolution of this characteristic suppression mass. Instead, the filtering mass, which corresponds directly to the scale over which baryonic perturbations are smoothed in linear perturbation theory, provides a remarkably good fit to the characteristic mass scale. Thus, it appears that the effect of reionization on structure formation in both the linear and nonlinear regimes is described by a single characteristic scale, the filtering scale of baryonic perturbations. In contrast to the Jeans mass, the filtering mass depends on the full thermal history of the gas instead of the instantaneous value of the sound speed, so it accounts for the finite time required for pressure to influence the gas distribution in the expanding universe. In addition to the characteristic suppression mass, I study the full shape of the probability distribution to find an object with a given gas mass among all the objects with the same total mass, and I show that the numerical results can be described by a simple fitting formula that again depends only on the filtering mass. This simple description of the probability distribution may be useful for semi-analytical modeling of structure formation in the early universe.},

The stellar masses of central galaxies in halos with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{200c\}\} {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$ were shown to correlate with the {DMO} halo maximum circular velocity, with \${\textbackslash}approx 0.2\$ dex of scatter that is uncorrelated with other {DMO} halo properties. Here we revisit the origin of the scatter in the \$M\_\{*\}-V\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{max, {DMO}\}\}\$ relation in {EAGLE} at \$z = 0.1\$. We find that the scatter in \$M\_\{*\}\$ correlates with the mean age of the galaxy stellar population such that more massive galaxies at fixed \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{max, {DMO}\}\}\$ are younger. The scatter in the stellar mass and mean stellar population age results from variation in the baryonic mass, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{bary\}\} = M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{gas\}\} + M\_\{*\}\$, of the galaxies' progenitors at fixed halo mass and concentration. At the redshift of peak correlation (\$z {\textbackslash}approx 1\$), the progenitor baryonic mass accounts for \$76{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the variance in the \$z=0.1\$ \$M\_\{*\}-V\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{max, {DMO}\}\}\$ relation. The scatter in the baryonic mass, in turn, is primarily set by differences in feedback strength and gas accretion over the course of the evolution of each halo.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07192},
	abstract = {We now have mounting evidences that the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) of galaxies is polluted with metals processed through stars. The fate of these metals is however still an open question and several findings indicate that they remain poorly mixed. A powerful tool to study the low-density gas of the {CGM} is offered by absorption lines in quasar spectra, although the information retrieved is limited to 1D along the sightline. We report the serendipitous discovery of two close-by bright z\_gal=1.148 extended galaxies with a fortuitous intervening z\_abs=1.067 foreground absorber. {MUSE} {IFU} observations spatially probes kpc-scales in absorption in the plane of the sky over a total area spanning {\textasciitilde}30 kpc{\textasciicircum}-2. We identify two {OII} emitters at z\_abs down to 21 kpc with {SFR}{\textasciitilde}2 M\_sun/yr. We measure small fractional variations ({\textless}30\%) in the equivalent widths of {FeII} and {MgII} cold gas absorbers on coherence scales of 8kpc but stronger variation on larger scales (25kpc). We compute the corresponding cloud gas mass {\textless}2x10{\textasciicircum}9M\_sun. Our results indicate a good efficiency of the metal mixing on kpc-scales in the {CGM} of a typical z{\textasciitilde}1 galaxy. This study show-cases new prospects for mapping the distribution and sizes of metal clouds observed in absorption against extended background sources with 3D spectroscopy.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05348},
	abstract = {Active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) are thought to play a critical role in shaping galaxies, but their effect on the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) is not well studied. We present results from the {COS}-{AGN} survey: 19 quasar sightlines that probe the {CGM} of 20 optically-selected {AGN} host galaxies with impact parameters \$80 {\textless} {\textbackslash}rho\_\{imp\} {\textless} 300\$ kpc. Absorption lines from a variety of species are measured and compared to a stellar mass and impact parameter matched sample of sightlines through non-{AGN} galaxies. Amongst the observed species in the {COS}-{AGN} sample ({HI}, {CII}, {SiII}, {SiIII}, {CIV}, {SiIV}, {NV}), only Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ shows a high covering fraction (\$94{\textasciicircum}\{+6\}\_\{-23\}\$\% for rest-frame equivalent widths {EW} \${\textgreater} 124\$ m{\textbackslash}{AA}) whilst many of the metal ions are not detected in individual sightlines. A sightline-by-sightline comparison between {COS}-{AGN} and the control sample yields no significant difference in {EW} distribution. However, stacked spectra of the {COS}-{AGN} and control samples show significant ({\textgreater} 3 sigma) enhancements in the {EW} of both {SiIII} and Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ at impact parameters \${\textgreater} 164\$ kpc by a factor of \$+0.45{\textbackslash}pm0.05\$ dex and \${\textgreater} +0.75\$ dex respectively. The lack of detections of both high-ionization species near the {AGN} and strong kinematic offsets between the absorption systemic galaxy redshifts indicates that neither the {AGN}'s ionization nor its outflows are the origin of these differences. Instead, we suggest the observed differences could result from either {AGN} hosts residing in haloes with intrinsically distinct gas properties, or that their {CGM} has been affected by a previous event, such as a starburst, which may also have fuelled the nuclear activity.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03903},
	abstract = {The Galactic halo contains a complex ecosystem of multiphase intermediate-velocity and high-velocity gas clouds whose origin has defied clear explanation. They are generally believed to be involved in a Galaxy-wide recycling process, either through an accretion flow or a large-scale fountain flow, or both. Here we examine the evolution of these clouds in light of recent claims that they may trigger condensation of gas from the Galactic corona as they move through it. Specifically, we measure gas condensation along a cloud's wake, with and without the presence of an ambient magnetic field, using two- and three-dimensional, high-resolution Adaptive Mesh Refinement ({AMR}) simulations. We find that three-dimensional simulations are essential to capture the condensation even when no magnetic field is included. Magnetic fields significantly inhibit condensation in the wake of clouds at \$t {\textbackslash}gtrsim 25\$ Myr, preventing the sharp upturn in cold gas mass seen in previous non-magnetic studies. The magnetic field suppresses the onset of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability which is responsible for the ablation and consequent mixing of cloud and halo gas that drives the condensation. This effect is universal across different properties of the cloud (density, metallicity, and velocity) and of the magnetic field (strength and orientation), with exception of weak fields parallel to the cloud's motion. Our results show that an ambient magnetic field drastically lowers the efficiency of fountain-driven accretion and the efficiency of recycling and accretion from condensation around high-velocity clouds.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01484},
	abstract = {Galactic-scale outflows regulate the stellar mass growth and chemical enrichment of galaxies, yet key outflow properties such as the chemical composition and mass loss rate remain largely unknown. We address these physical properties with rest-frame ultraviolet spectra of nine gravitationally lensed z=2-3 star forming galaxies taken with Keck/{ESI}. Using transitions spanning a range of optical depths and atomic elements, we study the kinematics, covering fractions, and composition of the interstellar medium in our sample. The interstellar medium seen in absorption is dominated by outflowing material, with typical velocities -150 km/s. Approximately 80\% of the total column density is associated with a net outflow. Mass loss rates in the low ionization phase are comparable to or in excess of the star formation rate, with total outflow rates likely higher when accounting for ionized gas. Of order half of the heavy element yield from star formation is ejected in the low ionization phase, confirming that outflows play a critical role in regulating galaxy chemical evolution. Covering fractions vary and are in general non-uniform, with most galaxies having incomplete covering by the low ions across all velocities. Our sample spans an order of magnitude in column density yet ionic abundance patterns show remarkably little scatter, revealing a distinct "chemical fingerprint" of outflows. Gas phase Si abundances are significantly super-solar relative to Fe and Ni ([Si/Fe]\${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$0.4), indicating a combination of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-enhancement and dust depletion. Derived properties are comparable to the most kinematically broad, metal-rich, and depleted {DLAs} at similar redshifts, suggesting that these extreme systems are associated with galactic outflows at small impact parameters. We discuss implications of the abundance patterns in z=2-3 galaxies and the role of outflows at this epoch.},

The catalogues contain 5-parameter astrometry, radial velocities, multi-band photometry, stellar parameters, dust extinction values, and uncertainties in all these quantities. In addition, we provide theoretical quantities from the simulations, including the gravitational potential and information on the origin of each star. By way of demonstration we apply the mock catalogues to the young stellar disc and the stellar halo.

We study halo global properties and radial profiles out to \${\textbackslash}sim 150\$ kpc for each individual galaxy. The Auriga haloes are diverse in their masses and density profiles; mean metallicity and metallicity gradients; ages; and shapes, reflecting the stochasticity inherent in their accretion and merger histories. A comparison with observations of nearby late-type galaxies shows very good agreement between most observed and simulated halo properties. However, Auriga haloes are typically too massive. We find a connection between population gradients and mass assembly history: galaxies with few significant progenitors have more massive haloes, possess large negative halo metallicity gradients and steeper density profiles. The number of accreted galaxies, either disrupted or under disruption, that contribute 90\% of the accreted halo mass ranges from 2 to 15, with a median of 6.5, and their stellar masses span over three orders of magnitude. The observed halo mass--metallicity relation is well reproduced by Auriga and is set by the stellar mass and metallicity of the dominant satellite contributors. This relationship is found not only for the accreted component but also for the total (accreted + in-situ) stellar halo.

By combining a realisation of the Millennium Simulation (Springel et al.) with a simulation of a smaller volume focussing on dwarf haloes, our study spans five decades in halo mass, from 10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun/h to 10{\textasciicircum}15 Msun/h. We find that the baryon fraction within the halo virial radius is typically 90\% of the cosmic mean, with an rms scatter of 6\%, independently of redshift and of halo mass down to the smallest resolved haloes. Our results show that, contrary to the proposal of Mo et al. (2005), pre-virialisation gravitational heating is unable to prevent the collapse of gas within galactic and proto-galactic haloes, and confirm the need for non-gravitational feedback in order to reduce the efficiency of gas cooling and star formation in dwarf galaxy haloes. Simulations including a simple photoheating model (where a gas temperature floor of T\_\{floor\} = 2x10{\textasciicircum}4 K is imposed from z=11) confirm earlier suggestions that photoheating can only prevent the collapse of baryons in systems with virial temperatures T\_\{200\} {\textless} {\textasciitilde}2.2 T\_\{floor\} {\textasciitilde} 4.4x10{\textasciicircum}4 K (corresponding to a virial mass of M\_\{200\} {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun/h and a circular velocity of V\_\{200\} {\textasciitilde} 35 km/s). Photoheating may thus help regulate the formation of dwarf spheroidals and other galaxies at the extreme faint-end of the luminosity function, but it cannot, on its own, reconcile the abundance of sub-L* galaxies with the vast number of dwarf haloes expected in the {LambdaCDM} cosmogony. The lack of evolution or mass dependence seen in the baryon fraction augurs well for X-ray cluster studies that assume a universal and non-evolving baryon fraction to place constraints on cosmological parameters.},

This is significantly lower than the filtering mass obtained by the linear theory, which is often used in semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. We demonstrate it is the gas temperature at the virial radius which determines whether a halo can accrete gas. A simple model that follows the merger history of the dark matter progenitors, and where gas accretion is not allowed when this temperature is higher than the virial temperature of the halo, reproduces the results from the simulation remarkably well. This model can be applied to any reionization history, and is easy to incorporate in semi-analytical models.},

	abstract = {We study the effect of baryons on the abundance of structures and substructures in a Lambda-{CDM} cosmology, using a pair of high resolution cosmological simulations from the {GIMIC} project. Both simulations use identical initial conditions, but while one contains only dark matter, the other also includes baryons. We find that gas pressure, reionisation, supernova feedback, stripping, and truncated accretion systematically reduce the total mass and the abundance of structures below {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}12 solar masses compared to the pure dark matter simulation. Taking this into account and adopting an appropriate detection threshold lowers the abundance of observed galaxies with maximum circular velocities below 100 km/s, significantly reducing the reported discrepancy between Lambda-{CDM} and the measured {HI} velocity function of the {ALFALFA} survey. We also show that the stellar-to-total mass ratios of galaxies with stellar masses of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}5 - 10{\textasciicircum}7 solar masses inferred from abundance matching of the (sub)halo mass function to the observed galaxy mass function increase by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2. In addition, we find that an important fraction of low-mass subhaloes are completely devoid of stars. Accounting for the presence of dark subhaloes below 10{\textasciicircum}10 solar masses further reduces the abundance of observable objects, and leads to an additional increase in the inferred stellar-to-total mass ratio by factors of 2 - 10 for galaxies in haloes of 10{\textasciicircum}9 - 10{\textasciicircum}10 solar masses. This largely reconciles the abundance matching results with the kinematics of individual dwarf galaxies in Lambda-{CDM}. We propose approximate corrections to the masses of objects derived from pure dark matter calculations to account for baryonic effects.},

We use a sample of five \$z\$ \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 1-2 galaxy counterparts to Damped Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ Absorbers ({DLAs}) to combine data on cold gas, metals and stellar content of the same galaxies. We present new {HST}/{WFC}3 imaging of these fields in 3-5 broadband filters and characterise the stellar properties of the host galaxies. By fitting the spectral energy distribution, we measure their stellar masses to be in the range of log(\$M\_*\$/\${\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 9.1\$-\$10.7. Combining these with {IFU} observations, we find a large spread of baryon fractions inside the host galaxies, between 7 and 100 percent. Similarly, we find gas fractions between 3 and 56 percent. Given their star formation rates, these objects lie on the expected main sequence of galaxies. Emission line metallicities indicate they are consistent with the mass-metallicity relation for {DLAs}. We also report an apparent anti-correlation between the stellar masses and \$N\$({HI}), which could be due to a dust bias effect or lower column density systems tracing more massive galaxies.

	abstract = {The high ionization-state ions trace the hot gases in the universe, of which gaseous halos around galaxies are a major contributor. Following Qu \& Bregman (2018), we calculate the gaseous halo contribution to the observed column density distributions for these ions by convolving the gaseous halo model with the observed stellar mass function. The predicted column density distribution reproduces the general shape of the observed column density distribution -- a broken power law with the break point at \${\textbackslash}log N=14.0\$ for \{{\textbackslash}{OVI}\}. Our modeling suggests that the high column density systems originate from galaxies for which the virial temperature matches the temperature of the ionization fraction peak. Specifically, this mass range is \${\textbackslash}log M\_{\textbackslash}star=8.5-10\$ for \{{\textbackslash}{OVI}\}, \${\textbackslash}log M\_{\textbackslash}star=9.5-10.5\$ for \{{\textbackslash}{NeVIII}\}, and higher for higher ionization state ions (assuming \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}=2T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$). A comparison with the observed \{{\textbackslash}{OVI}\} column density distribution prefers a large radius model, where the maximum radius is twice the virial radius. This model may be in conflict with the more poorly defined \{{\textbackslash}{NeVIII}\} column density distribution, suggesting further observations are warranted. The redshift evolution of the high column density systems is dominated by the change of the cosmic star formation rate, which decreases from \$z=1.0\$ to the local universe. Some differences at lower columns between our models and observations indicate that absorption by the intra-group (cluster) medium and intergalactic medium are also contributors to the total column density distributions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00741},
	abstract = {Successful models of the low redshift circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) must account for (1) a large amount of gas, (2) relatively slow gas velocities, (3) a high degree of metal enrichment, (4) the similar absorption properties around both star-forming and passive galaxies, and (5) the observationally inferred temperature and densities of the {CGM} gas. We show that galactic wind-driven bubbles can account for these observed properties. We develop a model describing the motion of bubbles driven by a hot, fast galactic wind characteristic of supernova energy injection. The bubble size grows slowly to hundreds of kiloparsecs over \$5-10\$ Gyr. For high star formation rates or high wind mass loading \${\textbackslash}dot M\_w/{\textbackslash}dot M\_{\textbackslash}star\$, the free-flowing hot wind, the shocked hot wind in the interior of the bubble, and the swept-up halo gas within the bubble shell can all radiatively cool and contribute to low-ionization state metal line absorption. We verify that if the free-flowing wind cools, the shocked wind does as well. We find effective mass loading factors of \$(M\_w+M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{swept\})/M\_{\textbackslash}star{\textbackslash}sim5-12\$ as the bubbles sweep into the {CGM}.

	abstract = {We investigate the physics that drives the gas accretion rates onto galaxies at the centers of dark matter haloes using the {EAGLE} suite of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. We find that at redshifts \$z\{{\textbackslash}le\}2\$ the accretion rate onto the galaxy increases with halo mass in the halo mass range \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{11.7\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, flattens between the halo masses \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11.7\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{12.7\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, and increases again for higher-mass haloes. However, the galaxy gas accretion does not flatten at intermediate halo masses when {AGN} feedback is switched off. To better understand these trends, we develop a physically motivated semi-analytic model of galaxy gas accretion. We show that the flattening is produced by the rate of gas cooling from the hot halo. The ratio of the cooling radius and the virial radius does not decrease continuously with increasing halo mass as generally thought. While it decreases up to \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ haloes, it increases for higher halo masses, causing an upturn in the galaxy gas accretion rate. This may indicate that in high-mass haloes {AGN} feedback is not sufficiently efficient. When there is no {AGN} feedback, the density of the hot halo is higher, the ratio of the cooling and virial radii does not decrease as much and the cooling rate is higher. Changes in the efficiency of stellar feedback can also increase or decrease the accretion rates onto galaxies. The trends can plausibly be explained by the re-accretion of gas ejected by progenitor galaxies and by the suppression of black hole growth, and hence {AGN} feedback, by stellar feedback.},

	abstract = {The similarity between the distributions of spins for galaxies (\${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}rm g\}\$) and for dark-matter haloes (\${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$), indicated both by simulations and observations, is naively interpreted as a one-to-one correlation between the spins of a galaxy and its host halo. This is used to predict galaxy sizes in semi-analytic models via \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}{\textbackslash}simeq{\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\} R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm v\}\$, with \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}\$ the half-mass radius of the galaxy and \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm v\}\$ the halo radius. Utilizing two different suites of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we find that \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}rm g\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$ are in fact only barely correlated, especially at \$z{\textbackslash}geq 1\$. A general smearing of this correlation is expected based on the different spin histories, where the more recently accreted baryons through streams gain and then lose significant angular momentum compared to the gradually accumulated dark matter. Expecting the spins of baryons and dark matter to be correlated at accretion into \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm v\}\$, the null correlation at the end reflects an anti-correlation between \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}rm g\}/{\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$, which can partly arise from mergers and a compact star-forming phase that many galaxies undergo. On the other hand, the halo and galaxy spin vectors tend to be aligned, with a median \${\textbackslash}cos{\textbackslash}theta=0.6\$-0.7 between galaxy and halo, consistent with instreaming within a preferred plane. The galaxy spin is better correlated with the spin of the inner halo, but this largely reflects the effect of the baryons on the halo. Following the null spin correlation, \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$ is not a useful proxy for \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}\$. While our simulations reproduce a general relation of the sort \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}={AR}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$, in agreement with observational estimates, the relation becomes tighter with \$A=0.02(c/10){\textasciicircum}\{-0.7\}\$, where \$c\$ is the halo concentration, which in turn introduces a dependence on mass and redshift.},

We study their origin by analysing similar features arising in an N-body simulation of a Galactic disc interacting with a Sagittarius-like dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr). By following the orbits of the particles identified as contributing to feathers backwards in time, we trace their excitation to one of Sgr's previous pericentric passages. These particles initially span a large range of phase-angles but a tight range of radii, suggesting they provide a probe of populations in distinct annuli in the outer Galactic disc. The structures are long lived and persist after multiple passages on timescales of \${\textbackslash}sim4 {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm\{Gyrs\}\$. On the sky, they exhibit oscillatory motion that can be traced with a single orbit mapped over much of their full length and with amplitudes and gradients similar to those observed. We demonstrate how these properties of feathers may be exploited to measure the potential, its flattening, as well as infer the strength of recent potential perturbations.},

Finally, we discuss the prospects of statistical tools such as the 2PCF in the Gaia era of galactic archaeology.},

Each of these halos hosts more than one million particles within their virial radii Rvir. We use {MHT} as well as {MHF} to follow the temporal evolution of hundreds of individual satellites, and show that the radial distribution of these substructure satellites follows a "universal" radial distribution irrespective of the host halo's environment and formation history. This in fact might pose another problem for simulations of {CDM} structure formation as there are recent findings by Taylor et al. (2003) that the Milky Way satellites are found preferentially closer to the galactic centre and simulations underestimate the amount of central substructure, respectively. Further, this universal substructure profile is anti-biased with respect to the underlying dark matter profile.

One possible scenario is that gas is heated over large scales by feedback from active galactic nuclei ({AGN}), leading to coherent modulation of cooling and star formation between well-separated galaxies. In this Letter, the metal line absorption catalogue of Zhu \& Menard (2013) is used to probe gas out to large projected radii around a sample of a million galaxies with stellar masses {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} M\_\{sun\} and photometric redshifts in the range 0.4{\textless}z{\textless}0.8 selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging data. This galaxy sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc{\textasciicircum}3. A statistically significant excess of {MgII} absorbers is present around the red low mass galaxies compared to their blue counterparts out to projected radii of 10 Mpc. In addition, the equivalent width distribution function of {MgII} absorbers around low mass galaxies is shown to be strongly affected by the presence of a nearby (R\_p{\textless}2 Mpc) radio-loud {AGN} out to projected radii of 5 Mpc.},

Clustering is evaluated in two dimensions, by binning absorbers both in projected radius and in velocity separation. Excess {MgII} is detected around massive galaxies out to R\_p=20 Mpc. At projected radii less than 800 kpc, the excess extends out to velocity separations of 10,000 km/s. The extent of the high velocity tail within this radius is independent of the mean stellar age of the galaxy and whether or not it harbours an active galactic nucleus. We interpret our results using the publicly available Illustris and Millennium simulations. Models where the {MgII} absorbers trace the dark matter particle or subhalo distributions do not fit the data. They overpredict the clustering on small scales and do not reproduce the excess high velocity separation {MgII} absorbers seen within the virial radius of the halo. The Illustris simulations which include thermal, but not mechanical feedback from {AGN}, also do not provide an adequate fit to the properties of the cool halo gas within the virial radius. We propose that the large velocity separation {MgII} absorbers trace gas that has been pushed out of the dark matter halos, possibly by multiple episodes of {AGN}-driven mechanical feedback acting over long timescales.},

The purpose of tracer particles is to allow the flow to be followed in a Lagrangian way, tracing the evolution of the fluid with time, and allowing the thermodynamical history of individual fluid parcels to be recorded. We find that the commonly-used `velocity field tracers', which are advected using the fluid velocity field, do not in general follow the mass flow correctly, and explain why this is the case. This method can result in orders-of-magnitude biases in simulations of driven turbulence and in cosmological simulations, rendering the velocity field tracers inappropriate for following these flows. We then discuss a novel implementation of `Monte Carlo tracers', which are moved along with fluid cells, and are exchanged probabilistically between them following the mass flux. This method reproduces the mass distribution of the fluid correctly. The main limitation of this approach is that it is more diffusive than the fluid itself. Nonetheless, we show that this novel approach is more reliable than what has been employed previously and demonstrate that it is appropriate for following hydrodynamical flows in mesh-based codes. The Monte Carlo tracers can also naturally be transferred between fluid cells and other types of particles, such as stellar particles, so that the mass flow in cosmological simulations can be followed in its entirety.},

We performed bulge-disc decompositions of the galaxies using artificial observations, in order to conduct a fair comparison to observations. We also dynamically decomposed the galaxies and compared the star formation histories of the bulges to those of the entire galaxies. These star formation histories showed that the bulges were primarily formed before z = 1 and during periods of rapid star formation. Both galaxies have large amounts of early star formation, which is likely related to the relatively high bulge-to-disc ratios also measured for them. Unlike almost all previous cosmological simulations, the realistically concentrated bulges of these galaxies do not lead to unphysically high rotational velocities, causing them to naturally lie along the observed Tully-Fisher relation.},

To do so, we compare two simulations -- with and without feedback -- both evolved with the moving mesh code {AREPO}. The feedback runs implement the full physics model of the Illustris simulation project, including star formation driven galactic winds and energetic feedback from supermassive blackholes. We explore: (a) the accretion rate of material contributing to the net growth of galaxies and originating directly from the intergalactic medium, finding that feedback strongly suppresses the raw, as well as the net, inflow of this "smooth mode" gas at all redshifts, regardless of the temperature history of newly acquired gas. (b) At the virial radius the temperature and radial flux of inflowing gas is largely unaffected at z=2. However, the spherical covering fraction of inflowing gas at 0.25 rvir decreases substantially, from more than 80\% to less than 50\%, while the rates of both inflow and outflow increase, indicative of recycling across this boundary. (c) The fractional contribution of smooth accretion to the total accretion rate is lower in the simulation with feedback, by roughly a factor of two across all redshifts. Moreover, the smooth component of gas with a cold temperature history, is entirely suppressed in the feedback run at z{\textless}1. (d) The amount of time taken by gas to cross from the virial radius to the galaxy -- the "halo transit time" -- increases in the presence of feedback by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2-3, and is notably independent of halo mass.

When extrapolated to R200, the gas mass is comparable to the stellar mass, but about half of the baryons are still missing from the hot phase.

Significantly flatter density profiles are unlikely for R {\textless} 50 kpc and they are disfavored but not ruled out for R {\textgreater} 50 kpc. For the Milky Way, the hot halo metallicity lies in the range 0.3-1 solar for R {\textless} 50 kpc. Planck measurements of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect toward stacked luminous galaxies (primarily early-type) indicate that most of their baryons are hot, near the virial temperature, and extend beyond R200. This stacked {SZ} signal is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that inferred from the X-ray observations of individual (mostly spiral) galaxies with M\_* {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}11.3 Msun. This difference suggests that the hot halo properties are distinct for early and late type galaxies, possibly due to different evolutionary histories. For the cooler gas detected in {UV} absorption line studies, we argue that there are two absorption populations: extended halos; and disks extending to {\textasciitilde}50 kpc, containing most of this gas, and with masses a few times lower than the stellar masses.

	abstract = {As part of our long-term campaign to understand how cold streams feed massive galaxies at high redshift, we study the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability ({KHI}) of a supersonic, cold, dense gas stream as it penetrates through a hot, dilute circumgalactic medium ({CGM}). A linear analysis (Paper I) showed that, for realistic conditions, {KHI} may produce nonlinear perturbations to the stream during infall. Therefore, we proceed here to study the nonlinear stage of {KHI}, still limited to a two-dimensional slab with no radiative cooling or gravity. Using analytic models and numerical simulations, we examine stream breakup, deceleration and heating via surface modes and body modes. The relevant parameters are the density contrast between stream and {CGM} (\${\textbackslash}delta\$), the Mach number of the stream velocity with respect to the {CGM} (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\}\$) and the stream radius relative to the halo virial radius (\$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}/R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm v\}\$). We find that sufficiently thin streams disintegrate prior to reaching the central galaxy.

While individual clouds have previously been found in the region between M31 and M33, the covering factor of strongly optically-thick gas is quite small. Our upper limits on the covering factor are consistent with expectations from recent cosmological "zoom" simulations. Recent {COS}-Halos ultraviolet measurements of {\textbackslash}{HI}{\textbackslash} absorption about an ensemble of galaxies at \$z {\textbackslash}approx 0.2\$ show significantly higher covering factors within \${\textbackslash}rho {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.5 R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$ at the same \$N(\{{\textbackslash}rm H I\})\$, although the metal ion-to-H I ratios appear to be consistent with those seen in M31.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05445},
	abstract = {The evolution of galaxies is governed by equations with chaotic solutions: gravity and compressible hydrodynamics. While this micro-scale chaos and stochasticity has been well studied, it is poorly understood how it couples to macro-scale properties examined in simulations of galaxy formation. In this paper, we show how perturbations introduced by floating-point roundoff, random number generators, and seemingly trivial differences in algorithmic behaviour can produce non-trivial differences in star formation histories, circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) properties, and the distribution of stellar mass. We examine the importance of stochasticity due to discreteness noise, variations in merger timings and how self-regulation moderates the effects of this stochasticity. We show that chaotic variations in stellar mass can grow until halted by feedback-driven self-regulation or gas exhaustion. We also find that galaxy mergers are critical points from which large (as much as a factor of 2) variations in quantities such as the galaxy stellar mass can grow. These variations can grow and persist for more than a Gyr before regressing towards the mean. These results show that detailed comparisons of simulations require serious consideration of the magnitude of effects compared to run-to-run chaotic variation, and may significantly complicate interpreting the impact of different physical models. Understanding the results of simulations requires us to understand that the process of simulation is not a mapping of an infinitesimal point in configuration space to another, final infinitesimal point. Instead, simulations map a point in a space of possible initial conditions points to a volume of possible final states.},

	abstract = {Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array, we have detected {CO}(3-2) line and far-infrared continuum emission from a galaxy associated with a high-metallicity ([M/H] = -0.27) damped Ly-alpha absorber ({DLA}) at z =2.19289. The galaxy is located 3.5" away from the quasar sightline, corresponding to a large impact parameter of 30 kpc at the {DLA} redshift. We use archival Very Large Telescope-{SINFONI} data to detect Halpha emission from the associated galaxy, and find that the object is dusty, with a dust-corrected star formation rate of 110 +60 -30 Msun/yr. The galaxy's molecular mass is large, Mmol = (1.4 +- 0.2) x 10{\textasciicircum}11 x ({\textbackslash}alpha\_CO/4.3) x (0.57/r\_31) Msun, supporting the hypothesis that high-metallicity {DLAs} arise predominantly near massive galaxies. The excellent agreement in redshift between the {CO}(3-2) line emission and low-ion metal absorption ({\textasciitilde}40 km/s) disfavors scenarios whereby the gas probed by the {DLA} shows bulk motion around the galaxy. We use Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope {HI} 21cm absorption spectroscopy to find that the {HI} along the {DLA} sightline must be warm, with a stringent lower limit on the spin temperature of T\_s {\textgreater} 1895 x (f/0.93) K. The detection of {CI} absorption in the {DLA}, however, also indicates the presence of cold neutral gas. To reconcile these results requires that the cold components in the {DLA} contribute little to the {HI} column density, yet contain roughly 50\% of the metals of the absorber, underlining the complex multi-phase nature of the gas surrounding high-z galaxies.},

	abstract = {Abundant observational evidence indicates that the cooling time t\_cool of the hot ambient medium pervading a massive galaxy does not drop much below 10 times the freefall time t\_ff at any radius. Theoretical models have accounted for this finding by hypothesizing that cold clouds start to condense out of the ambient medium when t\_cool/t\_ff {\textless} 10 and fuel a strong black-hole feedback response that reheats the ambient gas, but those models have not yet been able to provide a simple explanation for the origin of the critical t\_cool/t\_ff ratio. This paper explores a heuristic model for condensation that links the critical ratio to turbulent driving of gravity-wave oscillations. In the linear regime, internal gravity waves are thermally unstable in a thermally balanced medium. Buoyancy oscillations in a balanced medium with t\_cool/t\_ff therefore grow until they saturate without condensing at an amplitude that depends on t\_cool/t\_ff. However, in a medium with 10 {\textless} t\_cool/t\_ff {\textless} 20, turbulence with a velocity dispersion roughly half the galaxy's stellar velocity dispersion can drive those oscillations into condensation. Intriguingly, this is indeed the gas-phase velocity dispersion observed among galaxy-cluster cores that contain multiphase gas. It is therefore possible that both the critical t\_cool/t\_ff ratio for condensation of ambient gas and the level of turbulence in that gas are determined by coupling between condensation, feedback, and turbulence. Such a system can converge to a well-regulated equilibrium state, as long as the fraction of feedback energy that goes into turbulence is significantly less than the fraction that goes more directly into heat.},

While state-of-the art simulations excel at reproducing galactic disk properties, many struggle to drive strong galactic winds or to match the observed ionization structure of the {CGM} using only thermal supernova feedback. To remedy this, recent studies have invoked non-thermal cosmic ray ({CR}) stellar feedback prescriptions. However, numerical schemes of {CR} transport are still poorly constrained. We explore how the choice of {CR} transport affects the multiphase structure of the simulated {CGM}. We implement anisotropic {CR} physics in the astrophysical simulation code, \{{\textbackslash}sc Enzo\} and simulate a suite of isolated disk galaxies with varying prescriptions for {CR} transport: isotropic diffusion, anisotropic diffusion, and streaming. We find that all three transport mechanisms result in strong, metal-rich outflows but differ in the temperature and ionization structure of their {CGM}. Isotropic diffusion results in a spatially uniform, warm {CGM} that underpredicts the column densities of low-ions. Anisotropic diffusion develops a reservoir of cool gas that extends further from the galactic center, but disperses rapidly with distance. {CR} streaming projects cool gas out to radii of 200 kpc, supporting a truly multiphase medium. In addition, we find that streaming is less sensitive to changes in constant parameter values like the {CR} injection fraction, transport velocity, and resolution than diffusion. We conclude that {CR} streaming is a more robust implementation of {CR} transport and motivate the need for detailed parameter studies of {CR} transport.},

	abstract = {Using {VIMOS}-{IFU} observations, we study the interstellar medium ({ISM}) of two star-forming dwarf galaxies, {UM} 461 and Mrk 600. Our aim was to search for the existence of metallicity inhomogeneities that might arise from infall of nearly pristine gas feeding ongoing localized star-formation. The {IFU} data allowed us to study the impact of external gas accretion on the chemical evolution as well as the ionised gas kinematics and morphologies of these galaxies. Both systems show signs of morphological distortions, including cometary-like morphologies. We analysed the spatial variation of 12 + log(O/H) abundances within both galaxies using the direct method (T\_e), the widely applied {HII}-{CHI}-mistry code, as well as by employing different standard calibrations. For {UM} 461 our results show that the {ISM} is fairly well mixed, at large scales, however we find an off-centre and low-metallicity region with 12 + log(O/H) {\textless} 7.6 in the {SW} part of the brightest {HII} region, using the direct method. This result is consistent with the recent infall of a low mass metal-poor dwarf or {HI} cloud into the region now exhibiting the lowest metallicity, which also displays localized perturbed neutral and ionized gas kinematics. Mrk 600 in contrast, appears to be chemically homogeneous on both large and small scales. The intrinsic differences in the spatially resolved properties of the {ISM} in our analysed galaxies are consistent with these systems being at different evolutionary stages.},

	abstract = {We present results from analysis of deep Herschel Space Observatory observations of six nearby dwarf galaxies known to host galactic-scale winds. The superior far-infrared sensitivity and angular resolution of Herschel have allowed detection of cold circumgalactic dust features beyond the stellar components of the host galaxies traced by Spitzer 4.5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m images. Comparisons of these cold dust features with ancillary data reveal an imperfect spatial correlation with the ionized gas and warm dust wind components. We find that typically \${\textbackslash}sim\$10-20{\textbackslash}\% of the total dust mass in these galaxies resides outside of their stellar disks, but this fraction reaches \${\textbackslash}sim\$60{\textbackslash}\% in the case of {NGC} 1569. This galaxy also has the largest metallicity (O/H) deficit in our sample for its stellar mass. Overall, the small number of objects in our sample precludes drawing strong conclusions on the origin of the circumgalactic dust. We detect no statistically significant trends with star formation properties of the host galaxies, as might be expected if the dust were lifted above the disk by energy inputs from on-going star formation activity. Although a case for dust entrained in a galactic wind is seen in {NGC} 1569, in all cases, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the circumgalactic dust might be associated instead with gas accreted or removed from the disk by recent galaxy interaction events, or that it is part of the outer gas-rich portion of the disk that lies below the sensitivity limit of the Spitzer 4.5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m data.},

The {SA} cooling models are the new cooling model introduced in Hou et al. (2017), along with two earlier {GALFORM} cooling models and the cooling models in the L-{GALAXIES} and {MORGANA} {SA} galaxy formation models. We find that the predictions of the new cooling model generally agree the best with the simulations. For halos with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}{\textbackslash}lesssim 3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ , the {SA} models predict that radiative cooling is faster than gravitational infall. Even though {SA} models assume that gas falls onto galaxies from a spherical gas halo, while the simulations show that the cold gas is accreted through non-spherical filaments, both methods predict similar mass cooling rates, because in both cases the gas accretion onto galaxies is limited by the gravitational infall timescale. For halos with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ , gas in the simulations typically cools from a roughly spherical hot gas halo, as assumed in the {SA} models, but the halo gas only gradually contracts during cooling, leading to compressional heating. {SA} models ignore this compressional heating, and so overestimate mass cooling rates by factors of a few. At low redshifts halo major mergers or a sequence of successive smaller mergers are seen in the simulations to strongly heat the hot gas halo and suppress cooling, while mergers at high redshifts do not suppress cooling, because the gas filaments are difficult to heat up. The new {SA} cooling model best captures these effects of halo mergers.},

The radiation from a luminous quasar produces a spatially extended emission halo resulting from Thomson scattering off of free electrons in the {CGM}, which can be used to measure the electron density profile, and therefore, the amount of warm and hot baryonic matter present. We predict the resulting surface brightness profiles and show that they are easily detectable in a three hour integration with the James Webb Space Telescope ({JWST}), out to \${\textbackslash}sim 100\$ physical kpc from the centers of individual hyper-luminous quasars. This electron scattering surface brightness is redshift independent, and the signal-to-noise ratio depends only very weakly on redshift, in principle allowing measurements of the warm and hot {CGM} into the Epoch of Reionization at \$z{\textbackslash}sim 6.5\$. We consider a litany of potential contaminants, and find that for fainter quasars at \$z{\textbackslash}lesssim1\$, extended stellar halos might be of comparable surface brightness. At \$z{\textgreater}2\$, {JWST} mid-{IR} observations start to probe rest-frame optical/{UV} wavelengths implying that scattering by dust grains in the {CGM} becomes significant, although multi-color observations should be able to distinguish these scenarios given that Thomson scattering is achromatic.},

	abstract = {Galactic outflows commonly contain multiphase gas, and its physical origin requires explanation. Using the {CGOLS} (Cholla Galactic {OutfLow} Simulations) suite of high-resolution isolated galaxy models, we demonstrate the viability of rapid radiative cooling as a source of fast-moving (\$v {\textbackslash}sim 1000\$ km/s), cool (\$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ K) gas observed in absorption line studies of outflows around some star-forming galaxies. By varying the mass-loading and geometry of the simulated winds, we identify a region of parameter space that leads to cool gas in outflows. In particular, when using an analytically-motivated central feedback model, we find that cooling flows can be produced with reasonable mass-loading rates (\${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{wind\} / {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{SFR}\} {\textbackslash}sim 0.5\$), provided the star formation rate surface density is high. When a more realistic clustered feedback model is applied, destruction of high density clouds near the disk and interactions between different outflow regions indicate that lower mass-loading rates of the hot gas within the feedback region may still produce multiphase outflows. These results suggest an origin for fast-moving cool gas in outflows that does not rely on directly accelerating cool gas from the interstellar medium. These cooling flows may additionally provide an explanation for the multiphase gas ubiquitously observed in the halos of star-forming galaxies at low redshift.},

Tangos is a generic solution to this information organization problem, aiming to free users from the details of data management. At the querying stage, our example of gathering properties over history is reduced to a few clicks or a simple, single-line Python command. The framework is highly extensible; in particular, users are expected to define their own properties which tangos will write into the database. A variety of parallelization options are available and the raw simulation data can be read using existing libraries such as pynbody or yt.

Simulations indicate that a significant fraction of these "missing baryons" may be stored in a hot tenuous circum-galactic medium ({CGM}) around massive galaxies extending to or even beyond the virial radius of their dark matter halos. Previous observations in X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ({SZ}) signal claimed that \${\textbackslash}sim(1-50){\textbackslash}\%\$ of the expected baryons are stored in a hot {CGM} within the virial radius. The large scatter is mainly caused by the very uncertain extrapolation of the hot gas density profile based on the detection in a small radial range (typically within 10{\textbackslash}\%-20{\textbackslash}\% of the virial radius). Here we report stacking X-ray observations of six local isolated massive spiral galaxies from the {CGM}-{MASS} sample. We find that the mean density profile can be characterized by a single power law out to a galactocentric radius of \${\textbackslash}approx 200{\textbackslash}rm{\textasciitilde}kpc\$ (or \${\textbackslash}approx130{\textbackslash}rm{\textasciitilde}kpc\$ above the 1{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ background uncertainty), about half the virial radius of the dark matter halo.

According to the spatially resolved star formation history, this component was formed {\textless}6x10{\textasciicircum}8 yr ago. 3) It has many large and elongated {HII} regions that are indication of a fragmentation due to disk instability. 4) The stellar and gas kinematics are quite symmetric around the same axis, but in the gas the locus of negative velocities shows a convexity toward East, as if new gas has been infalling with different orientation and velocity. 5) The metallicity distribution is inhomogeneous and shows exceptionally steep gradients from the center toward the outskirts, especially in the South-West side. 6) The luminosity weighted age is generally low ({\textasciitilde}8 Gyr) and particularly low ({\textless}7 Gyr) along a trail crossing the galaxy from South-West toward North. It might trace the path of the accreted gas. These findings point to an inflow of gas probably proceeding from the South-West side of the galaxy.},

	abstract = {To investigate the evolution of dust in a cosmological volume, we perform hydrodynamic simulations, in which the enrichment of metals and dust is treated self-consistently with star formation and stellar feedback. We consider dust evolution driven by dust production in stellar ejecta, dust destruction by sputtering, grain growth by accretion and coagulation, and grain disruption by shattering, and treat small and large grains separately to trace the grain size distribution. After confirming that our model nicely reproduces the observed relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity for nearby galaxies, we concentrate on the dust abundance over the cosmological volume in this paper. The comoving dust mass density has a peak at redshift \$z{\textbackslash}sim 1\$-\$2\$, coincident with the observationally suggested dustiest epoch in the Universe. Throughout the history of the Universe, roughly 10 per cent of the dust is contained in the intergalactic medium ({IGM}), where only 1/3-1/4 of the dust survives against dust destruction by sputtering. We also show that the dust mass function is roughly reproduced at galactic dust mass \${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}8\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, while the massive end still has a discrepancy, which indicates the necessity of improving the feedback model. In addition, our model broadly reproduces the observed radial profile of dust surface density in the circum-galactic medium ({CGM}). While our model satisfies the observational constraints for the dust extinction over the cosmological distance, it predicts that the dust in the {CGM} and {IGM} is dominated by large (\${\textgreater} 0.03{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu\$m) grains, which is in tension with the observed steep reddening curves in the {CGM}.},

	volume = {000},
	abstract = {We introduce an updated physical model to simulate the formation and evolution of galaxies in cosmological, large-scale gravity+magnetohydrodynamical simulations with the moving mesh code {AREPO}. The overall framework builds upon the successes of the Illustris galaxy formation model, and includes prescriptions for star formation, stellar evolution, chemical enrichment, primordial and metal-line cooling of the gas, stellar feedback with galactic out-flows, and black hole formation, growth and multi-mode feedback. In this paper we give a comprehensive description of the physical and numerical advances which form the core of the {IllustrisTNG} (The Next Generation) framework. We focus on the revised implementation of the galactic winds, of which we modify the directionality, velocity, thermal content, and en-ergy scalings, and explore its effects on the galaxy population. As described in earlier works, the model also includes a new black hole driven kinetic feedback at low accretion rates, mag-netohydrodynamics, and improvements to the numerical scheme. Using a suite of (25 Mpc h −1) 3 cosmological boxes we assess the outcome of the new model at our fiducial resolution. The presence of a self-consistently amplified magnetic field is shown to have an important impact on the stellar content of 10 12 M haloes and above. Finally, we demonstrate that the new galactic winds promise to solve key problems identified in Illustris in matching observa-tional constraints and affecting the stellar content and sizes of the low mass end of the galaxy population.},

	abstract = {The {IllustrisTNG} project is a new suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation performed with the Arepo code and updated models for feedback physics. Here we introduce the first two simulations of the series, {TNG}100 and {TNG}300, and quantify the stellar mass content of about 4000 massive galaxy groups and clusters (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} {\textbackslash}leq M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 200c\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sun\} {\textbackslash}leq 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}\$) at recent times (\$z {\textbackslash}leq 1\$). The richest clusters have half of their total stellar mass bound to satellite galaxies, with the other half being associated with the central galaxy and the diffuse intra-cluster light. The exact {ICL} fraction depends sensitively on the definition of a central galaxy's mass and varies in our most massive clusters between 20 to 40\% of the total stellar mass. Haloes of \$5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sun\}\$ and above have more diffuse stellar mass outside 100 kpc than within 100 kpc, with power-law slopes of the radial mass density distribution as shallow as the dark matter's ( \$-3.5 {\textless} {\textbackslash}alpha\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 3D\} {\textless} -3\$). Total halo mass is a very good predictor of stellar mass, and vice versa: at \$z=0\$, the 3D stellar mass measured within 30 kpc scales as \${\textbackslash}propto (M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 500c\}){\textasciicircum}\{0.49\}\$ with a \${\textbackslash}sim 0.12\$ dex scatter. This is possibly too steep in comparison to the available observational constraints, even though the abundance of {TNG} less massive galaxies (\${\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sun\}\$ in stars) is in good agreement with the measured galaxy stellar mass functions at recent epochs. The 3D sizes of massive galaxies fall too on a tight (\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.16 dex scatter) power-law relation with halo mass, with \$r{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm stars\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 0.5\} {\textbackslash}propto (M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 500c\}){\textasciicircum}\{0.53\}\$. Even more fundamentally, halo mass alone is a good predictor for the whole stellar mass profiles beyond the inner few kpc, and we show how on average these can be precisely recovered given a single mass measurement of the galaxy or its halo.},

Modeling the ionization states of simulated oxygen, we find good agreement with observations of the low-redshift {OVI} column density distribution function ({CDDF}), and present its evolution for all three ions from z=0 to z=4. Producing mock quasar absorption line spectral surveys, we show that the {IllustrisTNG} simulations are fully consistent with constraints on the {OVI} content of the {CGM} from {COS}-Halos and other low redshift observations, producing columns as high as observed. We measure the total amount of mass and average column densities of each ion using hundreds of thousands of simulated galaxies spanning 10{\textasciicircum}11 {\textless} Mhalo/Msun {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}15 corresponding to 10{\textasciicircum}9 {\textless} M*/Msun {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}12 in stellar mass. The stacked radial profiles of {OVI} around halos of different masses are computed in 3D number density as well as 2D projected column, decomposing into the 1-halo and 2-halo terms, the latter of which begins to dominate for Milky Way mass halos in the {WHIM} just beyond the virial radius. Relating halo {OVI} to properties of the central galaxy, we find a correlation between the (g-r) color of a galaxy and the total amount of {OVI} in its {CGM}. In comparison to the {COS}-Halos finding, this leads to a dichotomy of columns around star-forming versus passive galaxies at fixed stellar (or halo) mass. We demonstrate that this correlation is a direct result of blackhole feedback associated with quenching, which also produces additional trends with other galaxy properties, and represents a causal consequence of galactic-scale baryonic feedback impacting the physical state of the circumgalactic medium.},

Clusters (M\_200{\textgreater}=10{\textasciicircum}14 Msol) reproduce previous results with thermal pressure responsible for {\textasciitilde}90\% of the support against gravity, but this fraction drops for group-sized haloes (M\_200{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}13 Msol) and is even lower (40-70\%) for L* haloes between 0.1-0.3 R\_200. Energy from feedback grows relative to the binding energy of a halo toward lower mass resulting in greater deviations from {HSE}. Tangential motions comprise the largest deviation from {HSE} in L* haloes indicating that the hot circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) has significant sub- centrifugal rotation and angular momentum spin parameters 2-3x higher than the dark matter spin parameters. Thermal feedback can buoyantly rise to the outer {CGM} of M\_200{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}12 Msol haloes, both moving baryons beyond R\_200 and feeding uncorrelated tangential motions. The resulting hot halo density and rotation profiles show promising agreement with X-ray observations of the inner Milky Way halo, and we discuss future observational prospects to detect spinning hot haloes around other galaxies. Acceleration and radial streaming motions also comprise significant deviations from {HSE}, especially net outward accelerations seen in L* and group haloes indicating active feedback. Black hole feedback acts in a preventative manner during the later growth of group haloes, applying significant accelerations via shocks that do not feed tangential motions. We argue that {HSE} is a poor assumption for the {CGM}, especially in the inner regions, and rotating baryonic hot haloes are a critical consideration for analytic models of the {CGM}.},

	abstract = {Galaxies are surrounded by sizeable gas reservoirs which host a significant amount of metals: the circum-galactic medium ({CGM}). The {CGM} acts as a mediator between the galaxy and the extra-galactic medium. However, our understanding of how galaxy mergers, a major evolutionary transformation, impact the {CGM} remains deficient. We present a theoretical study of the effect of galaxy mergers on the {CGM}. We use hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations of a major merger selected from the Illustris project such that the z=0 descendant has a halo mass and stellar mass comparable to the Milky Way. To study the {CGM} we then re-simulated this system at a 40 times better mass resolution, and included detailed post-processing ionization modelling. Our work demonstrates the effect the merger has on the characteristic size of the {CGM}, its metallicity, and the predicted covering fraction of various commonly observed gas-phase species, such as H I, C {IV}, and O {VI}. We show that merger-induced outflows can increase the {CGM} metallicity by 0.2-0.3 dex within 0.5 Gyr post-merger. These effects last up to 6 Gyr post-merger. While the merger increases the total metal covering fractions by factors of 2-3, the covering fractions of commonly observed {UV} ions decrease due to the hard ionizing radiation from the active galactic nucleus, which we model explicitly. Our study of the single simulated major merger presented in this work demonstrates the significant impact that a galaxy interaction can have on the size, metallicity, and observed column densities of the {CGM}.},

	abstract = {Understanding the origin of strong galactic outflows and the suppression of star formation in dwarf galaxies is a key problem in galaxy formation. Using a set of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of an isolated dwarf galaxy embedded in a \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ halo, we show that the momentum transferred from resonantly scattered Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ (Lya) photons is an important source of stellar feedback which can shape the evolution of galaxies. We find that Lya feedback suppresses star formation by a factor of two in metal-poor galaxies by regulating the dynamics of star-forming clouds before the onset of supernova explosions ({SNe}). This is possible because each Lya photon resonantly scatters and imparts 10-300 times greater momentum than in the single scattering limit. Consequently, the number of star clusters predicted in the simulations is reduced by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 5\$, compared to the model without the early feedback. More importantly, we find that galactic outflows become weaker in the presence of strong Lya radiation feedback, as star formation and associated {SNe} become less bursty. We also examine a model in which radiation field is arbitrarily enhanced by a factor of up to 10, and reach the same conclusion. The typical mass loading factors in our metal-poor dwarf system are estimated to be \${\textbackslash}sim5-10\$ near the mid plane, while it is reduced to \${\textbackslash}sim1\$ at larger radii. Finally, we find that the escape of ionizing radiation and hence the reionization history of the Universe is unlikely to be strongly affected by Lya feedback.},

In this contribution we first summarize the physical mechanisms by which the momentum and energy output from a population of massive stars and associated supernovae can drive galactic winds. We use the proto-typical example of M82 to illustrate the multiphase nature of galactic winds. We then describe how the basic properties of galactic winds are derived from the data, and summarize how the properties of galactic winds vary systematically with the properties of the galaxies that launch them.

	abstract = {Efficient thermalization of overlapping supernovae within star-forming galaxies may produce a supernova-heated fluid that drives galactic winds. For fiducial assumptions about the timescale for cloud shredding from high-resolution simulations (which neglect magnetic fields) we show that cool clouds with temperature from \$T\_\{c\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{2\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{4\}\$ K seen in emission and absorption in galactic winds cannot be accelerated to observed velocities by the ram pressure of a hot wind. Taking into account both the radial structure of the hot flow and gravity, we show that this conclusion holds over a wide range of galaxy, cloud, and hot wind properties. This finding calls into question the prevailing picture whereby the cool atomic gas seen in galactic winds is entrained and accelerated by the hot flow. Given these difficulties with ram pressure acceleration, we discuss alternative models for the origin of high velocity cool gas outflows. Another possibility is that magnetic fields in cool clouds are sufficiently important that they prolong the cloud's life. For \$T\_\{c\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\${\textbackslash},K and \$10{\textasciicircum}\{4\}\${\textbackslash},K clouds, we show that if conductive evaporation can be neglected, the cloud shredding timescale must be \${\textbackslash}sim15\$ and 5 times longer, respectively, than the values from hydrodynamical simulations in order for cool cloud velocities to reach those seen in observations.},

	abstract = {The radiation force on dust grains may be dynamically important in driving turbulence and outflows in rapidly star-forming galaxies. Recent studies focus on the highly optically-thick limit relevant to the densest ultra-luminous galaxies and super star clusters, where reprocessed infrared photons provide the dominant source of electromagnetic momentum. However, even among starburst galaxies, the great majority instead lie in the so-called "single-scattering" limit, where the system is optically-thick to the incident starlight, but optically-thin to the re-radiated infrared. In this paper we present a stability analysis and multidimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations exploring the stability and dynamics of isothermal dusty gas columns in this regime. We describe our algorithm for full angle-dependent radiation transport based on the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. For a range of near-Eddington fluxes, we show that the medium is unstable, producing convective-like motions in a turbulent atmosphere with a scale height significantly inflated compared to the gas pressure scale height and mass-weighted turbulent energy densities of \${\textbackslash}sim 0.01-0.1\$ of the midplane radiation energy density, corresponding to mass-weighted velocity dispersions of Mach number \${\textbackslash}sim 0.5-2\$. Extrapolation of our results to optical depths of \$10{\textasciicircum}3\$ implies maximum turbulent Mach numbers of \${\textbackslash}sim20\$. Comparing our results to galaxy-averaged observations, and subject to the approximations of our calculations, we find that radiation pressure does not contribute significantly to the effective supersonic pressure support in star-forming disks, which in general are substantially sub-Eddington. We further examine the time-averaged vertical density profiles in dynamical equilibrium and comment on implications for radiation-pressure-driven galactic winds.},

These are syntethized by the stellar populations and later ejected into the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) by different mechanism, of which supernova feedback is considered one of the most relevant. We explore the properties of this metal reservoir surrounding star-forming galaxies in a cosmological context aiming to investigate the chemical loop between galaxies and their {CGM}, and the ability of the subgrid models to reproduce observational results. Using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we analyse the gas-phase chemical contents of galaxies with stellar masses in the range \$10{\textasciicircum}\{9\} - 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. We estimate the fractions of metals stored in the different {CGM} phases, and the predicted {OVI} and {SiIII} column densities within the virial radius. We find roughly \$10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ of oxygen in the {CGM} of simulated galaxies having \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\{{\textbackslash}sim\}10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, in fair agreement with the lower limits imposed by observations. The \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm oxy\}\$ is found to correlate with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$, at odds with current observational trends but in agreement with other numerical results. The estimated profiles of {OVI} column density reveal a substantial shortage of that ion, whereas {SiIII}, which probes the cool phase, is overpredicted. The analysis of the relative contributions of both ions from the hot, warm and cool phases suggests that the warm gas (\$ 10{\textasciicircum}5{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm K\} {\textless} T {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}6{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\$) should be more abundant in order to bridge the mismatch with the observations, or alternatively, that more metals should be stored in this gas-phase.

	abstract = {We present a new perturbative approach to "constrained Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ radiative transfer'" ({RT}) through the circum- and inter-galactic medium ({CGM} and {IGM}). We constrain the {HI} content and kinematics of the {CGM} and {IGM} in a physically motivated model, using the galaxy-Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest clustering data from spectroscopic galaxy surveys in {QSO} fields at \$z{\textbackslash}sim2-3\$. This enables us to quantify the impact of the {CGM}/{IGM} on Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission in an observationally constrained, realistic cosmological environment. Our model predicts that the {CGM} and {IGM} at these redshifts transmit \${\textbackslash}approx80{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}\%\$ of Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ photons after having escaped from galaxies. This implies that while the inter-stellar medium primarily regulates Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ escape, the {CGM} has a non-negligible impact on the observed Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line properties and the inferred Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ escape fraction, even at \$z{\textbackslash}sim 2-3\$. Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ scattering in the {CGM} and {IGM} further introduces an environmental dependence in the (apparent) Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ escape fraction, and the observed population of Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emitting galaxies: the {CGM}/{IGM} more strongly suppresses direct Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission from galaxies in overdense regions in the Universe, and redistributes this emission into brighter Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ haloes. The resulting mean surface brightness profile of the Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ haloes is generally found to be a power-law \${\textbackslash}propto r{\textasciicircum}\{-2.4\}\$. Our results demonstrate how (integral field) spectroscopic surveys of galaxies in {QSO} fields constrain circumgalactic Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ {RT}, and we discuss the potential of these models for studying {CGM} physics, reionization and cosmology.},

	title = {The mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars in star-forming galaxies: strong outflow vs variable {IMF}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11135},
	abstract = {We investigate the mass-metallicity relations for the gaseous ({MZRgas}) and stellar components ({MZRstar}) of local star-forming galaxies based on a representative sample from {SDSS} {DR}12. The mass-weighted average stellar metallicities are systematically lower than the gas metallicities. This difference in metallicity increases toward galaxies with lower masses and reaches 0.4-0.8 dex at 10{\textasciicircum}9 Msun (depending on the gas metallicity calibration). As a result, the {MZRstar} is much steeper than the {MZRgas}. The much lower metallicities in stars compared to the gas in low mass galaxies implies dramatic metallicity evolution with suppressed metal enrichment at early times. The aim of this paper is to explain the observed large difference in gas and stellar metallicity and to infer the origin of the mass-metallicity relations. To this end we develop a galactic chemical evolution model accounting for star formation, gas inflow and outflow. By combining the observed mass-metallicity relation for both gas and stellar components to constrain the models, we find that only two scenarios are able to reproduce the observations. Either strong metal outflow or a steep {IMF} slope at early epochs of galaxy evolution is needed. Based on these two scenarios, for the first time we successfully reproduce the observed {MZRgas} and {MZRstar} simultaneously, together with other independent observational constraints in the local universe. Our model also naturally reproduces the flattening of the {MZRgas} at the high mass end leaving the {MZRstar} intact, as seen in observational data.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the interstellar {NaI} \${\textbackslash}lambda\$5890, 5895 ({NaD}) resonant lines in a complete spectroscopic sample of \${\textbackslash}sim 600,000\$ passive, star-forming and starburst galaxies drawn from {SDSS} {DR}7 in order to look for cold-gas outflows in the local Universe. Individual galaxy spectra are stacked in bins of stellar mass and {SFR} and the dependence of galactic winds, with respect to the galaxies position in the {SFR}-\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$ plane is investigated. While in most cases the interstellar medium ({ISM}) lines are fixed at the galaxy systemic velocity, at the higher {SFR} tail ({SFR}\${\textgreater}12.5 M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$), we find evidence of blue-shifted {NaD} absorption profiles, which we interpret as evidence of neutral outflowing gas. We explore the properties of the {ISM} in these galaxies with high {SFR}, in particular relating the absorption {NaD} line shape with the galaxy geometry in galaxies with different ionization mechanisms: {AGN} and star-formation. We find that: a) the {ISM} {NaD} absorption lines show a clear transition from a strong disk-like component, perfectly centered to the systemic velocity, in the edge-on system (\$i {\textgreater} 50{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ of the disk rotation axis), to an outflow, blue-shifted, component in face-on galaxies (\$i {\textless} 50{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$); b) these trends are observed in galaxies classified as "purely" {SF} and {AGN} dominated objects. We compare the kinematics of the neutral gas with the kinematics of the ionized gas as traced by the [{OIII}]\${\textbackslash}lambda\$5007 emission lines. We find that, in these high {SFR} galaxies, the perturbations of the [{OIII}] emission line are present only in {AGN} or composite systems. In conclusion, we find that, in the local Universe, galactic winds show two faces which are related to two different ejection mechanisms, namely the neutral outflowing gas phase related to the star formation rate along the galaxy disk and the ionized winds related to the {AGN} feedback.},

The low ionization metal lines associated with the {LLS} present two narrow distinct absorption components with a velocity separation of 26 km \$\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. We detect six galaxies within 600 km \$\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ from the absorption redshift; their projected distances from the quasar sightline range from 60 to 200 kpc. The optical spectra of five of these galaxies exhibit prominent nebular emission lines, from which we deduce extinction-corrected star formation rates in the range {SFR} = 0.06-1.3 M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\${\textasciitilde}yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, and metallicities between 0.2 Z\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and Z\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. The sixth galaxy is only detected in the stellar continuum. By combining our data with archival Keck/{HIRES} spectroscopy of the quasar and {HST}/{WFPC}2 imaging of the field, we can relate absorption line and galaxy kinematics; we conclude that the {LLS} is most likely associated with the galaxy closest to the quasar sight-line (galaxy "a"). Our morphokinematic analysis of galaxy "a" combined with the absorption line kinematics supports the interpretation that one of the absorption components originates from an extension of the stellar disk of galaxy "a", while the other component may arise in accreting gas in a warped disk with specific angular momentum \${\textbackslash}sim 3\$ times larger than the specific angular momentum of the galaxy halo. Such warped disks are common features in hydrodynamical simulations of cold-flow accretion onto galaxies; the data presented here provide observational evidence in favour of this scenario.},

We find 6 galaxies in our sample that appear to have an active {AGN} that is preventing on-going star-formation; this is the first time such a feedback mechanism has been observed in this mass range. Interestingly, five of these six galaxies have an ionised gas component that is kinematically offset from their stellar component, suggesting the gas is either recently accreted or outflowing. We hypothesise these six galaxies are low-mass equivalents to the "red geysers" observed in more massive galaxies. Of the other 62 galaxies in the sample, we find 8 do appear for have some low-level, residual star formation, or emission from hot, evolved stars. The remaining galaxies in our sample have no detectable ionised gas emission throughout their structures, consistent with them being quenched.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07355},
	abstract = {We present the analysis of the {XMM}-Newton data of the Circum-Galactic Medium of {MASsive} Spirals ({CGM}-{MASS}) sample of six extremely massive spiral galaxies in the local Universe. All the {CGM}-{MASS} galaxies have diffuse X-ray emission from hot gas detected above the background extending \${\textbackslash}sim(30-100){\textbackslash}rm{\textasciitilde}kpc\$ from the galactic center. This doubles the existing detection of such extended hot {CGM} around massive spiral galaxies. The radial soft X-ray intensity profile of hot gas can be fitted with a \${\textbackslash}beta\$-function with the slope typically in the range of \${\textbackslash}beta=0.35-0.55\$. This range, as well as those \${\textbackslash}beta\$ values measured for other massive spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way ({MW}), are in general consistent with X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies of similar hot gas luminosity and temperature, and with those predicted from a hydrostatic isothermal gaseous halo. Hot gas in such massive spiral galaxy tends to have temperature comparable to its virial value, indicating the importance of gravitational heating. This is in contrast to lower mass galaxies where hot gas temperature tends to be systematically higher than the virial one. The ratio of the radiative cooling to free fall timescales of hot gas is much larger than the critical value of \${\textbackslash}sim10\$ throughout the entire halos of all the {CGM}-{MASS} galaxies, indicating the inefficiency of gas cooling and precipitation in the {CGM}. The hot {CGM} in these massive spiral galaxies is thus most likely in a hydrostatic state, with the feedback material mixed with the {CGM}, instead of escaping out of the halo or falling back to the disk. We also homogenize and compare the halo X-ray luminosity measured for the {CGM}-{MASS} galaxies and other galaxy samples and discuss the "missing" galactic feedback detected in these massive spiral galaxies.},

	abstract = {X-ray emitting gaseous coronae around massive galaxies are a basic prediction of galaxy formation models. Although the coronae around spiral galaxies offer a fundamental test of these models, observational constraints on their characteristics are still scarce. While the presence of extended hot coronae has been established around a handful of massive spiral galaxies, the short X-ray observations only allowed to measure the basic characteristics of the coronae. In this work, we utilize deep {XMM}-Newton observations of {NGC} 6753 to explore its extended X-ray corona in unprecedented detail. Specifically, we establish the isotropic morphology of the hot gas, suggesting that it resides in hydrostatic equilibrium. The temperature profile of the gas shows a decrease with increasing radius: it drops from \${kT}{\textbackslash}approx0.7\$ {keV} in the innermost parts to \${kT}{\textbackslash}approx0.4\$ {keV} at 50 kpc radius. The temperature map reveals the complex temperature structure of the gas. We study the metallicity distribution of the gas, which is uniform at \$Z{\textbackslash}approx0.1\$ Solar. This value is about an order of magnitude lower than that obtained for elliptical galaxies with similar dark matter halo mass, hinting that the hot gas in spiral galaxies predominantly originates from external gas inflows rather than from internal sources. By extrapolating the density profile of the hot gas out to the virial radius, we estimate the total gas mass and derive the total baryon mass of {NGC} 6753. We conclude that the baryon mass fraction is \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\} {\textbackslash}approx 0.06\$, implying that about half of the baryons are missing.},

While some codes are explicitly built around using a Voronoi grid, others, such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}), use particle-based representations and can benefit from constructing a Voronoi grid for post-processing their output. So far, calculating the density of each Voronoi cell from {SPH} data has been done numerically, which is both slow and potentially inaccurate. This paper proposes an alternative analytic method, which is fast and accurate. We derive an expression for the integral of a cubic spline kernel over the volume of a Voronoi cell and link it to the density of the cell. Mass conservation is ensured rigorously by the procedure. The method can be applied more broadly to integrate a spherically symmetric polynomial function over the volume of a random polyhedron.},

	abstract = {Galactic outflows regulate the amount of gas galaxies convert into stars. However, it is difficult to measure the mass outflows remove because they span a large range of temperatures and phases. Here, we study the rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum of a lensed galaxy at z{\textasciitilde}2.9 with prominent interstellar absorption lines from O I, tracing neutral gas, up to O {VI}, tracing transitional phase gas. The O {VI} profile mimics weak low-ionization profiles at low velocities, and strong saturated profiles at high velocities. These trends indicate that O {VI} gas is co-spatial with the low-ionization gas. Further, at velocities blueward of -200 km/s the column density of the low-ionization outflow rapidly drops while the O {VI} column density rises, suggesting that O {VI} is created as the low-ionization gas is destroyed. Photoionization models do not reproduce the observed O {VI}, but adequately match the low-ionization gas, indicating that the phases have different formation mechanisms. Photoionized outflows are more massive than O {VI} outflows for most of the observed velocities, although the O {VI} mass outflow rate exceeds the photoionized outflow at velocities above the galaxy's escape velocity. Therefore, most gas capable of escaping the galaxy is in a hot outflow phase. We suggest that the O {VI} absorption is a temporary by-product of conduction transferring mass from the photoionized phase to an unobserved hot wind, and discuss how this mass-loading impacts the observed circum-galactic medium.},

In such shallow potential wells, outflows may produce massive amounts of enriched halo gas (circum-galactic medium or {CGM}) and pollute the intergalactic medium ({IGM}). Here, we present a survey of the {CGM} and {IGM} around \$18\$ star-forming field dwarfs with stellar masses of \${\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash},M\_*/M\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textbackslash}approx8-9\$ at \$z{\textbackslash}approx0.2\$. Eight of these have {CGM} probed by quasar absorption spectra at projected distances, \$d\$, less than the host virial radius, \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$. Ten are probed in the surrounding {IGM} at \$d/R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}=1-3\$. The absorption measurements include neutral hydrogen, the dominant silicon ions for diffuse cool gas (\$T{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}4\$ K; Si {II}, Si {III}, and Si {IV}), moderately ionized carbon (C {IV}), and highly ionized oxygen (O {VI}). Metal absorption from the {CGM} of the dwarfs is less common and \${\textbackslash}approx4{\textbackslash}times\$ weaker compared to massive star-forming galaxies though O {VI} absorption is still common. None of the dwarfs probed at \$d/R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}=1-3\$ have definitive metal-line detections. Combining the available silicon ions, we estimate that the cool {CGM} of the dwarfs accounts for only \$2-6{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the expected silicon budget from the yields of supernovae associated with past star-formation. The highly ionized O {VI} accounts for \${\textbackslash}approx8{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the oxygen budget. As O {VI} traces an ion with expected equilibrium ion fractions of \${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.2\$, the highly ionized {CGM} may represent a significant metal reservoir even for dwarfs not expected to maintain gravitationally shock heated hot halos.},

	abstract = {We present a blind search for doublet intergalactic metal absorption with a method we dub `agnostic stacking'. Using forward-modelling we combine it with direct detections in the literature to measure the overall metal population. Here we apply this novel approach to the search for {NeVIII} in 26 high-quality {COS} spectra of {QSOs} at z{\textgreater}0.7. We probe an unprecedented low limit of log N{\textgreater}12.3 at 0.47{\textless}z{\textless}1.34 with a total pathlength \$\{{\textbackslash}Delta\}\$z = 7.36. The method selects absorption without requiring knowledge of its source, be it observing noise, artifacts, or any line transition. Stacking this mixed population with {NeVIII} absorption dilutes doublet features in composite spectra in a deterministic manner. We stack potential {NeVIII} absorption in two regimes: absorption too weak to be statistically significant in direct line studies (12.3 {\textless} log N{\textless} 13.7), and strong absorbers (log N{\textgreater} 13.7). We do not detect {NeVIII} in either regime, and place upper limits on the population using agnostic stacking alone. Combining our measurements with direct line detections, the {NeVIII} population is reproduced with a single power law column density distribution of slope {\textbackslash}b\{eta\} = -1.86 and normalisation log f\_\{13.7\} = -13.99, leading to an incidence rate of strong {NeVIII} absorbers of dn/dz =1.38. Comparing our results with a group of 3 systems in {PG}1148+549, these have a 0.024\% probability of arising by chance. We infer a cosmic mass density for {NeVIII} in the column density range 12.3 {\textless} log N {\textless} 15.0 of \$\{{\textbackslash}Omega\}\$({NeVIII}) = 2.2x10{\textasciicircum}\{-8\}.

For 36 {IR}-bright {DOGs} that show [{OIII}]\${\textbackslash}lambda\$5007 emission in the {SDSS} spectra, we performed a detailed spectral analysis to investigate their ionized gas properties. In particular, we measured the velocity offset (the velocity with respect to the systemic velocity measured from the stellar absorption lines) and the velocity dispersion of the [{OIII}] line. We found that the derived velocity offset and dispersion of most {IR}-bright {DOGs} are larger than those of Seyfert 2 galaxies (Sy2s) at \$z {\textless} 0.3\$, meaning that the {IR}-bright {DOGs} show relatively strong outflows compared to Sy2s. This can be explained by the difference of {IR} luminosity contributed from active galactic nucleus, \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {IR}\}\$ ({AGN}), because we found that (i) \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {IR}\}\$ ({AGN}) correlates with the velocity offset and dispersion of [{OIII}] and (ii) our {IR}-bright {DOGs} sample has larger \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {IR}\}\$ ({AGN}) than Sy2s. Nevertheless, the fact that about 75\% {IR}-bright {DOGs} have a large (\${\textgreater}\$ 300 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) velocity dispersion, which is a larger fraction compared to other {AGN} populations, suggests that {IR}-bright {DOGs} are good laboratories to investigate {AGN} feedback. The velocity offset and dispersion of [{OIII}] and [{NeIII}]\${\textbackslash}lambda\$3869 are larger than those of [{OII}]\${\textbackslash}lambda\$3727, which indicates that the highly ionized gas tends to show more stronger outflows.},

Outflowing gas is identified in the far-infrared through P-Cygni line shapes and absorption blueshifted wings in molecular lines with high dipolar moments, and through emission line wings of fine-structure lines of ionized gas. We quantify the detectability of galaxy-scale massive molecular and ionized outflows as a function of redshift in {AGN}-dominated, starburst-dominated, and main-sequence galaxies, explore the detectability of metal-rich inflows in the local Universe, and describe the most significant synergies with other current and future observatories that will measure feedback in galaxies via complementary tracers at other wavelengths.},

We employ a Bayesian method for modelling a combination of absorption lines to derive physical properties of absorbers with a formal treatment of detections, including saturated systems, and non-detections in a uniform manner. We find that in the lines of sight passing through localized density structures, absorption lines of low, intermediate and high ions are present in the spectrum and overlap in velocity space. Low, intermediate and high ions can be combined to derive the mass-weighted properties of a density-varying peak, although the ions are not co-spatial within the structure. By contrast, lines of sight that go through the hot halo only exhibit detectable {HI} and high ions. In such lines of sight, the absorption lines are typically broad due to the complex velocity fields across the entire halo. We show that the derived gas density, temperature, and metallicity match closely the corresponding {HI} mass-weighted averages along the {LOS}. We also show that when the data quality allows, our Bayesian technique allows one to recover the underlying physical properties of {LOS} by incorporating both detections and non-detections. It is especially useful to include non-detections, of species such as {NV} or {NeVIII}, when the number of detections of strong absorbers, such as {HI} and {OVI}, is smaller than the number of model parameters (density, temperature, and metallicity).},

The four strong {CIV} absorbers reside at \$z=5.74\$, \$5.52\$, \$4.95\$, and \$4.87\$, with column densities ranging from \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{CIV}\}\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{13.8\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{14.8\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$. At \$z=5.74\$, we detect an i-dropout Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emitter ({LAE}) candidate with a projected impact parameter of 42 physical kpc from the {CIV} absorber. This {LAE} candidate has a Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$-based star formation rate ({SFR}\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{Ly{\textbackslash}alpha\}\}\$) of 2 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and a {UV}-based {SFR} of 4 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Although we cannot completely rule out that this \$i\$-dropout emitter may be an [{OII}] interloper, its measured properties are consistent with the {CIV} powering galaxy at \$z=5.74\$. For {CIV} absorbers at \$z=4.95\$ and \$z=4.87\$, although we detect two {LAE} candidates with impact parameters of 160 kpc and 200 kpc, such distances are larger than that predicted from the simulations. Therefore we treat them as non-detections. For the system at \$z=5.52\$, we do not detect {LAE} candidates, placing a 3-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ upper limit of {SFR}\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{Ly{\textbackslash}alpha\}\}{\textbackslash}approx 1.5{\textbackslash} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. In summary, in these four cases, we only detect one plausible {CIV} source at \$z=5.74\$. Combining the modest {SFR} of the one detection and the three non-detections, our {HST} observations strongly support that smaller galaxies ({SFR}\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{Ly{\textbackslash}alpha\}\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 2{\textbackslash} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) are main sources of intergalactic {CIV} absorbers, and such small galaxies play a major role in the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium at \$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim5\$.},

	abstract = {The processes taking place in the outermost reaches of spiral disks (the 'proto-disk') are intimately connected to the build-up of mass and angular momentum in galaxies. The thinness of spiral disks suggests that the activity is mostly quiescent and presumably this region is fed by cool flows coming into the halo from the intergalactic medium. While there is abundant evidence for the presence of a circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) around disk galaxies as traced by quasar absorption lines, it has been very difficult to connect this material to the outer gas disk. This has been a very difficult transition region to explore because baryon tracers are hard to observe. In particular, {HI} disks have been argued to truncate at a critical column density N(H) \${\textbackslash}approx 3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{19\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ at 30 kpc for an L* galaxy where the gas is vulnerable to the external ionizing background. But new deep observations of nearby L* spirals (e.g. Milky Way, {NGC} 2997) suggest that {HI} disks may extend much further than recognised to date, up to 60 kpc at N(H) \${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{18\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$. Motivated by these observations, here we show that a clumpy outer disk of dense clouds or cloudlets is potentially detectable to much larger radii and lower {HI} column densities than previously discussed. This extended proto-disk component is likely to explain some of the {MgII} forest seen in quasar spectra as judged from absorption-line column densities and kinematics. We fully anticipate that the armada of new radio facilities and planned {HI} surveys coming online will detect this extreme outer disk (scree) material. We also propose a variant on the successful 'Dragonfly' technique to go after the very weak H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ signals expected in the proto-disk region.},

	abstract = {We examine the linear stability of an isothermal filamentary cloud permeated by a perpendicular magnetic field. Our model cloud is assumed to be supported by gas pressure against the self-gravity in the unperturbed state. For simplicity, the density distribution is assumed to be symmetric around the axis. Also for simplicity, the initial magnetic field is assumed to be uniform and turbulence is not taken into account. The perturbation equation is formulated to be an eigenvalue problem. The growth rate is obtained as a function of the wavenumber for fragmentation along the axis and the magnetic field strength. The growth rate depends critically on the outer boundary. If the displacement vanishes in the region very far from the cloud axis (fixed boundary), cloud fragmentation is suppressed by a moderate magnetic field, which means the plasma beta is below 1.67 on the cloud axis. If the displacement is constant along the magnetic field in the region very far from the cloud, the cloud is unstable even when the magnetic field is infinitely strong. The cloud is deformed by circulation in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. The unstable mode is not likely to induce dynamical collapse, since it is excited even when the whole cloud is magnetically subcritical. For both the boundary conditions the magnetic field increases the wavelength of the most unstable mode. We find that the magnetic force suppresses compression perpendicular to the magnetic field especially in the region of low density.},

	abstract = {Galaxy formation depends critically on the physical state of gas in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) and its interface with the intergalactic medium ({IGM}), determined by the complex interplay between inflows from the {IGM} and outflows from supernovae or {AGN} feedback. The average Lyman-alpha (Ly-a) absorption profile around galactic halos represents a powerful tool to probe their gaseous environments. We compare predictions from Illustris and Nyx hydrodynamical simulations with the observed absorption around foreground quasars, damped Ly-a systems, and Lyman-break galaxies. We show how large-scale {BOSS} and small-scale quasar pair measurements can be combined to precisely constrain the absorption profile over three decades in transverse distance 20kpc\${\textbackslash}lesssim b{\textbackslash}lesssim\$20Mpc. Far from galaxies \${\textbackslash}gtrsim2\$Mpc, the simulations converge to the same profile and provide a reasonable match to the observations. This asymptotic agreement arises because the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} model successfully describes the ambient {IGM}, and represents a critical advantage of studying the mean absorption profile. However, significant differences between the simulations, and between simulations and observations are present on scales 20kpc\${\textbackslash}lesssim b{\textbackslash}lesssim\$2Mpc, illustrating the challenges of accurately modeling and resolving galaxy formation physics. It is noteworthy that these differences are observed as far out as \${\textbackslash}sim2\$Mpc, indicating that the `sphere-of-influence' of galaxies could extend to approximately \${\textbackslash}sim20\$ times the halo virial radius (\${\textbackslash}sim100\$kpc). Current observations are very precise on these scales and can thus strongly discriminate between different galaxy formation models. We demonstrate that the Ly-a absorption profile is primarily sensitive to the underlying temperature-density relationship of diffuse gas around galaxies, and argue that it thus provides a fundamental test of galaxy formation models.},

	abstract = {We use a suite of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations from the Evolution and Assembly of {GaLaxies} and their Environments ({EAGLE}) project to investigate the formation of hot hydrostatic haloes and their dependence on feedback mechanisms. We find that the appearance of a strong bimodality in the probability density function ({PDF}) of the ratio of the radiative cooling and dynamical times for halo gas provides a clear signature of the formation of a hot corona. Haloes of total mass \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\{{\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ develop a hot corona independent of redshift, at least in the interval \$z=0-4\$ where the simulation has sufficiently good statistics. We analyse the build up of the hot gas mass in the halo, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{hot\}\}\$, as a function of halo mass and redshift and find that while more energetic galactic winds powered by {SNe} increases \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{hot\}\}\$, {AGN} feedback reduces it by ejecting gas from the halo. We also study the thermal properties of gas accreting onto haloes and measure the fraction of shock-heated gas as a function of redshift and halo mass. We develop analytic and semianalytic approaches to estimate a `critical halo mass', \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{crit\}\}\$, for hot halo formation. We find that the mass for which the heating rate produced by accretion shocks equals the radiative cooling rate, reproduces the mass above which haloes develop a significant hot atmosphere. This yields a mass estimate of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{crit\}\} {\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.7\}\{{\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at \$z=0\$, which agrees with the simulation results.

This turnover supports the hypothesis that the oxygen originates in the central galaxies. When converted into oxygen space density using an Abel integral inversion, the {OVI} columns require greater than \${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ of oxygen concentrated near 100 kpc.

The feedback power necessary to maintain such oxygen-rich atmospheres for many Gyrs cannot be easily supplied by galactic supernovae.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03646},
	abstract = {Dark matter subhalos are the remnants of (incomplete) halo mergers. Identifying them and establishing their evolutionary links in the form of merger trees is one of the most important applications of cosmological simulations. The Hierachical Bound-Tracing ({HBT}) code identifies halos as they form and tracks their evolution as they merge, simultaneously detecting subhalos and building their merger trees. Here we present a new implementation of this approach, {HBT}+, that is much faster, more user friendly, and more physically complete than the original code. Applying {HBT}+ to cosmological simulations we show that both the subhalo mass function and the peak-mass function are well fit by similar double-Schechter functions.The ratio between the two is highest at the high mass end, reflecting the resilience of massive subhalos that experience substantial dynamical friction but limited tidal stripping. The radial distribution of the most massive subhalos is more concentrated than the universal radial distribution of lower mass subhalos. Subhalo finders that work in configuration space tend to underestimate the masses of massive subhalos, an effect that is stronger in the host centre. This may explain, at least in part, the excess of massive subhalos in galaxy cluster centres inferred from recent lensing observations. We demonstrate that the peak-mass function is a powerful diagnostic of merger tree defects, and the merger trees constructed using {HBT}+ do not suffer from the missing or switched links that tend to afflict merger trees constructed from more conventional halo finders. We make the {HBT}+ code publicly available.},

	abstract = {Metals are ideal tracers of the baryonic cycle within halos. Their composition is a fossil record connecting the evolution of the various stellar components of galaxies to the interaction with the environment by in- and outflows. The Magneticum simulations allow to study halos across a large range of masses and environments, from massive galaxy clusters containing hundreds of galaxies down to isolated field galaxies. They include a detailed treatment of the chemo-energetic feedback from the stellar component and its evolution as well as feedback from the evolution of supermassive black holes. Following the detailed evolution of various metal species and their relative composition due to continuing enrichment of the {IGM} and {ICM} by {SNIa}, {SNII} and {AGB} winds of the evolving stellar population reveals the complex interplay of local star formation processes, mixing, global baryonic flows, secular galactic evolution and environmental processes. We present results from the Magneticum simulations on the chemical properties of simulated galaxies and galaxy clusters, carefully comparing them to observations. We show that the simulations already reach a very high level of realism within their complex descriptions of the chemo-energetic feedback, successfully reproducing a large number of observed properties and scaling relations. Our simulated galaxies clearly indicate that there are no strong secondary parameters (like star formation rates at fixed redshift) driving the scatter in these scaling relations. The remaining differences clearly point to detailed physical processes which have to be included into future simulations.},

With the aid of a spectroscopic simulation code, we infer the median gas density of the cloud to be roughly 0.3 \${\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, with which the elemental abundance in various ionization stages, in particular C I, is consistently explained. This gas density implies that the size of the Mg {II} clouds is of the order of 0.03 kpc, which suggests that individual Mg {II} clouds around a galaxy are of a baryonic mass typically \${\textbackslash}rm 10{\textasciicircum}\{3\} {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$.

	abstract = {Star formation rate density ({SFRD}) has not been constant throughout the history of the Universe. The rate at which stars form greatly affects the evolution of the Universe, but the factors which drive {SFRD} evolution remain uncertain. There must be sufficient amount of gas to fuel the star formation, either as a reservoir within a galaxy, or as inflow from the intergalactic medium ({IGM}). This work explores how the gas accretion rate onto galaxies over time has affected star formation rate. We propose a novel method of measuring cosmic gas accretion rate. This involves comparing the comoving densities of available Hi and H2 gas and the densities of existing stars at different redshifts. We constrained gas accretion until z = 5, and we found that the gas accretion rate density ({GARD}) is relatively constant in the range from z = 5 to z = 0. This constancy in the {GARD} is not reflected by the {SFRD}, which declines significantly between z = 1.0 and z = 0. This work suggests that the decline is not due to a reduction in {GARD}.},

We present the {FIRE}-2 algorithm for coupling mechanical feedback, which can be applied to any hydrodynamics method (e.g. fixed-grid, moving-mesh, and mesh-less methods), and black hole as well as stellar feedback. This algorithm ensures manifest conservation of mass, energy, and momentum, and avoids imprinting 'preferred directions' on the ejecta. We show that it is critical to incorporate both momentum and thermal energy of mechanical ejecta in a self-consistent manner, accounting for {SNe} cooling radii when they are not resolved. Using idealized simulations of single {SNe} explosions, we show that the {FIRE}-2 algorithm, independent of resolution, reproduces converged solutions in both energy and momentum. In contrast, common 'fully-thermal' (energy-dump) or 'fully-kinetic' (particle-kicking) schemes in the literature depend strongly on resolution: when applied at mass resolution \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 100{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, they diverge by orders-of-magnitude from the converged solution. In galaxy-formation simulations, this divergence leads to orders-of-magnitude differences in galaxy properties, unless those models are adjusted in a resolution-dependent way. We show that all models that individually time-resolve {SNe} converge to the {FIRE}-2 solution at sufficiently high resolution (\${\textless}100{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$). However, in both idealized single-{SNe} simulations and cosmological galaxy-formation simulations, the {FIRE}-2 algorithm converges much faster than other sub-grid models without re-tuning parameters.},

The sightlines extend out to roughly the virial radius of the galaxy halo. We construct control samples of normal star-forming low-redshift galaxies from the {COS}/{HST} archive that match the starbursts in terms of galaxy stellar mass and impact parameter. We find clear evidence that the {CGM} around the starbursts differs systematically compared to the control galaxies. The Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$, Si {III}, C {IV}, and possibly O {VI} absorption-lines are stronger as a function of impact parameter, and the ratios of the equivalent widths of C {IV}/Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and Si {III}/Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ are both larger than in normal star-forming galaxies. We also find that the widths and the velocity offsets (relative to \$v\_\{sys\}\$) of the Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ absorption-lines are significantly larger in the {CGM} of the starbursts, implying velocities of the absorbing material that are roughly twice the halo virial velocity. We show that these properties can be understood as a consequence of the interaction between a starburst-driven wind and the pre-existing {CGM}. These results underscore the importance of winds driven from intensely star-forming galaxies in helping drive the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium. They also offer a new probe of the properties of starburst-driven winds and of the {CGM} itself.},

This relatively new branch of astrophysics has become possible due to the development of reliable numerical algorithms and the high performance of modern computing technologies. These enable the analysis of large collections of observational data and the acquisition of new data via simulations at unprecedented accuracy and resolution. Ideally, simulations run until they reach some pre-determined termination condition, but often other factors cause extensive numerical approaches to break down at an earlier stage. In those cases, processes tend to be interrupted due to unexpected events in the software or the hardware. In those cases, the scientist handles the interrupt manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. We present the Simulation Monitor ({SiMon}) to automatize the farming of large and extensive simulation processes. Our method is light-weight, it fully automates the entire workflow management, operates concurrently across multiple platforms and can be installed in user space. Inspired by the process of crop farming, we perceive each simulation as a crop in the field and running simulation becomes analogous to growing crops. With the development of {SiMon} we relax the technical aspects of simulation management. The initial package was developed for extensive parameter searchers in numerical simulations, but it turns out to work equally well for automating the computational processing and reduction of observational data reduction.},

We develop a quantitative and probabilistic analysis based on the apparent optical depth method of the properties of the absorbers as a function of impact parameter from their nearby galaxies: in such a way we probe different environments from circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) to low density filaments. Absorbers' properties are then compared with a spectroscopic observational data set obtained from high resolution quasar spectra. Our main focus is on the N\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CIV}\}\$ - N\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {HI}\}\$ relation around simulated galaxies: the results obtained with {MUPPI} and the Effective model are remarkably similar, with small differences only confined to regions at impact parameters \$b = [1-3] {\textbackslash}times r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$. Using \${\textbackslash}rm C\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {IV}\}\$ as a tracer of the metallicity, we obtain evidence that the observed metal absorption systems have the highest probability to be confined in a region of 150-400 kpc around galaxies. Near-filament environments have instead metallicities too low to be probed by present-day telescopes, but could be probed by future spectroscopical studies.

Outcomes of this work are two-fold: (i) a clarification of the formulation of genetic modifications and (ii) a proof of concept for quadratic modifications leading the way to a forthcoming implementation in cosmological simulations.},

	abstract = {We use three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of vertically stratified patches of galactic discs to study how the spatio-temporal clustering of supernovae ({SNe}) enhances the power of galactic winds. {SNe} that are randomly distributed throughout a galactic disc drive inefficient galactic winds because most supernova remnants lose their energy radiatively before breaking out of the disc. Accounting for the fact that most star formation is clustered alleviates this problem. Super-bubbles driven by the combined effects of clustered {SNe} propagate rapidly enough to break out of galactic discs well before the clusters' {SNe} stop going off. The radiative losses post-breakout are reduced dramatically and a large fraction (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.2\$) of the energy released by {SNe} vents into the halo powering a strong galactic wind. These energetic winds are capable of providing strong preventative feedback and eject substantial mass from the galaxy with outflow rates on the order of the star formation rate. The momentum flux in the wind is only of order that injected by the {SNe}, because the hot gas vents before doing significant work on the surroundings. We show that our conclusions hold for a range of galaxy properties, both in the local Universe (e.g., M82) and at high redshift (e.g., \$z {\textbackslash}sim 2\$ star forming galaxies). We further show that if the efficiency of forming star clusters increases with increasing gas surface density, as suggested by theoretical arguments, the condition for star cluster-driven super-bubbles to break out of galactic discs corresponds to a threshold star formation rate surface density for the onset of galactic winds \${\textbackslash}sim 0.03\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, of order that observed.},

Such studies have revealed a multiphase medium with a number of poorly-understood features leading to a need to study the ionization mechanism of this gas. To better interpret these observations, we make use of a suite of adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulations of cold, atomic clouds driven by hot, supersonic outflows, including the effect of radiative cooling, thermal conduction, and an ionizing background characteristic of a starbursting galaxy. Using a new analysis tool, Trident, we estimate the equilibrium column density distributions for ten different ions: H I, Mg {II}, C {II}, C {III}, C {IV}, Si {III}, Si {IV}, N V, O {VI}, and Ne {VIII}. These are fit to model profiles with two parameters describing the maximum column density and coverage, and for each ion we provide a table of these fit parameters, along with average velocities and line widths. Our results are most sensitive to Mach number and conduction efficiency, with higher Mach numbers and more efficient conduction leading to more compact, high column density clouds. We use our results to interpret down-the-barrel observations of outflows and find that the adopted ionization equilibrium model overpredicts column densities of ions such as Si {IV} and does not adequately capture the observed trends for N V and O {VI}, implying the presence of strong non equilibrium ionization effects.},

The forbidden lines show strong broadening, up to 2270 km/s. An ionization stratification (higher line shift at higher ionization potential) implies that we see a large-scale outflow rather than single, localized jet-cloud interactions. Similarly, the paucity of zero-velocity [{OIII}]\${\textbackslash}lambda\$5007 emitting gas implies the absence of a second narrow-line region ({NLR}) component at rest, and therefore a large part of the high-ionization {NLR} is affected by the outflow. Given the radio loudness of these {NLS}1 galaxies, the observations are consistent with a pole on view onto their central engines, so that the effects of polar outflows are maximized. In addition, a very efficient driving mechanism is required, to reach the high observed velocities. We explore implications from recent hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction between fast winds or jets with the large-scale {NLR}. Overall, the best agreement with observations (and especially the high outflow speeds of the [{NeV}] emitting gas) can be reached if the {NLS}1 galaxies are relatively young sources with lifetimes not much exceeding 1 Myr.

	abstract = {We present a new, open source, free semi-analytic model ({SAM}) of galaxy formation, Shark, designed to be highly flexible and modular, allowing easy exploration of different physical processes and ways of modelling them. We introduce the philosophy behind Shark and provide an overview of the physical processes included in the model. Shark is written in C++11 and has been parallelized with {OpenMP}. In the released version (v1.1), we implement several different models for gas cooling, active galactic nuclei, stellar and photo-ionisation feedback, and star formation ({SF}). We demonstrate the basic performance of Shark using the Planck15 cosmology {SURFS} simulations, by comparing against a large set of observations, including: the stellar mass function ({SMF}) and stellar-halo mass relation at z=0-4; the cosmic evolution of the star formation rate density ({SFRD}), stellar mass, atomic and molecular hydrogen; local gas scaling relations; and structural galaxy properties, finding excellent agreement. Significant improvements over previous {SAMs} are seen in the mass-size relation for disks/bulges, the gas-stellar mass and stellar mass-metallicity relations. To illustrate the power of Shark in exploring the systematic effects of the galaxy formation modelling, we quantify how the scatter of the {SF} main sequence and the gas scaling relations changes with the adopted {SF} law, and the effect of the starbursts H\$\_2\$ depletion timescale on the {SFRD} and \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm H\_2\}\$. We compare Shark with other {SAMs} and the hydrodynamical simulation {EAGLE}, and find that {SAMs} have a much higher halo baryon fractions due to large amounts of intra-halo gas, which in the case of {EAGLE} is in the intergalactic medium.},

	abstract = {Recent spatially-resolved observations of massive early-type galaxies ({ETGs}) have uncovered evidence for radial gradients of the stellar initial mass function ({IMF}), ranging from super-Salpeter {IMFs} in the centre to Milky Way-like beyond the half-light radius, \$r\_e\$. We compare these findings with our new cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations based on the {EAGLE} model that self-consistently vary the {IMF} on a per-particle basis such that it becomes either bottom-heavy ({LoM}-50) or top-heavy ({HiM}-50) in high-pressure environments. These simulations were calibrated to reproduce inferred {IMF} variations such that the {IMF} becomes "heavier" due to either excess dwarf stars or stellar remnants, respectively, in galaxies with increasing stellar velocity dispersion. In agreement with observations, both simulations produce negative radial {IMF} gradients, transitioning from high to low excess mass-to-light ratio ({MLE}) at around \$r\_e\$. We find negative metallicity radial gradients for both simulations, but positive and flat [Mg/Fe] gradients in {LoM}-50 and {HiM}-50, respectively. Measured in radial bins, the {MLE} increases strongly with local metallicity for both simulations, in agreement with observations. However, the local {MLE} increases and decreases with local [Mg/Fe] in {LoM}-50 and {HiM}-50, respectively. These qualitative differences can be used to break degeneracies in the manner with which the {IMF} varies in these high-mass {ETGs}. At \$z=2\$, we find that the {MLE} has a higher and lower normalization for bottom- and top-heavy {IMF} variations, respectively. We speculate that a hybrid of our {LoM} and {HiM} models may be able to reconcile observed {IMF} diagnostics in star-forming galaxies and {ETGs}.},

The absence of evidence for a strong shock coinciding with the edge of the bubbles, and constraints from multi-wavelength observations point towards stochastic acceleration by turbulence as a likely mechanism of acceleration. We have investigated the time-dependent acceleration of electrons in a large-scale outflow from the Galactic centre. For the first time, we present a detailed numerical solution of the particle kinetic equation that includes the acceleration, transport and relevant energy loss processes. We also take into account the addition of shock acceleration of electrons at the bubble's blast wave. Fitting to the observed spectrum and surface brightness distribution of the bubbles allows determining the transport coefficients, thereby shedding light on the origin of the Fermi bubbles.},

High resolution (\$0.24"\$) [{CI}](1-0) line images surprisingly reveal that the outflow emission peaks between the two {AGNs}, rather than on either of the two, and that it dominates the velocity field in this nuclear region. We combine the [{CI}](1-0) and {CO}(1-0) data to constrain the {CO}-to-H\$\_2\$ conversion factor (\${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CO}\}\$) in the outflow, which is on average \$2.1{\textbackslash}pm1.2{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} (K{\textasciitilde}km{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textasciitilde}pc{\textasciicircum}2){\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$.

We propose that molecular outflows are the location of the warmer, strongly unbound phase that partially reduces the opacity of the {CO} lines in (U){LIRGs}, hence driving down their global \${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CO}\}\$ and increasing their \$r\_\{21\}\$ values.},

Our results show a significant evolution of the structural quantities at intermediate redshift for the massive spheroids (\${\textbackslash}mbox\{Log\}{\textbackslash} M\_*/M\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textgreater}11\$, Chabrier {IMF}), while almost no evolution has found for less massive ones (\${\textbackslash}mbox\{Log\}{\textbackslash} M\_*/M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textless} 11\$). On the other hand, disc dominated systems show a milder evolution in the less massive systems (\${\textbackslash}mbox\{Log\}{\textbackslash} M\_*/M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textless} 11\$) and possibly no evolution of the more massive systems. These trends are generally consistent with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations and independent datasets out to redshift z {\textasciitilde} 0.6, although in some cases the scatter of the data is large to drive final conclusions. These results, based on 1/10 of the expected {KiDS} area, reinforce precedent finding based on smaller statistical samples and show the route toward more accurate results, expected with the the next survey releases.},

Lacking are dynamical models of observed dwarf galaxy pairs to disentangle the physical processes regulating their baryon cycles. We present new optical data and the first detailed theoretical model of an observed tidal encounter between two isolated low mass galaxies, {NGC} 4490 \& {NGC} 4485. This system is an isolated analog of the Magellanic Clouds and is surrounded by a {\textasciitilde}50 kpc extended {HI} envelope. We use hybrid \$N\$-body and test-particle simulations along with a visualization interface \$Identikit\$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed present-day morphology and kinematics. Our results demonstrate how repeated encounters between two dwarf galaxies can "park" baryons at very large distances, without the aid of environmental effects. Our best match to the data is an 8:1 mass ratio encounter where a one-armed spiral is induced in the {NGC} 4490-analog, which we postulate explains the nature of diffuse starlight presented in the new optical data. We predict that the pair will fully merge in {\textasciitilde}370 Myr, but that the extended tidal features will continue to evolve and return to the merged remnant over {\textasciitilde}5 Gyr. This pre-processing of baryons will affect the efficiency of gas stripping if such dwarf pairs are accreted by a massive host.

We suggest that the nearby Lupus complex and parts of the Ophiuchus complex constitute the denser parts of the structure. This young bubble, {\textless} 3 Myr old, could be the remnant of a supernova and expands inside a larger {HI} loop that has been created by the outflows of the Upper Scorpius {OB} association. An {HI} cavity filled with hot X-ray gas is associated with the structure, which is consistent with the Galactic chimney scenario. The X-ray emission extends beyond the west and north-west edges of the bubble, suggesting that hot gas outflows are breaching the cavity, possibly through the fragmented Lupus complex. Analyses of the polarised radio synchrotron and of the polarised dust emission of the region suggest the connection of the Galactic centre spur with the young Galactic bubble. A distribution of {HI} clumps that spatially corresponds well to the cavity boundaries was found at V\_LSR {\textasciitilde} -100 km/s. Some of these {HI} clumps are forming jets, which may arise from the fragmented part of the bubble. We suggest that these clumps might be `dripping' cold clouds from the shell walls inside the cavity that is filled with hot ionised gas. It is possible that some of these clumps are magnetised and were then accelerated by the compressed magnetic field at the edge of the cavity. Such a mechanism would challenge the Galactic accretion and fountain model, where high-velocity clouds are considered to be formed at high Galactic latitude from hot gas flows from the Galactic plane.},

One criterion that can be measured is the publication record of an applicant. The publication records of past fellowship recipients may, therefore, provide some quantitative guidance for future prospective applicants. We investigated the publication patterns of recipients of the {NASA} prize postdoctoral fellowships in the Hubble, Einstein, and Sagan programs from 2014 through 2017, using the {NASA} {ADS} reference system. We tabulated their publications at the point where fellowship applications were submitted, and we find that the 133 fellowship recipients in that time frame had a median of 6 +/- 2 first-author publications, and 14 +/- 6 co-authored publications. The full range of first author papers is 1 to 15, and for all papers ranges from 2 to 76, indicating very diverse publication patterns. Thus, while fellowship recipients generally have strong publication records, the distribution of both first-author and co-authored papers is quite broad; there is no apparent threshold of publications necessary to obtain these fellowships. We also examined the post-{PhD} publication rates for each of the three fellowship programs, between male and female recipients, across the four years of the analysis and find no consistent trends. We hope that these findings will prove a useful reference to future junior scientists.},

	abstract = {The spread of ideas in the scientific community is often viewed as a competition, in which good ideas spread further because of greater intrinsic fitness. As a result, it is commonly believed that publication venue and citation counts correlate with importance and impact. However, relatively little is known about how structural factors influence the spread of ideas, and specifically how where an idea originates can influence how it spreads. Here, we investigate the role of faculty hiring networks, which embody the set of researcher transitions from doctoral to faculty institutions, in shaping the spread of ideas in computer science, and the importance of where in the network an idea originates. We consider comprehensive data on the hiring events of 5,032 faculty at all 205 Ph.D.-granting departments of computer science in the U.S. and Canada, and on the timing and titles of 200,476 associated publications. Analyzing three popular research topics, we show empirically that faculty hiring plays a significant role in driving the spread of ideas across the community. We then use epidemic models to simulate the generic spread of research ideas and quantify the consequences of where an idea originates on its longterm diffusion across the network. We find that research from prestigious institutions spreads more quickly and completely than work of similar quality originating from less prestigious institutions. Our analyses establish the theoretical trade-offs between university prestige and the quality of ideas necessary for efficient circulation. These results suggest a lower bound for epistemic inequality, identify a mechanism for the persistent epistemic advantage observed for elite institutions, and highlight limitations for meritocratic ideals.},

	abstract = {Among the most important goals in cosmology is detecting and quantifying small (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}{\textbackslash}simeq10{\textasciicircum}\{6-9\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) dark matter ({DM}) subhalos. Current probes around the Milky Way ({MW}) are most sensitive to such substructure within \${\textbackslash}sim20\$ kpc of the halo center, where the galaxy contributes significantly to the potential. We explore the effects of baryons on subhalo populations in \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} using cosmological zoom-in baryonic simulations of {MW}-mass halos from the Latte simulation suite, part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments ({FIRE}) project. Specifically, we compare simulations of the same two halos run using (1) {DM}-only ({DMO}), (2) full baryonic physics, and (3) {DM} with an embedded disk potential grown to match the {FIRE} simulation. Relative to baryonic simulations, {DMO} simulations contain \${\textbackslash}sim2{\textbackslash}times\$ as many subhalos within 100 kpc of the halo center; this excess is \${\textbackslash}gtrsim5{\textbackslash}times\$ within 25 kpc. At \$z=0\$, the baryonic simulations are completely devoid of subhalos down to \$3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}6{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ within \$15\$ kpc of the {MW}-mass galaxy, and fewer than 20 surviving subhalos have orbital pericenters {\textless}20 kpc. Despite the complexities of baryonic physics, the simple addition of an embedded central disk potential to {DMO} simulations reproduces this subhalo depletion, including trends with radius, remarkably well. Thus, the additional tidal field from the central galaxy is the primary cause of subhalo depletion. Subhalos on radial orbits that pass close to the central galaxy are preferentially destroyed, causing the surviving subhalo population to have tangentially biased orbits compared to {DMO} predictions. Our method of embedding a disk potential in {DMO} simulations provides a fast and accurate alternative to full baryonic simulations, thus enabling suites of cosmological simulations that can provide accurate and statistical predictions of substructure populations.},

Assuming models with log-normal scatter about a median relation of the form \$M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}propto M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{halo\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha\$, the preferred log-slope steepens from \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}simeq 1.8\$ in the limit of zero scatter to \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}simeq 2.6\$ in the case of \$2\$ dex of scatter in \$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$ at fixed halo mass. We provide fitting functions for the best-fit relations as a function of scatter, including cases where the relation becomes increasingly stochastic with decreasing mass. We show that if the scatter at fixed halo mass is large enough (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 1\$ dex) and if the median relation is steep enough (\${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}gtrsim 2\$), then the "too-big-to-fail" problem seen in the Local Group can be self-consistently eliminated in about \${\textbackslash}sim 5-10{\textbackslash}\%\$ of realizations. This scenario requires that the most massive subhalos host unobservable ultra-faint dwarfs fairly often; we discuss potentially observable signatures of these systems. Finally, we compare our derived constraints to recent high-resolution simulations of dwarf galaxy formation in the literature. Though simulation-to-simulation scatter in \$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$ at fixed \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{halo\}\$ is large among separate authors (\${\textbackslash}sim 2\$ dex), individual codes produce relations with much less scatter and usually give relations that would over-produce local galaxy counts.},

Overall, we find no evidence for the classical missing satellites or too-big-to-fail ({TBTF}) problems for satellite galaxies in our sample. Among the satellites, {TBTF} is resolved primarily by subhalo disruption and overall mass loss; central density profiles of subhalos are of secondary importance. For non-satellite galaxies, our {LG}-like simulations predict as many as \${\textbackslash}sim10\$ as-of-yet unseen galaxies at distances \$0.3-1\$ Mpc from both hosts, with \$M\_{\textbackslash}ast{\textbackslash}simeq10{\textasciicircum}\{5-6\}{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ (in halos with \$V\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{max\}{\textbackslash}sim 20{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textbackslash},s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$), albeit with large halo-to-halo variance.

	abstract = {We present new nucleosynthesis yields as functions of the stellar mass, metallicity, and explosion energy (corresponding to normal supernovae and hypernovae). We apply the results to the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood. Our new yields are based on the new developments in the observational/theoretical studies of supernovae ({SNe}) and extremely metal-poor ({EMP}) stars in the halo, which have provided excellent opportunities to test the explosion models and their nucleosynthesis. We use the light curve and spectra fitting of individual {SN} to estimate the mass of the progenitor, explosion energy, and produced56Ni mass. Comparison with the abundance patterns of {EMP} stars has made it possible to determine the model parameters of core-collapse {SNe}, such as mixing-fallback parameters. More specifically, we take into account the two distinct new classes of massive {SNe}: (1) very energetic hypernovae, whose kinetic energy ({KE}) is more than 10 times the {KE} of normal core-collapse {SNe}, and (2) very faint and low energy {SNe} (faint {SNe}). These two new classes of {SNe} are likely to be "black-hole-forming" {SNe} with rotating or non-rotating black holes. Nucleosynthesis in hypernovae is characterized by larger abundance ratios (Zn, Co, V, Ti) / Fe and smaller (Mn, Cr) / Fe than normal {SNe}, which can explain the observed trends of these ratios in {EMP} stars. Nucleosynthesis in faint {SNe} is characterized by a large amount of fall-back, which explains the abundance pattern of the most Fe-poor stars. These comparisons suggest that black-hole-forming {SNe} made important contributions to the early galactic (and cosmic) chemical evolution. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Part of this effect can be attributed to an improvement of atomic data and the inclusion of {NLTE} computations, but also the use of hydrodynamical model atmospheres seemed to play a role. This "decrease" with time of the metallicity of the solar photosphere increased the disagreement with the results from helioseismology. With a {CO}5BOLD 3D model of the solar atmosphere, the {CIFIST} team at the Paris Observatory re-determined the photospheric solar abundances of several elements, among them C, N, and O. The spectroscopic abundances are obtained by fitting the equivalent width and/or the profile of observed spectral lines with synthetic spectra computed from the 3D model atmosphere. We conclude that the effects of granular fluctuations depend on the characteristics of the individual lines, but are found to be relevant only in a few particular cases. 3D effects are not reponsible for the systematic lowering of the solar abundances in recent years.

	abstract = {Passive-scalar mixing (metals, molecules, etc.) in the turbulent interstellar medium ({ISM}) is critical for abundance patterns of stars and clusters, galaxy and star formation, and cooling from the circumgalactic medium. However, the fundamental scaling laws remain poorly understood in the highly supersonic, magnetized, shearing regime relevant for the {ISM}. We therefore study the full scaling laws governing passive-scalar transport in idealized simulations of supersonic turbulence. Using simple phenomenological arguments for the variation of diffusivity with scale based on Richardson diffusion, we propose a simple fractional diffusion equation to describe the turbulent advection of an initial passive scalar distribution. These predictions agree well with the measurements from simulations, and vary with turbulent Mach number in the expected manner, remaining valid even in the presence of a large-scale shear flow (e.g. rotation in a galactic disc). The evolution of the scalar distribution is not the same as obtained using simple, constant 'effective diffusivity' as in Smagorinsky models, because the scale dependence of turbulent transport means an initially Gaussian distribution quickly develops highly non-Gaussian tails. We also emphasize that these are mean scalings that apply only to ensemble behaviours (assuming many different, random scalar injection sites): individual Lagrangian 'patches' remain coherent (poorly mixed) and simply advect for a large number of turbulent flow-crossing times.},

	abstract = {We analyze the metal accumulation in dwarf and spiral galaxies by following the history of metal enrichment and outflows in a suite of twenty high-resolution simulated galaxies. These simulations agree with the observed stellar and gas-phase mass-metallicity relation, an agreement that relies on large fractions of the produced metals escaping into the {CGM}. For instance, in galaxies with Mvir {\textasciitilde} 1e9.5 -- 1e10 solar masses, we find that about {\textasciitilde} 85\% of the available metals are outside of the galactic disk at z = 0, although the fraction decreases to a little less than half in Milky Way-mass galaxies. In many cases, these metals are spread far beyond the virial radius. We analyze the metal deficit within the {ISM} and stars in the context of previous work tracking the inflow and outflow of baryons. Outflows are prevalent across the entire mass range, as is reaccretion. We find that between 40 and 80\% of all metals removed from the galactic disk are later reaccreted. The outflows themselves are metal enriched relative to the {ISM} by a factor of 0.2 dex because of the correspondence between sites of metal enrichment and outflows. As a result, the metal mass loading factor scales as eta\_metals {\textbackslash}propto v\_circ{\textasciicircum}-0.91, a somewhat shallower scaling than the total mass loading factor. We analyze the simulated galaxies within the context of analytic chemical evolution models by determining their net metal expulsion efficiencies, which encapsulate the rates of metal loss and reaccretion. We discuss these results in light of the inflow and outflow properties necessary for reproducing the mass-metallicity relation.},

	abstract = {We present results from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey ({KBSS}), a unique spectroscopic survey of the distant universe designed to explore the details of the connection between galaxies and intergalactic baryons within the same survey volumes, focusing particularly on scales from {\textasciitilde}50 kpc to a few Mpc. The {KBSS} is optimized for the redshift range z {\textasciitilde} 2-3, combining S/N {\textasciitilde}100 Keck/{HIRES} spectra of 15 of the brightest {QSOs} in the sky at z {\textasciitilde}= 2.5-2.9 with very densely sampled galaxy redshift surveys within a few arcmin of each {QSO} sightline. In this paper, we present quantitative results on the distribution, column density, kinematics, and absorber line widths of neutral hydrogen (H I) surrounding a subset of 886 {KBSS} star-forming galaxies with 2.0 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 2.8 and with projected distances {\textless}=3 physical Mpc from a {QSO} sightline. Using Voigt profile decompositions of the full Lyα forest region of all 15 {QSO} spectra, we compiled a catalog of {\textasciitilde}6000 individual absorbers in the redshift range of interest, with 12 {\textless}= log (N H I ) {\textless}=21. These are used to measure H I absorption statistics near the redshifts of foreground galaxies as a function of projected galactocentric distance from the {QSO} sightline and for randomly chosen locations in the intergalactic medium ({IGM}) within the survey volume. We find that N H I and the multiplicity of velocity-associated H I components increase rapidly with decreasing galactocentric impact parameter and as the systemic redshift of the galaxy is approached. The strongest H I absorbers within {\textasciitilde}= 100 physical kpc of galaxies have N H I {\textasciitilde}3 orders of magnitude higher than those near random locations in the {IGM}. The circumgalactic zone of most significantly enhanced H I absorption is found within transverse distances of {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 300 kpc and within ±300 km s-1 of galaxy systemic redshifts. Taking this region as the defining bounds of the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}), nearly half of absorbers with log(N H I ) {\textgreater} 15.5 are found within the {CGM} of galaxies meeting our photometric selection criteria, while their {CGM} occupy only 1.5\% of the cosmic volume. The spatial covering fraction, multiplicity of absorption components, and characteristic N H I remain significantly elevated to transverse distances of {\textasciitilde}2 physical Mpc from galaxies in our sample. Absorbers with N H I {\textgreater}1014.5 cm-2 are tightly correlated with the positions of galaxies, while absorbers with lower N H I are correlated with galaxy positions only on {gsimMpc} scales. Redshift anisotropies on these larger scales indicate coherent infall toward galaxy locations, while on scales of {\textasciitilde}100 physical kpc peculiar velocities of Δv {\textasciitilde}= ±260 km s-1 with respect to the galaxies are indicated. The median Doppler widths of individual absorbers within 1-3 r vir of galaxies are larger by {\textasciitilde}= 50\% than randomly chosen absorbers of the same N H I , suggesting higher gas temperatures and/or increased turbulence likely caused by some combination of accretion shocks and galactic winds around galaxies with M halo {\textasciitilde}= 1012 M \&sun; at z {\textasciitilde} 2-3.

Stellar masses are calculated based on optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS}) and atomic gas masses are calculated using atomic hydrogen ({HI}) emission line data from the Arecibo Legacy Fast {ALFA} ({ALFALFA}) survey. By using the technique of abundance matching, we combine the measured baryonic function ({BMF}) of galaxies with the dark matter halo mass function in a {LCDM} universe, in order to determine the galactic baryon fraction as a function of host halo mass. We find that the baryon fraction of low-mass halos is much smaller than the cosmic value, even when atomic gas is taken into account. We find that the galactic baryon deficit increases monotonically with decreasing halo mass, in contrast with previous studies which suggested an approximately constant baryon fraction at the low-mass end. We argue that the observed baryon fractions of low mass halos cannot be explained by reionization heating alone, and that additional feedback mechanisms (e.g. supernova blowout) must be invoked. However, the outflow rates needed to reproduce our result are not easily accommodated in the standard picture of galaxy formation in a {LCDM} universe.},

We compute median-likelihood estimates of these parameters using a large library of model spectra at medium-high resolution, covering a comprehensive range of star formation histories. The constraints we derive are set by the simultaneous fit of five spectral absorption features, which are well reproduced by our population synthesis models. By design, these constraints depend only weakly on the alpha/Fe element abundance ratio. Our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the full range in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to actively star-forming galaxies. We show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence of increasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000AA-break strength (D4000). For galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger Balmer absorption at fixed D4000 is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. We investigate how stellar metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxies old and metal-rich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over the stellar mass range 3x10{\textasciicircum}9{\textless}M/Msun{\textless}3x10{\textasciicircum}10. Both high- and low-concentration galaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellar metallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies of intermediate mass. Despite the large scatter, the relation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies.

We analyse the {SDSS} {MZ} relation with 10 metallicity calibrations, including theoretical and empirical methods. We show that the choice of metallicity calibration has a significant effect on the shape and y-intercept(12+log(O/H)) of the {MZ} relation. The absolute metallicity scale (y-int) varies up to 0.7 dex, depending on the calibration used, and the change in shape is substantial. These results indicate that it is critical to use the same metallicity calibration when comparing different luminosity-metallicity or mass-metallicity relations. We present new metallicity conversions that allow metallicities that have been derived using different strong-line calibrations to be converted to the same base calibration. These conversions facilitate comparisons between different samples, particularly comparisons between galaxies at different redshifts for which different suites of emission-lines are available.Our new conversions successfully remove the large 0.7 dex discrepancies between the metallicity calibrations, and we reach agreement in the {MZ} relation to within 0.03 dex on average. We find that different {AGN} classification methods have negligible effect on the {SDSS} {MZ} relation. We compare the {SDSS} {MZ} relation with nuclear and global relations from the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey ({NFGS}). The turn over of the {MZ} relation depends on aperture covering fraction. We find that a lower redshift limit of z{\textless}0.04 is insufficient for avoiding aperture effects in fiber spectra of the highest stellar mass galaxies.},

Gas becomes increasingly rotationally supported with increasing galaxy mass. In the lowest-mass galaxies (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$), gas fails to form a morphological disk and is primarily dispersion and pressure supported. At intermediate masses (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{8-10\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$), galaxies display a wide range of gas kinematics and morphologies, from thin, rotating disks, to irregular spheroids with negligible net rotation. All the high-mass (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{10-11\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) galaxies form rotationally supported gas disks. Many of the halos whose galaxies fail to form disks harbor high angular momentum gas in their circumgalactic medium. The ratio of the specific angular momentum of gas in the central galaxy to that of the dark-matter halo increases significantly with galaxy mass, from \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gas\}/j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {DM}\}{\textbackslash}sim0.1\$ at \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{6-7\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ to \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gas\}/j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {DM}\}{\textbackslash}sim2\$ at \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{10-11\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. The reduced rotational support in the lowest-mass galaxies owes to (a) stellar feedback and the {UV} background suppressing the accretion of high-angular momentum gas at late times, and (b) stellar feedback driving large non-circular gas motions. We broadly reproduce the observed scaling relations between galaxy mass, gas rotation velocity, size, and angular momentum, but may somewhat underpredict the incidence of disky, high-angular momentum galaxies at the lowest observed masses (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}=(10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}-2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{7\})M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$). In our simulations, stars are uniformly less rotationally supported than gas. The common assumption that stars follow the same rotation curve as gas thus substantially overestimates galaxies' stellar angular momentum, particularly at low masses.},

Of the transitions we analyze, the low-ionization C {III} (977 A) and Si {III} (1207 A) emission lines are the most luminous, with C {IV} (1548 A) and Si {IV} (1394 A) also showing interesting spatially-extended structures. The more massive halos are on average more {UV}-luminous. The {UV} metal line emission from galactic halos in our simulations arises primarily from collisionally ionized gas and is strongly time variable, with peak-to-trough variations of up to {\textasciitilde}2 dex. The peaks of {UV} metal line luminosity correspond closely to massive and energetic mass outflow events, which follow bursts of star formation and inject sufficient energy into galactic halos to power the metal line emission. The strong time variability implies that even some relatively low-mass halos may be detectable. Conversely, flux-limited samples will be biased toward halos whose central galaxy has recently experienced a strong burst of star formation. Spatially-extended {UV} metal line emission around high-redshift galaxies should be detectable by current and upcoming integral field spectrographs such as the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer ({MUSE}) on the Very Large Telescope and Keck Cosmic Web Imager ({KCWI}).},

We present optical emission line spectroscopy of a luminous thick disk H {II} region located at \$z = 860\$ pc above the plane of the spiral galaxy {NGC} 4013 taken with the Multi-Object Double Spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope. This nebula, with an H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosity \${\textbackslash}sim4-7\$ times that of the Orion nebula, surrounds a luminous cluster of young, hot stars that ionize the surrounding interstellar gas of the thick disk, providing a measure of the properties of that gas. We demonstrate that strong emission line methods can provide accurate measures of relative abundances between pairs of H {II} regions. From our emission line spectroscopy, we show that the metal content of the thick disk H {II} region is a factor of \${\textbackslash}approx2\$ lower than gas in H {II} regions at the midplane of this galaxy (with the relative abundance of O in the thick disk lower by \$-0.32{\textbackslash}pm 0.09\$ dex). This implies incomplete mixing of material in the thick disk on small scales (100s of parsecs) and that there is accretion of low-metallicity gas through the thick disks of spirals.

First, we report a very low covering fraction of H I absorption in the {CGM} of these cluster galaxies, f\_c = 25\% +25\%/-15\%, to stringent detection limits (log N(H I) {\textless} 13 cm{\textasciicircum}-2). As field galaxies have an H I covering fraction of {\textasciitilde}100\% at similar radii, the dearth of {CGM} H I in our data indicates that the cluster environment has effectively stripped or overionized the gaseous halos of these cluster galaxies. Second, we assess the contribution of warm-hot (10{\textasciicircum}5 - 10{\textasciicircum}6 K) gas to the {ICM} as traced by O {VI} and broad Ly-alpha ({BLA}) absorption. Despite the high signal-to-noise of our data, we do not detect O {VI} in any cluster, and we only detect {BLA} features in the {QSO} spectrum probing one cluster. We estimate that the total column density of warm-hot gas along this line of sight totals to {\textasciitilde}3\% of that contained in the hot T {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}7 K X-ray emitting phase. Residing at high relative velocities, these features may trace pre-shocked material outside the cluster. Comparing gaseous galaxy halos from the low-density 'field' to galaxy groups and high-density clusters, we find that the {CGM} is progressively depleted of H I with increasing environmental density, and the {CGM} is most severely transformed in galaxy clusters. This {CGM} transformation may play a key role in environmental galaxy quenching.},

We consider {UV} {OVI} {COS}-Halos absorption line data in combination with Milky Way X-ray {OVII} and {OVIII} absorption and emission. We fit these data with a single model representing the {COS}-Halos galaxies and a Galactic corona. Our model is multi-phased, with hot and warm gas components, each with a (turbulent) log-normal distribution of temperatures and densities. The hot gas, traced by the X-ray absorption and emission, is in hydrostatic equilibrium in a Milky Way gravitational potential. The median temperature of the hot gas is \$1.5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}6\${\textasciitilde}K and the mean hydrogen density is \${\textbackslash}sim 5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\}\$. The warm component as traced by the {OVI}, is gas that has cooled out of the high density tail of the hot component. The total warm/hot gas mass is high and is \$1.2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$. The gas metallicity we require to reproduce the oxygen ion column densities is \$0.5\$ solar. The warm {OVI} component has a short cooling time (\${\textbackslash}sim 2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}8\$ years), as hinted by observations. The hot component, however, is \${\textbackslash}sim 80{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the total gas mass and is relatively long-lived, with \$t\_\{cool\} {\textbackslash}sim 7 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}\$ years. Our model supports suggestions that hot galactic coronae can contain significant amounts of gas. These reservoirs may enable galaxies to continue forming stars steadily for long periods of time and account for "missing baryons" in galaxies in the local universe.},

	abstract = {In the absence of galactic winds, the rate at which gas accretes onto galaxies is determined by the gravitational potential and by radiative cooling. However, outflows driven by supernovae and active galactic nuclei not only eject gas from galaxies, but also prevent gas from accreting in the first place. Furthermore, gas previously ejected from a galaxy can re-accrete onto (the same or a different) galaxy. Because this gas has a high metallicity, its cooling rate is relatively high, which will increase its chances to re-accrete. This complex interplay between gas inflows and outflows is discussed in this chapter. Wind recycling is found to be an important process that fuels galaxies at late times and the recycled gas has different properties than gas accreting for the first time. Quantitative conclusions, however, vary between studies, because the amount of wind recycling is dependent on the details of the feedback model. We discuss these differences, known caveats, and ways to make progress in understanding how galaxies are fed at low redshift.},

Using this supposed universal {IMF}, the uncertainty inherent to any observational estimate of the {IMF} is investigated, by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. Determinations of the power-law indices alpha are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star {IMFs} for young star-clusters are systematically steeper by d\_alpha=0.5 between 0.1 and 1 Msun than the Galactic-field {IMF}, which is populated by, on average, about 5 Gyr old stars. The {MFs} in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field {IMF}, and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and absence of associated low-mass stars suggests a radically different {IMF} for this ancient population. Star-formation in higher-metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars.},

Analytical ram-pressure arguments combined with velocities obtained via proper motion studies allow for an estimate of the halo density of the Milky Way at several distances. This halo density is constrained to be greater than 2× 10 −4 –3 × 10 −4 cm −3 out to distances of at least 70 kpc. This is broadly consistent with theoretical models of the diffuse gas in a Milky Way-like halo and is consistent with this component hosting a large fraction of a galaxy's baryons. Accounting for completeness in the dwarf galaxy count, gasless dwarf galaxies could have provided at most 2.1 × 10 8 M of H i gas to the Milky Way, which suggests that most of our Galaxy's star formation fuel does not come from accreted small satellites in the current era.},

At such an extreme radius, the coronal halo gas is an order of magnitude too low to remove H I gas through ram pressure stripping for any reasonable orbit distribution. However, all dwarfs are known to have an ancient stellar population (gsim 10 Gyr) from early epochs of vigorous star formation which, through heating of H I, could allow the hot halo to remove this gas. Our model looks at the evolution of these dwarf galaxies analytically as the host-galaxy dark matter halo and coronal halo gas build up over cosmic time. The dwarf galaxies—treated as spherically symmetric, smooth distributions of dark matter and gas—experience early star formation, which sufficiently heats the gas, allowing it to be removed easily through tidal stripping by the host galaxy, or ram pressure stripping by a tenuous hot halo (n H = 3 × 10-4 cm-3 at 50 kpc). This model of evolution is able to explain the observed radial distribution of gas-deficient and gas-rich dwarfs around the Galaxy and M31 if the dwarfs fell in at high redshift (z {\textasciitilde} 3-10).},

The structure of the galaxy models and the orbital configurations are chosen in accordance to those expected in a {LCDM} Universe.While tidal stirring of disky dwarfs produces objects whose stellar structure and kinematics resembles that of dwarf spheroidals after a few orbits, ram pressure stripping is needed to entirely remove their gas component. Gravitational tides can aid ram pressure stripping by diminishing the overall potential of the dwarf, but tides also induce bar formation which funnels gas inwards making subsequent stripping more difficult. This inflow is particularly effective when the gas can cool radiatively. Assuming a low density of the hot Galactic corona consistent with observational constraints, dwarfs with V\_\{peak\} {\textless} 30 km/s can be completely stripped of their gas content on orbits with pericenters of 50 kpc or less. Instead, dwarfs with more massive dark haloes and V\_\{peak\} {\textgreater} 30 km/s lose most or all of their gas content only if a heating source keeps the gas extended, partially counteracting the bar-driven inflow. We show that the ionizing radiation from the cosmic {UV} background at z {\textgreater} 2 can provide the required heating. In these objects most of the gas is removed or becomes ionized at the first pericenter passage,explaining the early truncation of the star formation observed in Draco and Ursa Minor.

The gist of the model is that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.},

Along with the serial version of the code, we discuss a parallel version that has been designed to run on massively parallel supercomputers with distributed memory. While both versions use a tree algorithm to compute gravitational forces, the serial version of {GADGET} can optionally employ the special-purpose hardware {GRAPE} instead of the tree. Periodic boundary conditions are supported by means of an Ewald summation technique. The code uses individual and adaptive timesteps for all particles, and it combines this with a scheme for dynamic tree updates. Due to its Lagrangian nature, {GADGET} thus allows a very large dynamic range to be bridged, both in space and time. So far, {GADGET} has been successfully used to run simulations with up to 7.5e7 particles, including cosmological studies of large-scale structure formation, high-resolution simulations of the formation of clusters of galaxies, as well as workstation-sized problems of interacting galaxies. In this study, we detail the numerical algorithms employed, and show various tests of the code. We publically release both the serial and the massively parallel version of the code.},

The `standard-resolution' simulations systematically underestimate {HI} column densities, leading to an {HI} deficiency in low-mass (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) galaxies and poor reproduction of the observed {HI} mass function. These shortcomings are largely absent from {EAGLE} simulations featuring a factor of 8 (2) better mass (spatial) resolution, within which the {HI} mass of galaxies evolves more mildly from \$z=1\$ to \$0\$ than in the standard-resolution simulations. The largest-volume simulation reproduces the observed clustering of {HI} systems, and its dependence on {HI}-richness. At fixed \$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$, galaxies acquire more {HI} in simulations with stronger feedback, as they become associated with more massive haloes and higher infall rates. They acquire less {HI} in simulations with a greater star formation efficiency, since the star formation and feedback necessary to balance the infall rate is produced by smaller gas reservoirs. The simulations indicate that the {HI} of present-day galaxies was acquired primarily by the smooth accretion of ionized, intergalactic gas at \$z{\textbackslash}simeq1\$, which later self-shields, and that only a small fraction is contributed by the reincorporation of gas previously heated strongly by feedback. {HI} reservoirs are highly dynamic: over \$40\$ percent of {HI} associated with \$z=0.1\$ galaxies is converted to stars or ejected by \$z=0\$.},

Our analysis uses data from {SDSS} Data Release 7, selecting candidate {MW}-like hosts from the spectroscopic catalog and candidate analogs of the Magellanic Clouds from the photometric catalog. Our principal result is the probability for an {MW}-like galaxy to host N sat close satellites with luminosities similar to the Magellanic Clouds. We find that 81\% of galaxies like the {MW} have no such satellites within a radius of 150 kpc, 11\% have one, and only 3.5\% of hosts have two. The probabilities are robust to changes in host and satellite selection criteria, background-estimation technique, and survey depth. These results demonstrate that the {MW} has significantly more satellites than a typical galaxy of its luminosity; this fact is useful for understanding the larger cosmological context of our home galaxy.},

H I observations of the Milky Way and other nearby spirals have revealed the presence of such gas in the form of clouds and other extended structures, which indicates ongoing accretion. We use a high-resolution simulation (136-272 pc throughout) to study the distribution of cold gas in the halo, compare it with observations, and examine its origin. The amount ({\textasciitilde}108 M ⊙ in H I), covering fraction, and spatial distribution of the cold halo gas around the simulated galaxy at z = 0 are consistent with existing observations. At z = 0, the H I mass accretion rate onto the disk is 0.2 M ⊙ yr-1. We track the histories of the 20 satellites that are detected in H I in the redshift interval 0.5 \&gt; z \&gt; 0 and find that most of them are losing gas, with a median mass-loss rate per satellite of 3.1 × 10-3 M ⊙ yr-1. This stripped gas is a significant component of the H I gas seen in the simulation. In addition, we see filamentary material coming into the halo from the intergalactic medium at all redshifts. Most of this gas does not make it directly to the disk, but part of the gas in these structures is able to cool and form clouds. The metallicity of the gas allows us to distinguish between filamentary flows and satellite gas. We find that the former accounts for at least 25\%-75\% of the cold gas in the halo seen at any redshift analyzed here. Placing constraints on cloud formation mechanisms allows us to better understand how galaxies accrete gas and fuel star formation at z = 0.},

	abstract = {The standard treatment of cooling in Cold Dark Matter halos assumes that all of the gas within a ``cooling radius'' cools and contracts monolithically to fuel galaxy formation. Here we take into account the expectation that the hot gas in galactic halos is thermally unstable and prone to fragmentation during cooling and show that the implications are more far-reaching than previously expected: allowing multi-phase cooling fundamentally alters expectations about gas infall in halos and naturally explains the bright-end cutoff in the galaxy luminosity function. We argue that cooling should proceed via the formation of high-density, 10{\textasciicircum}4 K clouds, pressure-confined within a hot gas background. The background medium has a low density, and can survive as a stable corona with a long cooling time. The fraction of baryons contained in the residual hot core grows with halo mass because the cooling density increases, and this leads to an upper-mass limit in quiescent, non-merged galaxies of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun. In this scenario, galaxy formation is fueled by the infall of pressure-supported clouds. For Milky-Way-size systems, clouds of mass {\textasciitilde} 5x10{\textasciicircum}6 Msun that formed or merged within the last several Gyrs should still exist as a residual population in the halo, with a total mass in clouds of {\textasciitilde} 2 x 10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun. The mass of the Milky Way galaxy is explained naturally in this model, and is a factor of two smaller than would result in the standard treatment without feedback. We expect clouds in galactic halos to be {\textasciitilde} 1 kpc in size and to extend {\textasciitilde}150 kpc from galactic centers. The predicted properties of clouds match well the observed radial velocities, angular sizes, column densities, and velocity widths of High Velocity Clouds around our Galaxy. The clouds also explain high-ion absorption systems at z{\textless}1.},

This implies {\textasciitilde}10\% have a satellite within the distance of the {LMC}, and {\textasciitilde}40\% of L* galaxies host a bright satellite within the virialized extent of their dark matter halos. Remarkably, the simulation reproduces the observed frequency, radial dependence, velocity distribution, and luminosity function of observed secondaries exceptionally well, suggesting that {LCDM} provides an accurate reproduction of the observed Universe to galaxies as faint as L{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}9 Lsun on {\textasciitilde}50 kpc scales. When stacked, the observed projected pairwise velocity dispersion of these satellites is sigma{\textasciitilde}160 km/s, in agreement with abundance-matching expectations for their host halo masses. Finally, bright satellites around L* primaries are significantly redder than typical galaxies in their luminosity range, indicating that environmental quenching is operating within galaxy-size dark matter halos that typically contain only a single bright satellite. This redness trend is in stark contrast to the Milky Way's {LMC}, which is unusually blue even for a field galaxy.

We examine both isolated dwarf galaxies and those that are satellites of a Milky Way-mass galaxy. In particular, we study the effects of including a sub-grid turbulent model for the diffusion of metals in gas. Simulations that include diffusion have narrower {MDFs} and abundance ratio distributions, because diffusion drives individual gas and star particles toward the average metallicity. This effect provides significantly better agreement with observed abundance distributions of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, including the small intrinsic scatter in [\$\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] (less than 0.1 dex). This small intrinsic scatter arises in our simulations because the interstellar medium ({ISM}) in dwarf galaxies is well-mixed at nearly all cosmic times, such that stars that form at a given time have similar abundances to within 0.1 dex. Thus, most of the scatter in abundances at z = 0 arises from redshift evolution and not from instantaneous scatter in the {ISM}. We find similar {MDF} widths and intrinsic scatter for satellite and isolated dwarf galaxies, which suggests that environmental effects play a minor role compared with internal chemical evolution in our simulations. Overall, with the inclusion of metal diffusion, our simulations reproduce abundance distribution widths of observed low-mass galaxies, enabling detailed studies of chemical evolution in galaxy formation.},

The initial sample consists of 13 galaxy and absorber pairs and 10 galaxies that do not produce Mg {II} absorption lines to within sensitive upper limits. The redshifts of the galaxy and absorber pairs range from z=0.2067 to 0.892 with a median of z=0.3818. We find that galaxies at larger impact parameters produce on average weaker Mg {II} absorbers. This anticorrelation is substantially improved when accounting for the intrinsic luminosities of individual galaxies. In addition, there exists a distinct boundary at ρ=Rgas, beyond which no Mg {II} absorbers are found. A maximum likelihood analysis shows that the observations are best described by an isothermal density profile and a scaling relation Rgas=91({LB}/{LB}*)0.35+/-0.05 h-1 kpc [or 69 h-1 kpc at W(2796)=0.3 Å] with a mean covering factor of {\textless}κ{\textgreater}=80\%-86\%. Together with the scaling relation between halo mass and galaxy luminosity inferred from halo occupation studies, this scaling of Rgas indicates that gas radius is a fixed fraction of the dark matter halo radius. We compare our results with previous studies and discuss the implications of our analysis for constraining the baryon content of galactic halos and for discriminating between competing scenarios for understanding the nature of the extended gas.},

Our initial study focuses specifically on Mg {II} absorbers. We construct a model of the gaseous content in which the absorption equivalent width Wr is determined by the amount of cold gas, in the form of discrete clouds, along a sight line through a halo. The two quantities that we specify per halo in the model are (1) the mean absorption strength per unit surface mass density {AW}(M), and (2) the mean covering factor κg(M) of the gaseous clouds. These parameters determine the conditional probability distribution of Wr as a function of halo mass, P(Wr{\textbar}M). Two empirical measurements are applied to constrain the model: (1) the absorber frequency distribution function and (2) the Wr-dependent clustering amplitude. We find that the data demand a rapid transition in the gas content of halos at {\textasciitilde}1011.5 h-1 Msolar, below which halos contain predominantly cold gas and beyond which gas becomes predominantly hot. In order to reproduce the observed overall strong clustering of the absorbers and the anticorrelation between Wr and halo mass M, roughly 5\% of gas in halos up to 1014 h-1 Msolar is required to be cold. The gas covering factor is near unity over a wide range of halo masses, supporting the idea that Mg {II} systems probe an unbiased sample of typical galaxies.

We find very little difference in the total amount of gas removed from the unmagnetized and magnetized galaxies, although a magnetic field with a radial component will initially accelerate stripped gas more quickly. In general, we find that magnetic fields in the disk lead to slower velocities in the stripped gas near the disk and faster velocities farther from the disk. We also find that magnetic fields in the galactic gas lead to larger unmixed structures in the tail. Finally, we discuss whether ram pressure stripped tails can magnetize the {ICM}. We find that the total magnetic energy density grows as the tail lengthens, likely through turbulence. There are μG-strength fields in the tail in all of our {MHD} runs, which survive to at least 100 kpc from the disk (the edge of our simulated region), indicating that the area-filling factor of magnetized tails in a cluster could be large.},

We include radiative cooling in an adaptive hydrocode in order to investigate the impact of a clumpy, multi-phase interstellar medium. We find that including cooling results in a very different morphology for the gas in the tail, with a much wider range of temperatures and densities. The tail is significantly narrower in runs with radiative cooling, in agreement with observed wakes. In addition, we make detailed predictions of H I, Halpha and X-ray emission for the wake, showing that we generally expect detectable H I and Halpha signatures, but no observable X-ray emission (at least for our chosen ram-pressure strength and {ICM} conditions). We find that the relative strength of the Halpha diagnostic depends somewhat on our adopted minimum temperature floor (below which we set cooling to zero to mimic physics processes not included in the simulation).},

Given the updated velocities, cosmological simulations of hierarchical structure formation favour a scenario where the Magellanic Clouds ({MCs}) are currently on their first infall towards {ourGalaxy}. We illustrate here that the observed irregular morphology and internal kinematics of the Magellanic System (in gas and stars) are naturally explained by interactions between the {LMC} and {SMC}, rather than gravitational interactions with the {MW}. These conclusions provide further support that the {MCs} are completing their first infall to our system. In particular, we demonstrate that the Magellanic Stream, a band of H I gas trailing behind the Clouds 150{\textbackslash},{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\} across the sky, can be accounted for by the action of {LMC} tides on the {SMC} before the system was accreted by the {MW}. We further demonstrate that the off-centre, warped stellar bar of the {LMC}, and its one-armed spiral can be naturally explained by a recent direct collision with its lower mass companion, the {SMC}. Such structures are key morphological characteristics of a class of galaxies referred to as Magellanic Irregulars, the majority of which are not associated with massive spiral galaxies. We infer that dwarf-dwarf galaxy interactions are important drivers for the morphological evolution of Magellanic Irregulars and can dramatically affect the efficiency of baryon removal from dwarf galaxies via the formation of extended tidal bridges and tails. Such interactions are not only important for the evolution of dwarf galaxies but also have direct consequences for the build-up of baryons in our own {MW}, as {LMC}-mass systems are believed to be the dominant building blocks of {MW}-type haloes.},

This decomposition exposes the {MS} to be composed of two filaments distinct both spatially (as first pointed out by Putman et al.) and in velocity. Using the velocity coherence of the filaments, one can be traced back to its origin in what we identify as the {SouthEast} {HI} Overdensity ({SEHO}) of the Large Magellanic Cloud ({LMC}), which includes 30 Doradus. Parts of the Leading Arm ({LA}) can also be traced back to the {SEHO} in velocity and position. Therefore, at least one-half of the trailing Stream and most of the {LA} originates in the {LMC}, contrary to previous assertions that both the {MS} and the {LA} originate in the Small Magellanic Cloud ({SMC}) and/or in the Magellanic Bridge. The two {MS} filaments show strong periodic, undulating spatial and velocity patterns that we speculate are an imprint of the {LMC} rotation curve. If true, then the drift rate of the Stream gas away from the Magellanic Clouds is {\textasciitilde}49 km/s and the age of the {MS} is {\textasciitilde}1.74 Gyr. The Staveley-Smith et al. high-resolution {HI} data of the {LMC} show gas outflows from supergiant shells in the {SEHO} that seem to be creating the {LA} and {LMC} filament of the {MS}. Blowout of {LMC} gas is an effect not previously accounted for but one that probably plays an important role in creating the {MS} and {LA}.},

We show that the interaction between Small Magellanic Clouds ({SMC}) and Large Magellanic Clouds results in both a spatial and kinematical bifurcation of both the stream and the leading arm. The spatial bifurcation of the stream is readily apparent in the {HIPASS} data, and the kinematical bifurcation is also tentatively identified. This bifurcation provides strong support for the tidal disruption origin for the Magellanic stream. A fiducial model for the Magellanic Clouds ({MCs}) is presented upon completion of an extensive parameter survey of the potential orbital configurations of the {MCs} and the viable initial boundary conditions for the disc of the {SMC}.

We find that even in this relatively quiescent region gas flows away from the disk at speeds up to ∼100 km s −1 in broad and symmetrical absorption in the low and high ions. The symmetric absorption profiles combined with previous surveys showing little evidence that the ejected gas returns to the {LMC} and provide compelling evidence that the {LMC} drives a global, large-scale outflow across its disk, which is the likely result of a recent burst of star formation in the {LMC}. We find that the outflowing gas is multiphase, ionized by both photoionization (Si ii and Si iii) and collisional ionization (Si iv and C iv). We estimate a total mass and outflow rate to be 10 7 M and 0.4 M yr −1 . Since the velocity of this large-scale outflow does not reach the {LMC} escape velocity, the gas removal is likely aided by either ram-pressure stripping with the Milky Way halo or tidal interactions with the surrounding galaxies, implying that the environment of {LMC}-like or dwarf galaxies plays an important role in their ultimate gas starvation. Finally we reassess the mass and plausible origins of the high-velocity complex toward the {LMC} given its newly-determined distance that places it in the lower Milky Way halo and sky-coverage that shows it extends well beyond the {LMC} disk.},

In this review, we present an experimental summary of the ground state properties of the {XY} pyrochlores, including evidence that they are strongly influenced by phase competition. We empirically demonstrate the signatures for phase competition in a frustrated magnet: multiple heat capacity anomalies, suppressed \$T\_N\$ or \$T\_C\$, sample and pressure dependent ground states, and unconventional spin dynamics.},

	abstract = {Galactic winds and fountains driven by supernova-heated gas play an integral role in re-distributing gas in galaxies, depositing metals in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}), and quenching star formation. The interplay between these outflows and ram pressure stripping due to the galaxy's motion through an ambient medium may enhance these effects by converting fountain flows into expelled gas. In this paper, we present controlled, 3D simulations of ram pressure stripping combined with thermally driven, local outflows from clustered supernovae in an isolated disk galaxy modeled on the Large Magellanic Cloud ({LMC}), a dwarf satellite of the Milky Way on its first infall. Observational evidence of local outflows emanating from supergiant shells in the {LMC} and a trailing filament of {HI} gas originating from these regions - with no obvious Leading Arm counterpart - may represent a perfect example of this process. Our simulations present a proof-of-concept that ram pressure can convert fountain flows into expelled gas. We find that fountains launched near the peak star formation time of the {LMC} can comprise part of the {LMC} filament in the Trailing Stream, but with lower column densities than observed. Larger, more numerous outflows from the {LMC} may be possible and may contribute more mass, but higher inertia gas will lengthen the timescale for this gas to be swept away by ram pressure. Given the high resolution observations, increased knowledge of star formation histories, and growing evidence of multiphase, ionized outflows, the {LMC} is an ideal test-bed for future wind models.},

	abstract = {Galaxy evolution is affected by competing feedback processes. Stellar feedback dominates in low-mass galaxies, while {AGN} feedback predominantly affects massive ones. Recent observational results reveal the dependence of black hole accretion rate ({BHAR}) and star formation rate ({SFR}) on galaxy stellar mass, and give information on the galaxy mass at which the changeover between dominant feedback mechanisms occurs. I use this information to derive an empirical estimate of the coupling efficiency, \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {AGN}\}\$, between {AGN} luminous energy output and {AGN}-driven galactic outflows, and the momentum loading factor \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm p,{AGN}\}\$ between the momentum of {AGN} radiation field and the outflow. The results are independent of any particular model of {AGN} feedback and show that {AGN} feedback must be very efficient and/or have very large momentum loading in order to explain current observations. I discuss possible ways of reaching the required efficiency and loading factor, and the selection effects that might result in only weak outflows being observed, while the most powerful ones may be generally obscured. There are significant uncertainties involved in the derivation of the result; I suggest ways of reducing them. In the near future, better estimates of coupling efficiency can help distinguish among {AGN} feedback models, investigate the redshift evolution and mass dependence of feedback efficiency.},

A theoretical solution to this paradox locates the missing baryons in the hot and tenuous filamentary gas between galaxies, known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium. However, it is difficult to detect them there because the largest by far constituent of this gas - hydrogen - is mostly ionized and therefore almost invisible in far-ultraviolet spectra with typical signal-to-noise ratios. Indeed, despite the large observational efforts, only a few marginal claims of detection have been made so far. Here we report observations of two absorbers of highly ionized oxygen ({OVII}) in the high signal-to-noise-ratio X-ray spectrum of a quasar at redshift {\textgreater}0.4. These absorbers show no variability over a 2-year timescale and have no associated cold absorption, making the assumption that they originate from the quasar's intrinsic outflow or the host galaxy's interstellar medium implausible. The {OVII} systems lie in regions characterized by large (x4 compared to average) galaxy over-densities and their number (down to the sensitivity threshold of our data), agrees well with numerical simulation predictions for the long-sought warm-hot intergalactic medium ({WHIM}). We conclude that the missing baryons have been found.},

The Galaxy is a luminous (L-star) barred spiral with a central box/peanut bulge, a dominant disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. Based on global properties, it falls in the sparsely populated "green valley" region of the galaxy colour-magnitude diagram. Here we review the key integrated, structural and kinematic parameters of the Galaxy, and point to uncertainties as well as directions for future progress.

I further address how these changes reveal galaxy formation processes that galaxy structural analyses can provide. This review is pedagogical and begins with a detailed discussion of the major methods in which galaxies are studied morphologically and structurally. This includes the well-established visual method; Sersic fitting to measure galaxy sizes and surface brightness profile shapes; non-parametric structural methods including the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S) ({CAS}) method, as well as newer structural indices. Included is a discussion of how these structural indices measure fundamental properties of galaxies such as their scale, star formation rate, and ongoing merger activity. Extensive observational results are shown demonstrating how broad galaxy morphologies and structures change with time up to z{\textasciitilde}3, from small, compact and peculiar systems in the distant universe to the formation of the Hubble sequence we find today. This review further addresses how structural methods measure accurately the merger history out to z{\textasciitilde}3. The properties and evolution of bulges, disks, bars, and at z{\textgreater}1 large star forming clumps are also described, along with how morphological galaxy quenching occurs. Furthermore, the role of environment in producing structure in galaxies over cosmic time is treated. Alongside the evolution of general structure, I also delineate how galaxy sizes change with time, with measured sizes up to a factor of 2-5 smaller at high redshift at a given stellar mass. This review concludes with a discussion of how galaxy structure reveals the formation mechanisms behind galaxies, providing a new and unique way to test theories of galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations have become a major tool for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies and galaxy populations from well defined initial conditions with realistic abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies since observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circum-glactic presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic 'feedback' from massive stars and accreting super-massive black holes - generally unresolved in cosmological simulations - plays a major role for driving galactic outflows, which have been shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large variety of plausible sub-resolution models succeeds in this exercise. They capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e. outflows regulating galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review we focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star formation and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely describe the multi-phase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently unresolved few hundred parsecs scales of large scale cosmological simulations. Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting black holes, an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the non-thermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and cosmic rays.},

Starting at z=4 from identical initial conditions, implementations of weak and strong stellar feedback produce bulge- and disc-dominated galaxies, respectively. Strong feedback favours disc formation: (1) because conversion of gas into stars is suppressed at early times, as required by abundance matching arguments, resulting in flat star formation histories and higher gas fractions; (2) because 50\% of the stars form in situ from recycled disc gas with angular momentum only weakly related to that of the z=0 dark halo; (3) because late-time gas accretion is typically an order of magnitude stronger and has higher specific angular momentum, with recycled gas dominating over primordial infall; (4) because 25-30\% of the total accreted gas is ejected entirely before z{\textasciitilde}1, removing primarily low angular momentum material which enriches the nearby inter-galactic medium. Most recycled gas roughly conserves its angular momentum, but material ejected for long times and to large radii can gain significant angular momentum before re-accretion.

We connect the orbital structure to the formation histories and specific features (e.g. disk, counter-rotating core, minor axis rotation) in two-dimensional kinematic maps. Globally, fast rotating galaxies with significant recent in-situ star formation are dominated by z-tubes. Slow rotators with recent mergers have significant box orbit and x-tube components. Rotation, quanti- fied by the λR-parameter often originates from streaming motion of stars on z-tubes but sometimes from figure rotation. The observed anti-correlation of h3 and V0/σ in rotating galaxies can be connected to a dissipative formation history leading to high z-tube fractions. For galaxies with recent mergers in-situ formed stars, accreted stars and dark matter particles populate similar orbits. Dark matter particles have isotropic velocity dispersions. Accreted stars are typically radially biased (β ≈ 0.2 − 0.4). In- situ stars become tangentially biased (as low as β ≈ −1.0) if dissipation was relevant during the late assembly of the galaxy.

Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have recently reproduced this similarity in large galaxy samples by including strong galactic winds, but the exact mechanism that achieves this is not yet clear. Here we present an analysis of key aspects contributing to this relation: angular momentum selection and evolution of Lagrangian mass elements as they accrete onto dark matter halos, condense into Milky Way-scale galaxies, and join the \$z=0\$ stellar phase. We contrast this evolution in the Illustris simulation with that in a simulation without galactic winds, where the \$z=0\$ angular momentum is \${\textbackslash}approx0.6\$ dex lower. We find that winds induce differences between these simulations in several ways: increasing angular momentum, preventing angular momentum loss, and causing \$z=0\$ stars to sample the accretion-time angular momentum distribution of baryons in a biased way. In both simulations, gas loses on average \${\textbackslash}approx0.4\$ dex between accreting onto halos and first accreting onto central galaxies. In Illustris, this is followed by \${\textbackslash}approx0.2\$ dex gains in the `galactic wind fountain' and no further net evolution past the final accretion onto the galaxy. Without feedback, further losses of \${\textbackslash}approx0.2\$ dex occur in the gas phase inside the galaxies. An additional \${\textbackslash}approx0.15\$ dex difference arises from feedback preferentially selecting higher angular momentum gas at accretion by expelling gas that is poorly aligned. These and additional effects of similar magnitude are discussed, suggesting a complex origin of the similarity between the specific angular momenta of galactic disks and typical halos.},

	abstract = {We develop a new method {StarGO} (Stars' Galactic Origin) to identify the galactic origins of halo stars using their kinematics. Our method is based on self-organizing map ({SOM}), which is one of the most popular unsupervised learning algorithms. {StarGO} combines {SOM} with a novel adaptive group identification algorithm with essentially no free parameters. In order to evaluate our model, we build a synthetic stellar halo from mergers of nine satellites in the Milky Way. We construct the mock catalogue by extracting a heliocentric volume of 10 kpc from our simulations and assigning expected observational uncertainties corresponding to bright stars from Gaia {DR}2 and {LAMOST} {DR}5. We compare the results from {StarGO} against that from a Friends-of-Friends ({FoF}) based method in the space of orbital energy and angular momentum. We show that {StarGO} is able to systematically identify more satellites and achieve higher number fraction of identified stars for most of the satellites within the extracted volume. When applied to data from Gaia {DR}2, {StarGO} will enable us to reveal the origins of the inner stellar halo in unprecedented detail.},

	abstract = {We study the effects of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability ({KHI}) on the cold streams that feed high-redshift galaxies through their hot haloes, generalizing our earlier analyses of a 2D slab to a 3D cylinder. Our analysis combines analytic modeling and numerical simulations in the linear and non-linear regimes. For streams that are subsonic or transonic with respect to the halo sound speed, the instability in 3D is qualitatively similar to that in 2D, except that it progresses at a faster pace. For supersonic streams, the instability grows much faster in 3D and it can be qualitatively different due to 3D azimuthal modes, which introduce a strong dependence on the initial width of the transition region between the stream and the background. Overall, the upper limit for the radius of a stream that disintegrates prior to reaching the central galaxy is larger by 70\% than the 2D estimate; it is in the range 0.5-5\% of the halo virial radius, decreasing with increasing stream density and velocity. Stream disruption generates a turbulent mixing zone around the stream with velocities at the level of 40\% of the initial stream velocity. Contrary to the 2D estimates, we find that in 3D the {KHI} can lead to significant stream deceleration and energy dissipation. For typical streams, 30-70\% of the gravitational energy gained by the inflow down the dark-matter halo potential well can be dissipated, capable of powering Lyman-alpha blobs.},

	abstract = {The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate. As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them. Here, we consider the likely response of a highly advanced civilization to this situation. In particular, we argue that in order to maximize its access to useable energy, a sufficiently advanced civilization would chose to expand rapidly outward, build Dyson Spheres or similar structures around encountered stars, and use the energy that is harnessed to accelerate those stars away from the approaching horizon and toward the center of the civilization. We find that such efforts will be most effective for stars with masses in the range of \$M{\textbackslash}sim (0.2-1) M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, and could lead to the harvesting of stars within a region extending out to several tens of Mpc in radius, potentially increasing the total amount of energy that is available to a future civilization by a factor of several thousand. We also discuss the observable signatures of a civilization elsewhere in the universe that is currently in this state of stellar harvesting.},

The emission measure varies by an order of magnitude and marginally correlates with the Galactic latitude. Despite the large scatter of the data, the emission measure distribution is roughly reproduced by a disk-like density distribution with a scale length of \${\textbackslash}sim7\$ kpc, a scale height of \${\textbackslash}sim2\$ kpc, and a total mass of \${\textbackslash}sim5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}7\$ \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$.

Combined with indirect evidence of an extended gaseous halo from other observations, the hot gaseous halo likely consists of a dense disk-like component and a rarefied spherical component; the X-ray emissions primarily come from the former but the mass is dominated by the latter. The disk-like component likely originates from stellar feedback in the Galactic disk due to the low scale height and the large scatter of the emission measures. The median [O/Fe] of \${\textbackslash}sim0.25\$ shows the contribution of the core-collapse supernovae and supports the stellar feedback origin.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04233},
	abstract = {One important result from recent large integral field spectrograph ({IFS}) surveys is that the intrinsic velocity dispersion of galaxies traced by star-forming gas increases with redshift. Massive, rotation-dominated discs are already in place at z{\textasciitilde}2, but they are dynamically hotter than spiral galaxies in the local Universe. Although several plausible mechanisms for this elevated velocity dispersion (e.g. star formation feedback, elevated gas supply, or more frequent galaxy interactions) have been proposed, the fundamental driver of the velocity dispersion enhancement at high redshift remains unclear. We investigate the origin of this kinematic evolution using a suite of cosmological simulations from the {FIRE} (Feedback In Realistic Environments) project. Although {IFS} surveys generally cover a wider range of stellar masses than in these simulations, the simulated galaxies show trends between intrinsic velocity dispersion, {SFR}, and redshift in agreement with observations. In both the observed and simulated galaxies, intrinsic velocity dispersion is positively correlated with {SFR}. Intrinsic velocity dispersion increases with redshift out to z{\textasciitilde}1 and then flattens beyond that. In the {FIRE} simulations, intrinsic velocity dispersion can vary significantly on timescales of {\textless}100 Myr. These variations closely mirror the time evolution of the {SFR} and gas inflow rate. By cross-correlating pairs of intrinsic velocity dispersion, gas inflow rate, and {SFR}, we show that increased gas inflow leads to subsequent enhanced star formation, and enhancements in intrinsic velocity dispersion tend to temporally coincide with increases in gas inflow rate and {SFR}.},

	abstract = {We study the interplay among cooling, heating, conduction, and magnetic fields in gravitationally stratified plasmas using simplified, plane-parallel numerical simulations. Since the physical heating mechanism remains uncertain in massive halos such as groups or clusters, we adopt a simple, observationally-motivated prescription which enforces global thermal equilibrium when averaged over large scales. The plasma remains susceptible to local thermal instability, however, and cooling drives an inward flow of material. In contrast to previous results, we argue that the thermal stability of the plasma is independent of its convective stability. We find that the ratio of the cooling timescale to the dynamical timescale t\_cool/t\_ff controls the saturation of the thermal instability: when t\_cool/t\_ff {\textless} 1, the plasma develops extended multi-phase structure, whereas when t\_cool / t\_ff {\textgreater} 1 it does not. (In a companion paper, we show that the criterion for thermal instability in a spherical potential is somewhat less stringent, t\_cool / t\_ff {\textless} 10.) When thermal conduction is anisotropic with respect to the magnetic field, the criterion for multi-phase structure is essentially independent of the thermal conductivity of the plasma. Our criterion for local thermal instability to produce multi-phase structure is an extension of the cold vs. hot accretion modes in galaxy formation that applies at all radii in hot halos, not just to the virial shock. We show that this criterion is consistent with data on multi-phase gas in the {ACCEPT} sample of clusters; in addition, when t\_cool / t\_ff {\textgreater} 1, the net cooling rate to low temperatures and the mass flux to small radii are suppressed enough relative to models without heating to be qualitatively consistent with star formation rates and x-ray line emission in groups and clusters.},

	abstract = {Several models have predicted that stars could form inside galactic outflows and that this would be a new major mode of galaxy evolution. Observations of galactic outflows have revealed that they host large amounts of dense and clumpy molecular gas, which provide conditions suitable for star formation. We have investigated the properties of the outflows in a large sample of galaxies by exploiting the integral field spectroscopic data of the large {MaNGA}-{SDSS}4 galaxy survey. We find that star formation occurs inside at least half of the galactic outflows in our sample. We also show that even if star formation is prominent inside many other galactic outflows, this may have not been revealed as the diagnostics are easily dominated by the presence of even faint {AGN} and shocks. If very massive outflows typical of distant galaxies and quasars follow the same scaling relations observed locally, then the star formation inside high-z outflows can be up to several 100 Msun/yr and could contribute substantially to the early formation of the spheroidal component of galaxies. Star formation in outflows can also potentially contribute to establishing the scaling relations between black holes and their host spheroids. Moreover, supernovae exploding on large orbits can chemically enrich in-situ and heat the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium. Finally, young stars ejected on large orbits may also contribute to the reionization of the Universe.},

	abstract = {We propose a simple analytic model to understand when star formation is time-steady versus bursty in galaxies. Recent models explain the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation between star formation rate and gas surface densities in galaxies as resulting from a balance between stellar feedback and gravity. We argue that bursty star formation occurs when such an equilibrium cannot be stably sustained, and identify two regimes in which galaxy-scale star formation should be bursty: i) at high redshift (z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1) for galaxies of all masses, and ii) at low masses (depending on gas fraction) for galaxies at any redshift. At high redshift, characteristic galactic dynamical timescales become too short for supernova feedback to effectively respond to gravitational collapse in galactic discs (an effect recently identified for galactic nuclei), whereas in dwarf galaxies star formation occurs in too few bright star-forming regions to effectively average out. Burstiness is also enhanced at high redshift owing to elevated gas fractions in the early Universe. Our model can thus explain the bursty star formation rates predicted in these regimes by recent high-resolution galaxy formation simulations, as well as the bursty star formation histories observationally-inferred in both local dwarf and high-redshift galaxies. In our model, bursty star formation is associated with particularly strong spatio-temporal clustering of supernovae. Such clustering can promote the formation of galactic winds and our model may thus also explain the much higher wind mass loading factors inferred in high-redshift massive galaxies relative to their z{\textasciitilde}0 counterparts.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces Colossus, a public, open-source python package for calculations related to cosmology, the large-scale structure of matter in the universe, and the properties of dark matter halos. The code is designed to be fast and easy to use, with a coherent, well-documented user interface. The cosmology module implements {FLRW} cosmologies including curvature, relativistic species, and different dark energy equations of state, and provides fast computations of the linear matter power spectrum, variance, and correlation function. The large-scale structure module is concerned with the properties of peaks in Gaussian random fields and halos in a statistical sense, including their peak height, peak curvature, halo bias, and mass function. The halo module deals with spherical overdensity radii and masses, density profiles, concentration, and the splashback radius. To facilitate the rapid exploration of these quantities, Colossus implements about 40 different fitting functions from the literature. I discuss the core routines in detail, with a particular emphasis on their accuracy. Colossus is available at bitbucket.org/bdiemer/colossus.},

We find that the analytic formulae provide a good description of the relations between three of the four numerical quantities. The fourth (luminosity) also agrees once we introduce a procedure to correct for the fixed numerical resolution. We also compute the normalizations for the virial relations and compare extensively to the existing literature, finding remarkably good agreement. The Press-Schechter prescription is calibrated with the simulations, again finding results consistent with other authors. We also examine related issues such as the size of the scatter in the virial relations, the effect of metallicity with a fixed pass-band, and the structure of the halos. All of this is done in order to establish a firm groundwork for the use of clusters as cosmological probes. Implications for the models are briefly discussed.},

We apply a multi-element analysis to quantify the amount of dust in these two classes of systems. We find that either the element depletion patterns in these systems differ from the Galactic depletion patterns or they have a different nucleosynthetic history than our own Galaxy. We propose a new method to derive the velocity width of absorption profiles, using the modeled Voigt profile features. The correlation between the velocity width delta\_V90 of the absorption profile and the metallicity is found to be tighter for {DLAs} than for sub-{DLAs}. We report hints of a bimodal distribution in the [Fe/H] metallicity of low redshift (z {\textless} 1.25) sub-{DLAs}, which is unseen at higher redshifts. This feature can be interpreted as a signature from the metal-poor, accreting gas and the metal-rich, outflowing gas, both being traced by sub-{DLAs} at low redshifts.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01906},
	abstract = {Star formation in galaxies is inefficient, and understanding how star formation is regulated in galaxies is one of the most fundamental challenges of contemporary astrophysics. Radiative cooling, feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei, large-scale dynamics and dissipation of turbulent energy act over various time and spatial scales, and all regulate star formation in a complex gas cycle. This paper presents the physics implemented in a new semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution: G.A.S. The fundamental underpinning of our new model is the development of a multi-phase interstellar medium ({ISM}) in which energy produced by supernovae and active galaxy nuclei maintains an equilibrium between the diffuse, hot, stable gas and a cooler, clumpy, low-volume filling factor gas. We include a description of how turbulence leads to the formation of giant molecular clouds through an inertial turbulent energy cascade. We explicitly model the evolution of the velocity dispersion at the different scales of the cascade and also account for thermal instabilities in the hot halo gas. Thermal instabilities effectively reduces the impact of radiative cooling and moderates accretion rates onto galaxies residing in massive halos. We show that rapid and multiple exchanges between gas phases strongly regulates star-formation rates in galaxies because only a small fraction of the unstable gas is forming stars. The characteristic timescales describing the gas cycle, the gas depletion timescale and the star-forming laws are in good agreement with observations. Our results are also in good agreement with the observed stellar mass function. Our model allows us to test the importance of turbulence in regulating the structure of the {ISM} in galaxies, in making star formation less efficient, and in keeping galaxy growth overall inefficient in the early Universe.},

	doi = {10.1093/mnras/stz060},
	abstract = {We investigate the interactions of energetic hadronic particles with the media in outflows from star-forming protogalaxies. These particles undergo pion-producing interactions which can drive a heating effect in the outflow, while those advected by the outflow also transport energy beyond the galaxy, heating the circumgalactic medium. We investigate how this process evolves over the length of the outflow and calculate the corresponding heating rates in advection-dominated and diffusion-dominated cosmic ray transport regimes. In a purely diffusive transport scenario, we find the peak heating rate reaches \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-26\}{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}! \{{\textbackslash}rm erg{\textasciitilde}cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}! \{{\textbackslash}rm s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at the base of the outflow where the wind is driven by core-collapse supernovae at an event rate of 0.1 \${\textbackslash}text\{yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, but does not extend beyond 2 kpc. In the advection limit, the peak heating rate is reduced to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-28\}{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}! \{{\textbackslash}rm erg{\textasciitilde}cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}! \{{\textbackslash}rm s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, but its extent can reach to tens of kpc. Around 10{\textbackslash}\% of the cosmic rays injected into the system can escape by advection with the outflow wind, while the remaining cosmic rays deliver an important interstellar heating effect. We apply our cosmic ray heating model to the recent observation of the high-redshift galaxy {MACS}1149-{JD}1 and show that it could account for the quenching of a previous starburst inferred from spectroscopic observations. Re-ignition of later star-formation may be caused by the presence of filamentary circumgalactic inflows which are reinstated after cosmic ray heating has subsided.},

	abstract = {Accurate models of radiative cooling are a fundamental ingredient of modern cosmological simulations. Without cooling, accreted baryons will not efficiently dissipate their energy and collapse to the centres of haloes to form stars. It is well established that local variations in the amplitude and shape of the spectral energy distribution of the radiation field can drastically alter the cooling rate. Here we introduce {deepCool}, {deepHeat}, and {deepMetal}: methods for accurately modelling the total cooling rates, total heating rates, and metal-line only cooling rates of irradiated gas using artificial neural networks. We train our algorithm on a high-resolution cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation and demonstrate that we can predict the cooling rate, as measured with the photoionisation code {CLOUDY}, under the influence of a local radiation field, to an accuracy of {\textasciitilde}5\%. Our method is computationally and memory efficient, making it suitable for deployment in state-of-the-art radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We show that the circumgalactic medium and diffuse gas surrounding the central regions of a galaxy are most affected by the interplay of radiation and gas, and that standard cooling functions that ignore the local radiation field can incorrectly predict the cooling rate by more than an order of magnitude, indicating that the baryon cycle in galaxies is affected by the influence of a local radiation field on the cooling rate.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01192},
	abstract = {One of the key questions in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies is how starbursts affect the assembly of stellar populations in galaxies over time. We define a burst indicator (\${\textbackslash}eta\$), which compares a galaxy's star formation rates on short (\${\textbackslash}sim10\$ Myr) and long (\${\textbackslash}sim100\$ Myr) timescales. To estimate \${\textbackslash}eta\$, we apply the detailed temporal luminosity response of H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and near-ultraviolet emission to simulated star formation histories ({SFHs}) from Semi-Analytic Models and the Mufasa hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. We find that the average value of \${\textbackslash}eta\$ is not itself a good indicator of star formation stochasticity (burstiness); indeed we show that this average should be close to zero unless the population being studied has an average {SFH} which is rising or falling rapidly. Instead, analyzing the width of the distribution of \${\textbackslash}eta\$ for ensembles of galaxies allows us to characterize the level of burstiness in a galaxy population's recent star formation history. We find this width to be robust to variations in stellar initial mass function ({IMF}) and metallicity. We apply realistic noise and selection effects to the models to generate mock {HST} and {JWST} galaxy catalogs and compare these catalogs with 3D-{HST} observations of 956 galaxies at \$0.65{\textless}z{\textless}1.5\$ detected in H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$. Measurements of \${\textbackslash}eta\$ are unaffected by dust measurement errors under the assumption that \$E(B-V)\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{stars\}=0.44{\textbackslash},E(B-V)\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{gas\}\$ (i.e., \$Q\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{sg\}=0.44\$). However, setting \$Q\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{sg\}=0.8{\textasciicircum}\{+0.1\}\_\{-0.2\}\$ removes an unexpected dependence of the average value of \${\textbackslash}eta\$ upon dust attenuation and stellar mass in the 3D-{HST} sample while also resolving disagreements in the distribution of star formation rates. However, even varying the dust law cannot resolve all discrepancies between the simulated and the observed galaxies.},

	abstract = {Galactic gas outflows are driven by stellar feedback with dominant contribution from supernovae ({SN}) explosions. The question of whether the energy deposited by {SNe} initiates a large scale outflow or gas circulation on smaller scales -- between discs and intermediate haloes, depends on {SN} rate and their distribution in space and time. We consider here gas circulation by disc-wide unclustered {SNe} with galactic star formation rate in the range from \{\${\textbackslash}simeq 6{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ to \${\textbackslash}simeq 6{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\${\textasciitilde}yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\${\textasciitilde}kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, corresponding to mid-to-high star formation observed in galaxies. We show that such disc-wide {SN} explosion regime can form circulation of warm (\$T{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ K) and cold (\$T{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}3\$ K) phases within a few gas scale heights, and elevation of hot \{(\$T{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}5\$ K)\} gas at higher (\$z{\textgreater}1\$ kpc) heights. We found that the threshold energy input rate for hot gas outflows with disc-wide supernovae explosions is estimated to be of the order \${\textbackslash}sim 4{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\${\textasciitilde}erg{\textasciitilde}s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\${\textasciitilde}cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$.

	abstract = {A method to diagnose the gas distribution in the Galactic halo using a shock wave from the Galactic Centre ({GC}) is presented. Propagation of a shock wave caused by central explosion with released energy \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{55\}\$ erg is calculated for various models of the gaseous halo, and the shock front morphology is compared with the observed North- ({NPS}) and South-Polar Spurs ({SPS}). The observed bipolar hyper-shell ({BHS}) structure of the spurs is reproduced, when a semi-exponential halo model with radially-variable scale height is adopted. A spherical halo model (\${\textbackslash}beta\$ model) is shown to be not appropriate to explain the observed {BHS} shape. Asymmetry of the spurs with respect to the rotation axis and to the galactic plane is explained by large-scale density gradient in the halo across the Galaxy. Such gradient may be produced by ram pressure of the {IGM} during motion of the Galaxy in the Local Group. A halo model having sinusoidal density fluctuations (clouds) can also explain the asymmetry, given appropriate cloud parameters are chosen. Further irregular features such as filaments and multiple curvatures superposed on the spurs are also understood as due to density fluctuations in the halo.},

	abstract = {We propose the Cosmic Web Detachment ({CWD}) model, a framework to interpret the star-formation history of galaxies in a cosmological context. The {CWD} model unifies several starvation mechanisms known to disrupt or stop star formation into one single physical framework. Galaxies begin accreting star-forming gas at early times via a network of primordial filaments, simply related to the pattern of density fluctuations in the initial conditions. But when streams cross on intergalactic scales, this pattern is disrupted, and the galaxy {\textbackslash}textit\{detaches\} from its primordial filaments, ending the accretion of cold gas. We argue that {CWD} encompasses known external processes halting star formation, such as harassment, strangulation and starvation. On top of these external processes, internal feedback processes such as {AGN} contribute to stop in star formation as well. We introduce a simple formalism to identify {CWD} events and quenched galaxies in dark-matter \$N\$-body simulations. With it we reproduce and explain, in the context of {CWD}, several observations including downsizing, the cosmic star formation rate history, the galaxy mass-color diagram and the dependence of the fraction of red galaxies with mass and local density.},

The shape of the {MZ} relations is very similar between the different calibrators, while there are large offsets in the absolute values of the abundances. We confirm our previous results derived using the spatially resolved data provided by the {CALIFA} and {MaNGA} surveys: (1) we do not find any significant secondary relation of the {MZR} with either the star formation rate ({SFR}) nor the specific {SFR} ({SFR}/Mass) for any of the calibrators used in this study, based on the analysis of the \{individual\} residuals, (2) if there is a dependence with the {SFR}, it is weaker than the reported one (\$r\_c{\textbackslash}sim -\$0.3), it is confined to the low mass regime (M*{\textless}10\${\textasciicircum}9\$Msun) or high {SFR} regimes, and it does not produce any significant improvement in the \{description of the average population of galaxies.

While adiabatic losses can be significant, they occur only after {CRs} escape galaxies, so they are only of secondary importance for γ-ray emissivities. Models where {CRs} are ‘trapped’ in the star-forming disc have lower star formation efficiency, but these models are ruled out by γ-ray observations.

	abstract = {Dwarf galaxies in the Local Group ({LG}) represent a distinct as well as diverse family of tracers of the earliest phases of galaxy assembly and the processing resulting from galactic harassment. Their stellar populations can be resolved and used as probes of the evolution of their host galaxy. In this regard, we present the first reconstruction of the star formation history ({SFH}) of them using the most evolved {AGB} stars that are long period variable ({LPV}). For the nearby, relatively massive and interacting gas-rich dwarf galaxies, the Magellanic Clouds, we found that the bulk of the stars formed {\textasciitilde} 10 Gyr ago for the {LMC}, while the strongest episode of star formation in the {SMC} occurred a few Gyr later. A peak in star formation around 0.7 Gyr ago in both Clouds is likely linked to their recent interaction. The Andromeda satellite pair {NGC}147/185 show different histories; the main epoch of star formation for {NGC} 185 occurred 8.3 Gyr ago, followed by a much lower, but relatively constant star formation rate ({SFR}). In the case of {NGC} 147, the {SFR} peaked only 6.9 Gyr ago, staying intense until {\textasciitilde} 3 Gyr ago. Star formation in the isolated gas-rich dwarf galaxy {IC} 1613 has proceeded at a steady rate over the past 5 Gyr, without any particular dominant epoch. Due to lack of sufficient data, we have conducted an optical monitoring survey at the Isaac Newton Telescope ({INT}) of 55 dwarf galaxies in the {LG} to reconstruct the {SFH} of them uniformly. The observations are made over ten epochs, spaced approximately three months apart, as the luminosity of {LPV} stars varies on timescales of months to years. The system of galactic satellites of the large Andromeda spiral galaxy (M31) forms one of the key targets of our monitoring survey. We present the first results in the And I dwarf galaxy, where we discovered 116 {LPVs} among over 10,000 stars.},

	abstract = {This article introduces the Intergalactic Medium Visualization, or '{IGM}-Vis', a novel visualization and data analysis platform for investigating galaxies and the gas that surrounds them in context with their larger scale environment, the Cosmic Web. Environment is an important factor in the evolution of galaxies from actively forming stars to quiescent states with little, if any, discernible star formation activity. The gaseous halos of galaxies (the circumgalactic medium, or {CGM}) play a critical role in their evolution, because the gas necessary to fuel star formation and any gas expelled from widely observed galactic winds must encounter this interface region between galaxies and the intergalactic medium ({IGM}). We present a taxonomy of tasks typically employed in {IGM}/{CGM} studies informed by a survey of astrophysicists at various career levels, and demonstrate how these tasks are facilitated via the use of our visualization software. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of {IGM}-Vis through two in-depth use cases that depict real-world analysis sessions that use {IGM}/{CGM} data.},

In this work, we investigate the possibilities to utilize the observed clustered nature of star formation ({SF}) in order to refine {SF} prescriptions and constrain the density threshold parameter. To this end, we measure the clustering strength, correlation length and power-law index of the two-point correlation function of young (\${\textbackslash}tau{\textless}50\$ Myr) stellar particles and compare our results to observations from the {HST} Legacy Extragalactic {UV} Survey ({LEGUS}). Our simulations reveal a clear trend of larger clustering signal and power-law index and lower correlation length as the {SF} threshold increases with only mild dependence on galaxy properties such as stellar mass or specific star formation rate. In conclusion, we find that the observed clustering of {SF} is inconsistent with a low threshold for {SF} (\$n{\textless}1\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$) and strongly favours a high value for the density threshold of {SF} (\$n{\textgreater}10\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$), as for example employed in the {NIHAO} project.},

	abstract = {Leo P is a gas-rich dwarf galaxy with an extremely low gas-phase oxygen abundance (3\% solar). The isolated nature of Leo P enables a quantitative measurement of metals lost solely due to star formation feedback. We present an inventory of the oxygen atoms in Leo P based on the gas-phase oxygen abundance measurement, the star formation history, and the chemical enrichment evolution derived from resolved stellar populations. The star formation history also provides the total amount of oxygen produced. Overall, Leo P has retained 5 \% of its oxygen; 25\% of the retained oxygen is in the stars while 75\% is in the gas phase. This is considerably lower than the 20-25\% calculated for massive galaxies, supporting the trend for less efficient metal retention for lower mass galaxies. The retention fraction is higher than that calculated for other alpha elements (Mg, Si, Ca) in {dSph} Milky Way satellites of similar stellar mass and metallicity. Accounting only for the oxygen retained in stars, our results are consistent with those derived for the alpha elements in {dSph} galaxies. Thus, under the assumption that the {dSph} galaxies lost the bulk of their gas mass through an environmental process such as tidal stripping, the estimates of retained metal fractions represent underestimates by roughly a factor of four. Because of its isolation, Leo P provides an important datum for the fraction of metals lost as a function of galaxy mass due to star formation.},

	abstract = {It is commonly believed that galaxies use, throughout the Hubble time, a very small fraction of the baryons associated to their dark matter halos to form stars. This so-called low "star formation efficiency" \$f\_{\textbackslash}star{\textbackslash}equiv M\_{\textbackslash}star/f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}\$, where \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\}{\textbackslash}equiv{\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\}/{\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm c\}\$ is the cosmological baryon fraction, is expected to reach its peak at nearly \$L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast\$ (at efficiency \${\textbackslash}approx 20{\textbackslash}\%\$) and decline steeply at lower and higher masses. We have tested this using a sample of nearby star-forming galaxies, from dwarfs (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star{\textbackslash}simeq 10{\textasciicircum}7 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) to high-mass spirals (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star{\textbackslash}simeq 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) with {HI} rotation curves and 3.6\${\textbackslash}mu\$m photometry. We fit the observed rotation curves with a Bayesian approach by varying three parameters, stellar mass-to-light ratio \${\textbackslash}Upsilon\_{\textbackslash}star\$, halo concentration \$c\$ and mass \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}\$. We found two surprising results: 1) the star formation efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of \$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$ with no sign of a decline at high masses, and 2) the most massive spirals (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star{\textbackslash}simeq 1-3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) have \$f\_{\textbackslash}star{\textbackslash}approx 0.3-1\$, i.e. they have turned nearly all the baryons associated to their haloes into stars. These results imply that the most efficient galaxies at forming stars are massive spirals (not \$L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast\$ galaxies), they reach nearly 100\% efficiency and thus, once their gas is also considered, they have virtually no missing baryons. Moreover, there is no evidence of mass quenching of the star formation occurring in galaxies up to halo masses of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}{\textbackslash}approx \{{\textbackslash}rm a{\textbackslash}, few\}{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$.},

Such a low metallicity raises the question of {LLS}1723's origin and enrichment history. Previous simulations of the circumgalactic medium imply that {LLS}1723 is a natural candidate for a cold gas stream accreting towards a galaxy. Alternatively, {LLS}1723 may represent a high-density portion of the intergalactic medium containing either pristine gas -- unpolluted by stellar debris for 1.4 Gyr after the Big Bang -- or the remnants of low-energy supernovae from (likely low-mass) Population {III} stars. Evidence for the circumgalactic scenario could be obtained by mapping the environment around {LLS}1723 with optical integral-field spectroscopy. The intergalactic possibilities highlight the need for -- and opportunity to test -- simulations of the frequency with which such high-density, very low-metallicity systems arise in the intergalactic medium.},

I review the diverse portfolio of direct observations of stellar {GWs} since 2010. Maturing measurements of the ionized and neutral gas properties of nearby winds have been joined by exciting new probes of molecular gas and dust. Low-\$z\$ techniques have been newly applied in large numbers at high \$z\$. The explosion of optical and near-infrared 3D imaging spectroscopy has revealed the complex, multiphase structure of nearby {GWs}. These observations point to stellar {GWs} being a common feature of rapidly star-forming galaxies throughout at least the second half of cosmic history, and suggest that scaling relationships between outflow and galaxy properties persist over this period. The simple model of a modest-velocity, biconical flow of multiphase gas and dust perpendicular to galaxy disks continues to be a robust descriptor of these flows.},

	abstract = {The quenching `maintenance' and `cooling flow' problems are important from the Milky Way through massive cluster elliptical galaxies. Previous work has shown that some source of energy beyond that from stars and pure magnetohydrodynamic processes is required, perhaps from {AGN}, but even the qualitative form of this energetic input remains uncertain. Different scenarios include thermal `heating,' direct wind or momentum injection, cosmic ray heating or pressure support, or turbulent `stirring' of the intra-cluster medium ({ICM}). We investigate these in \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ halos using high-resolution non-cosmological simulations with the {FIRE}-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) stellar feedback model, including simplified toy energy-injection models, where we arbitrarily vary the strength, injection scale, and physical form of the energy. We explore which scenarios can quench without violating observational constraints on energetics or {ICM} gas. We show that turbulent stirring in the central \${\textbackslash}sim100{\textbackslash},\$kpc, or cosmic-ray injection, can both maintain a stable low-{SFR} halo for \${\textgreater}\$Gyr timescales with modest energy input, by providing a non-thermal pressure which stably lowers the core density and cooling rates. In both cases, associated thermal-heating processes are negligible. Turbulent stirring preserves cool-core features while mixing condensed core gas into the hotter halo and is by far the most energy efficient model. Pure thermal heating or nuclear isotropic momentum injection require vastly larger energy, are less efficient in lower-mass halos, easily over-heat cores, and require fine-tuning to avoid driving unphysical temperature gradients or gas expulsion from the halo center.},

We find anomalously low metallicity ({ALM}) gas in 10\% of the star-forming spaxels, and in 25\% of the galaxies in the sample. The incidence rate of {ALM} gas increases strongly with both global and local measures of the specific star-formation rate, and is higher in lower mass galaxies and in the outer regions of galaxies. The incidence rate is also significantly higher in morphologically disturbed galaxies. We estimate that the lifetimes of the {ALM} regions are a few hundred Myr. We argue that the {ALM} gas has been delivered to its present location by a combination of interactions, mergers, and accretion from the halo, and that this infusion of gas stimulates star-formation. Given the estimated lifetime and duty cycle of such events, we estimate that the time-averaged accretion rate of {ALM} gas is similar to the star-formation rate in late type galaxies over the mass-range M\$\_* {\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}9\$ to 10\${\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$.},

We find that \$1.8{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}9 {\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ of metals, or 62\% of the metal mass formed within \$r {\textless} 19 {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$, is missing from the disk in our fiducial model, implying that the M31 disk has experienced significant gaseous outflows over its lifetime. This fiducial missing metal mass is over a factor of 100 larger than the observational estimate of the metal content of M31's circumgalactic medium ({CGM}). If all of this missing metal mass resides in M31's {CGM}, we show that either the hydrogen mass in the {CGM} must exceed the stellar mass in M31, or the {CGM} must have super-solar metallicity. We find that no net metal loss is required in the past 1.5 Gyr, but some metal mass produced since then in the central \${\textbackslash}sim5 {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$ has likely been redistributed farther out in the disk.},

	abstract = {In recent years, observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich ({SZ}) effect have had significant cosmological implications and have begun to serve as a powerful and independent probe of the warm and hot gas that pervades the Universe. As a few pioneering studies have already shown, {SZ} observations both complement X-ray observations -- the traditional tool for studying the intra-cluster medium -- and bring unique capabilities for probing astrophysical processes at high redshifts and out to the low-density regions in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Advances in {SZ} observations have largely been driven by developments in centimetre-, millimetre-, and submillimetre-wave instrumentation on ground-based facilities, with notable exceptions including results from the Planck satellite. Here we review the utility of the thermal, kinematic, relativistic, non-thermal, and polarised {SZ} effects for studies of galaxy clusters and other large scale structures, incorporating the many advances over the past two decades that have impacted {SZ} theory, simulations, and observations. We also discuss observational results, techniques, and challenges, and aim to give an overview and perspective on emerging opportunities, with the goal of highlighting some of the exciting new directions in this field.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02025},
	abstract = {It has long been recognized that tight relations link the mass, size, and characteristic velocity of galaxies. These scaling laws reflect the way in which baryons populate, cool, and settle at the center of their host dark matter halos; the angular momentum they retain in the assembly process; as well as the radial distribution and mass scalings of the dark matter halos. There has been steady progress in our understanding of these processes in recent years, mainly as sophisticated N-body and hydrodynamical simulation techniques have enabled the numerical realization of galaxy models of ever increasing complexity, realism, and appeal. These simulations have now clarified the origin of these galaxy scaling laws in a universe dominated by cold dark matter: these relations arise from the tight (but highly non-linear) relations between (i) galaxy mass and halo mass, (ii) galaxy size and halo characteristic radius; and (iii) from the self-similar mass nature of cold dark matter halo mass profiles. The excellent agreement between simulated and observed galaxy scaling laws is a resounding success for the {LCDM} cosmogony on the highly non-linear scales of individual galaxies.},

We propose and implement a novel, super-Lagrangian '{CGM} zoom' scheme in the moving-mesh code {AREPO}, which focuses more resolution into the {CGM} and intentionally lowers resolution in the dense {ISM}. We run two cosmological simulations of the same galaxy halo, once with a simple 'no feedback' model, and separately with a more comprehensive physical model including galactic-scale outflows as in the Illustris simulation. Our chosen halo has a total mass of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun at z {\textasciitilde} 2, and we achieve a median gas mass (spatial) resolution of {\textasciitilde}2,200 solar masses ({\textasciitilde}95 parsecs) in the {CGM}, six-hundred (fourteen) times better than in the Illustris-1 simulation, a higher spatial resolution than any cosmological simulation at this mass scale to date. We explore the primary channel(s) of cold-phase {CGM} gas production in this regime. We find that winds substantially enhance the amount of cold gas in the halo, also evidenced in the covering fractions of {HI} and the equivalent widths of {MgII} out to large radii, in better agreement with observations than the case without galactic winds. Using a tracer particle analysis to follow the thermodynamic history of gas, we demonstrate how the majority of this cold, dense gas arises due to rapid cooling of the wind material interacting with the hot halo, and how large amounts of cold, {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}4 K gas can be produced and persist in galactic halos with Tvir {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}6 K. At the resolutions presently considered, the quantitative properties of the {CGM} we explore are not appreciably affected by the refinement scheme.},

Our sample is split into two azimuthal angle bins: major axis (\${\textbackslash}Phi{\textless}25{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$) and minor axis (\${\textbackslash}Phi{\textgreater}33{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$). {OVI} absorption along the galaxy major axis is not correlated with galaxy rotation kinematics, with only 1/10 systems that could be explained with rotation/accretion models. This is in contrast to co-rotation commonly observed for {MgII} absorption. {OVI} along the minor axis could be modeled by accelerating outflows but only for small opening angles, while the majority of the {OVI} is decelerating. Along both axes, stacked {OVI} profiles reside at the galaxy systemic velocity with the absorption kinematics spanning the entire dynamical range of their galaxies. The {OVI} found in {AMR} cosmological simulations exists within filaments and in halos of {\textasciitilde}50 kpc surrounding galaxies. Simulations show that major axis {OVI} gas inflows along filaments and decelerates as it approaches the galaxy while increasing in its level of co-rotation. Minor axis outflows in the simulations are effective within 50-75 kpc beyond that they decelerate and fall back onto the galaxy. Although the simulations show clear {OVI} kinematic signatures they are not directly comparable to observations. When we compare kinematic signatures integrated through the entire simulated galaxy halo we find that these signatures are washed out due to full velocity distribution of {OVI} throughout the halo. We conclude that {OVI} alone does not serve as a useful kinematic indicator of gas accretion, outflows or star-formation and likely best probes the halo virial temperature.},

The metallicity {PDF} of the {LLSs} might be more complicated than an unimodal or bimodal distribution. The {pLLSs} and {LLSs} probe a similar range of metallicities -3{\textless}[X/H]{\textless}+0.4, but the fraction of very metal-poor absorbers with [X/H]{\textless}-1.4 is much larger for the {pLLSs} than the {LLSs}.

	abstract = {Throughout the Hubble time, gas makes its way from the intergalactic medium into galaxies fuelling their star formation and promoting their growth. One of the key properties of the accreting gas is its angular momentum, which has profound implications for the evolution of, in particular, disc galaxies. Here, we discuss how to infer the angular momentum of the accreting gas using observations of present-day galaxy discs. We first summarize evidence for ongoing inside-out growth of star forming discs. We then focus on the chemistry of the discs and show how the observed metallicity gradients can be explained if gas accretes onto a disc rotating with a velocity 20-30\% lower than the local circular speed. We also show that these gradients are incompatible with accretion occurring at the edge of the discs and flowing radially inward. Finally, we investigate gas accretion from a hot corona with a cosmological angular momentum distribution and describe how simple models of rotating coronae guarantee the inside-out growth of disc galaxies.},

	abstract = {A small survey of the {UV}-absorbing gas in 12 low-\$z\$ galaxy groups has been conducted using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph ({COS}) on-board the Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}). Targets were selected from a large, homogeneously-selected sample of groups found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS}). A critical selection criterion excluded sight lines that pass close (\${\textless}1.5\$ virial radii) to a group galaxy, to ensure absorber association with the group as a whole. Deeper galaxy redshift observations are used both to search for closer galaxies and also to characterize these \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13.5\}\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{14.5\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ groups, the most massive of which are highly-virialized with numerous early-type galaxies ({ETGs}). This sample also includes two spiral-rich groups, not yet fully-virialized. At group-centric impact parameters of 0.3-2 Mpc, these \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{S/N\}=15\$-30 spectra detected {HI} absorption in 7 of 12 groups; high ({OVI}) and low ({SiIII}) ion metal lines are present in 2/3 of the absorption components. None of the three most highly-virialized, {ETG}-dominated groups are detected in absorption. Covering fractions \${\textbackslash}gtrsim50\$\% are seen at all impact parameters probed, but do not require large filling factors despite an enormous extent. Unlike halo clouds in individual galaxies, group absorbers have radial velocities which are too low to escape the group potential well without doubt. This suggests that these groups are "closed boxes" for galactic evolution in the current epoch. Evidence is presented that the cool and warm group absorbers are not a pervasive intra-group medium ({IGrM}), requiring a hotter (\$T{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}6\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}7\$ K) {IGrM} to be present to close the baryon accounting.},

Using {UV} spectroscopy of {QSO} sightlines projected within 500 kpc (\${\textbackslash}sim R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$) of these galaxies, we detect {HI} absorption in 11/21 sightlines, including two partial Lyman limit systems and two Lyman limit systems. The covering factor of \${\textbackslash}log N({HI}) {\textbackslash}ge 16.0\$ gas within the virial radius of these {LRGs} is \$f\_c({\textbackslash}rho {\textbackslash}le R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}) = 0.27{\textasciicircum}\{+0.11\}\_\{-0.10\}\$, while for optically-thick gas (\${\textbackslash}log N({HI}) {\textbackslash}ge 17.2\$) it is \$f\_c({\textbackslash}rho {\textbackslash}le R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}) = 0.15{\textasciicircum}\{+0.10\}\_\{-0.07\}\$. Combining this sample of massive galaxies with previous galaxy-selected {CGM} studies, we find no strong dependence of the {HI} covering factor on galaxy mass, although star-forming galaxies show marginally higher covering factors. There is no evidence for a critical mass above which dense, cold (\$T {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ K) gas is suppressed in the {CGM} of galaxies (spanning stellar masses \$9.5 {\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash}log M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}lesssim 11.8\$).

We aimed to detect hot gas bubbles that would indicate the existence of powerful, galaxy-scale outflows in our targets, {HE} 0227-0931 and {HE} 0351+0240, from deep (200 ks) Chandra observations. Methods: By measuring the spatial and spectral properties of the extended X-ray emission and comparing with the sub kpc-scale {IFU} data, we are able to constrain feedback scenarios and directly test if the ionized gas is due to a shocked wind. Results: No extended hot gas emission on kpc-scales was detected. Unless the ambient medium density is low (\$n\_\{H\}{\textbackslash}sim{\textasciitilde}1\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ at 100 pc), the inferred upper limits on the extended X-ray luminosities are well below what is expected from theoretical models at matching {AGN} luminosities. Conclusions: We conclude that the highly-ionized gas structures on kpc scales are not inflated by a hot outflow in either target, and instead are likely caused by photo-ionization of pre-existing gas streams of different origins. Our non-detections suggest that extended X-ray emission from an {AGN}-driven wind is not universal, and may lead to conflicts with current theoretical predictions.},

	abstract = {Ubiquitous detections of cold/warm gas around galaxies indicate that the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) is multiphase and dynamic. Recent state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy simulations have generally underproduced the column density of cold halo gas. We argue that this may be due to a mismatch of spatial resolution in the circumgalactic space and the relevant physical scales at which the cold gas operates. Using semi-analytic calculations and a set of magnetohydrodynamic ({MHD}) simulations, we present a multiphase model of the gaseous halos around galaxies, the circumgalactic mist ({CGm}). The {CGm} model is based on the idea that the observed cold halo gas may be a composite of cold, dense and small cloudlets embedded in a hot diffuse halo, resembling terrestrial clouds and mist. We show that the resulting cold gas from thermal instabilities conforms to a characteristic column density of \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm H\}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{17\}{\textbackslash}rm\{cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\}\$ as predicted by the \$c\_s t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}\$ ansatz. The model implies a large number of cold clumps in the inner galactic halo with a small volume filling factor but large covering fraction. The model also naturally gives rise to spatial extents and differential covering fractions of cold, warm and hot gas. To self-consistently model the co-evolution of the {CGM} and star formation within galaxies, future simulations must address the mismatch of the spatial resolution and characteristic scale of cold gas.},

We present a new scale-free shape-independent algorithm to robustly and accurately identify galaxies in simulation, implemented within the phase-space halo-finder code {VELOCIraptor}. This is achieved by using the full phase-space dispersion tensor for particle assignment and an iterative adjustment of search parameters, which help us overcome common structure finding problems. We apply our improved method to the Horizon-{AGN} simulation and compare galaxy stellar masses (\$M\_*\$), star formation rates ({SFR}) and sizes with the elaborate configuration-space halo finder, {HaloMaker}. Galaxies living in halos with \${\textgreater} 1\$ galaxy are the most affected by the shortcomings of real-space finders, with their mass, {SFR}, and sizes being \${\textgreater} 2\$ times larger (smaller) in the case of host (satellite) galaxies. Thus, our ability to measure minor/major merger rates and disentangle environmental effects in simulations can be generally hindered if the identification of galaxies is not treated carefully. Though large systematic differences are obtained on a one-to-one basis, the overall Galaxy Stellar Mass Function, the Star Formation Rate Function and mass-size relations are not greatly affected.

Moreover, in agreement with recent {MUSE} observations, we detected a {\textasciitilde}90 kpc Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} nebula at the quasar redshift and three Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} emitters reminiscent of a "dark galaxy" population.},

	abstract = {Radiative feedback ({RFB}) from stars plays a key role in galaxies, but remains poorly-understood. We explore this using high-resolution, multi-frequency radiation-hydrodynamics ({RHD}) simulations from the Feedback In Realistic Environments ({FIRE}) project. We study dwarf through Milky Way masses, and explore {RHD} effects including H/He photoionization; photoelectric, Lyman Werner, Compton, thermal dust heating; single and multiple-scattering radiation pressure ({RP}). We also compare fundamentally distinct {RHD} algorithms: the ray-based {LEBRON} (exact when optically-thin) and moments-based M1 (exact when optically-thick). In all cases, the dominant {RFB} channels on galaxy scales are photoionization heating and single-scattering {RP}. At all masses, most of the ionizing/{FUV} luminosity from young stars ({\textasciitilde}half bolometric) is absorbed. In dwarfs, the strongest effect is photoionization heating from the meta-galactic background, suppressing accretion onto galaxies. At {MW}-mass the meta-galactic background has negligible effects; but local photoionization and single-scattering {RP} both contribute significantly to regulating the galactic star formation efficiency and lowering central densities. Without some {RFB} (or other 'rapid' {FB}), resolved {GMCs} turn most of their mass into stars, making galaxies dominated by hyper-dense, bound clusters. This makes star formation more violent and 'bursty' when {SNe} explode in hyper-clustered objects: thus, including {RFB} tends to 'smooth out' star formation. {IR} multiple-scattering is rare: the majority of photon absorption occurs in 'normal' {GMCs} with \$A\_\{V\}{\textbackslash}sim1\$. These conclusions are robust to the {RHD} method, but M1 produces somewhat stronger {RFB} effects.},

	abstract = {Traditional cosmological hydrodynamics simulations fail to spatially resolve the circumgalatic medium ({CGM}), the reservoir of tenuous gas surrounding a galaxy and extending to its virial radius. We introduce the technique of Enhanced Halo Resolution ({EHR}), enabling more realistic physical modeling of the simulated {CGM} by consistently forcing gas refinement to smaller scales throughout the virial halo of a simulated galaxy. We investigate the effects of {EHR} in the Tempest simulations, a suite of Enzo-based cosmological zoom simulations following the evolution of an L* galaxy, resolving spatial scales of 500 comoving pc out to 100 comoving kpc in galactocentric radius. Among its many effects, {EHR} (1) changes the thermal balance of the {CGM}, increasing its cool gas content and decreasing its warm/hot gas content; (2) preserves cool gas structures for longer periods; and (3) enables these cool clouds to exist at progressively smaller size scales. Observationally, this results in a boost in "low ions" like H I and a drop in "high ions" like O {VI} throughout the {CGM}. These effects of {EHR} do not converge in the Tempest simulations, but extrapolating these trends suggests that the {CGM} in reality is a mist consisting of ubiquitous, small, long-lived, cool clouds suspended in a hot medium at the virial temperature of the halo. Additionally, we explore the physical mechanisms to explain why {EHR} produces the above effects, proposing that it works both by (1) better sampling the distribution of {CGM} phases enabling runaway cooling in the denser, cooler tail of the phase distribution; and (2) preventing cool gas clouds from artificially mixing with the ambient hot halo and evaporating. Evidence is found for both {EHR} mechanisms occurring in the Tempest simulations.},

We calculate the probability distribution of {DM}(z) in different models for how the cosmic baryons are distributed (both analytically and with cosmological simulations). We show that the distribution of {DM} is quite sensitive to whether the "missing" baryons lie around the virial radius of 10{\textasciicircum}11-10{\textasciicircum}13 Msun halos or further out, which is not easily constrained with other observational techniques. The intrinsic contribution to {DM} from each source could complicate studies of the extragalactic contribution. This difficulty is avoided by stacking based on the impact parameter to foreground galaxies. We show that a stacking analysis using a sample of {\textasciitilde}100 {DM} measurements from arcminute-localized, z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 0.5 sources would place interesting constraints at 0.2-2 halo virial radii on the baryonic mass profile surrounding different galaxy types. Conveniently for intergalactic studies, sightlines that intersect intervening galactic disks should be easily identified owing to scattering. A detectable level of scattering may also result from turbulence in the circumgalactic medium.},

	abstract = {We use a particle tracking analysis to study the origins of the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}), separating it into (1) accretion from the intergalactic medium ({IGM}), (2) wind from the central galaxy, and (3) gas ejected from other galaxies. Our sample consists of 21 {FIRE}-2 simulations, spanning the halo mass range Mh ∼ 1010–1012 M⊙, and we focus on z = 0.25 and z = 2. Owing to strong stellar feedback, only ∼L⋆ haloes retain a baryon mass \${\textbackslash}gtrsim{\textbackslash}! 50{\textbackslash}hbox\{ per cent\}\$ of their cosmic budget. Metals are more efficiently retained by haloes, with a retention fraction \${\textbackslash}gtrsim{\textbackslash}! 50{\textbackslash}hbox\{ per cent\}\$. Across all masses and redshifts analysed \${\textbackslash}gtrsim {\textbackslash}!60{\textbackslash}hbox\{ per cent\}\$ of the {CGM} mass originates as {IGM} accretion (some of which is associated with infalling haloes). Overall, the second most important contribution is wind from the central galaxy, though gas ejected or stripped from satellites can contribute a comparable mass in ∼L⋆ haloes. Gas can persist in the {CGM} for billions of years, resulting in well mixed-halo gas. Sightlines through the {CGM} are therefore likely to intersect gas of multiple origins. For low-redshift ∼L⋆ haloes, cool gas (T {\textless} 104.7 K) is distributed on average preferentially along the galaxy plane, however with strong halo-to-halo variability. The metallicity of {IGM} accretion is systematically lower than the metallicity of winds (typically by ≳1 dex), although {CGM} and {IGM} metallicities depend significantly on the treatment of subgrid metal diffusion. Our results highlight the multiple physical mechanisms that contribute to the {CGM} and will inform observational efforts to develop a cohesive picture.},

	title = {Ambient Column Densities of Highly Ionized Oxygen in Precipitation-Limited Circumgalactic Media},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04976},
	abstract = {Many of the baryons associated with a galaxy reside in its circumgalactic medium ({CGM}), in a diffuse volume-filling phase at roughly the virial temperature. Much of the oxygen produced over cosmic time by the galaxy's stars also ends up there. The resulting absorption lines in the spectra of {UV} and X-ray background sources are powerful diagnostics of the feedback processes that prevent more of those baryons from forming stars. This paper presents predictions for {CGM} absorption lines (O {VI}, O {VII}, O {VIII}, Ne {VIII}, N V) that are based on precipitation-regulated feedback models, which posit that the radiative cooling time of the ambient medium cannot drop much below 10 times the freefall time without triggering a strong feedback event. The resulting predictions align with many different observational constraints on the Milky Way's ambient {CGM} and explain why N\_OVI {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}14 cm{\textasciicircum}-2 over large ranges in halo mass and projected radius. Within the precipitation framework, the strongest O{\textasciitilde}{VI} absorption lines result from vertical mixing of the {CGM} that raises low-entropy ambient gas to greater altitudes, because adiabatic cooling of the uplifted gas then lowers its temperature and raises the fractional abundance of O{\textasciicircum}5+. Condensation stimulated by uplift may also produce associated low-ionization components. The observed velocity structure of the O {VI} absorption suggests that galactic outflows do not expel circumgalactic gas at the halo's escape velocity but rather drive circulation that dissipates much of the galaxy's supernova energy within the ambient medium, causing some of it to expand beyond the virial radius.},

Using mock observations of simulated galaxies from the {FIRE} project, we show that one can therefore constrain a galaxy's gas kinematics from its unresolved 21-cm line profile. In particular, we find that the kurtosis of the 21-cm line increases with decreasing \$V/{\textbackslash}sigma\$, and that this trend is robust across a wide range of masses, signal-to-noise ratios, and inclinations. We then quantify the shapes of 21-cm line profiles from a morphologically unbiased sample of \${\textbackslash}sim\$2000 low-redshift, {HI}-detected galaxies with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm star\} = 10{\textasciicircum}\{7-11\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and compare to the simulated galaxies. At \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm star\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, both the observed and simulated galaxies produce double-horned profiles with low kurtosis and steep wings, consistent with rotation-supported disks. Both the observed and simulated line profiles become more Gaussian-like (higher kurtosis and less-steep wings) at lower masses, indicating increased dispersion support. However, the simulated galaxies transition from rotation to dispersion support more strongly: at \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm star\} = 10{\textasciicircum}\{8-10\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, most of the simulations produce more Gaussian-like profiles than typical observed galaxies with similar mass, indicating that gas in the low-mass simulated galaxies is, on average, overly dispersion-supported. Most of the lower-mass simulated galaxies also have somewhat lower gas fractions than the median of the observed population. The simulations nevertheless reproduce the observed line-width baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, which is insensitive to rotation vs. dispersion support.},

In order to constrain the nature of the gas traced by {OVI}, we analyze additional observables of the outer halo, namely {HI} to {OVI} column ratios of 1-10, an absence of low-ion absorption, a mean differential extinction of E(B-V){\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}-3, and a linear relation between {OVI} column and velocity width. We contrast these observations with two physical scenarios: (1) {OVI} traces high-pressure ({\textasciitilde}30 cm{\textasciicircum}-3 K) collisionally-ionized gas cooling from a virially-shocked phase, and (2) {OVI} traces low-pressure ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}1 cm{\textasciicircum}-3 K) gas beyond the accretion shock, where the gas is in ionization and thermal equilibrium with the {UV} background. We demonstrate that the high-pressure scenario requires multiple gas phases to explain the observations, and a large deposition of energy at {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}100 kpc to offset the energy radiated by the cooling gas. In contrast, the low-pressure scenario can explain all considered observations with a single gas phase in thermal equilibrium, provided that the baryon overdensity is comparable to the dark-matter overdensity, and that the gas is enriched to {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}Z\_sun/3 with an {ISM}-like dust-to-metal ratio. The low-pressure scenario implies that {OVI} traces a cool flow with mass flow rate of {\textasciitilde}5 M\_sun yr{\textasciicircum}-1, comparable to the star formation rate of the central galaxies. The {OVI} line widths are consistent with the velocity shear expected within this flow. The low-pressure scenario predicts a bimodality in absorption line ratios at {\textasciitilde}100 kpc, due to the pressure jump across the accretion shock.},

An important source of outflows may be the most numerous galaxies in the Universe: dwarf galaxies. With small gravitational potential wells, these galaxies easily lose their star-forming material in the presence of intense stellar feedback. Here, we show that the nearby dwarf galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud ({SMC}), has atomic hydrogen outflows extending at least 2 kiloparsecs (kpc) from the star-forming bar of the galaxy. The outflows are cold, \$T{\textless}400{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\$, and may have formed during a period of active star formation \$25 - 60\$ million years (Myr) ago. The total mass of atomic gas in the outflow is \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}7\$ solar masses, \$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$, or \${\textbackslash}sim 3\$\% of the total atomic gas of the galaxy.

We suggest that most of the observed outflow will be stripped from the {SMC} through its interaction with its companion, the Large Magellanic Cloud ({LMC}), and the Milky Way, feeding the Magellanic Stream of hydrogen encircling the Milky Way.},

	abstract = {Outflows and rotation are two ubiquitous kinematic features in the gas kinematics of galaxies. Here we introduce a semi-analytic model to quantify how rotating outflows impact the morphology of the Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission line. The model is contrasted against Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations of outflowing gas with additional solid body rotation. We explore a range of neutral Hydrogen optical depth of \$10{\textasciicircum}5 {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}\} {\textbackslash}leq10{\textasciicircum}7\$, rotational velocity \$0 {\textbackslash}leq v\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rot\}\}/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textbackslash} s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}leq 100\$ and outflow velocity \$0{\textbackslash}leq v\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{out\}\}/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textbackslash} s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}leq 50\$. We find three consequences of rotation. First, it introduces a dependency with viewing angle; second it broadens the line and third it increases the flux at the line's center. For all viewing angles, the semi-analytic model reproduces the radiative transfer results for the line width and flux change at the line's center within a \$7{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$50{\textbackslash}\%\$ precision for an optical depth of \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}\}=10{\textasciicircum}5\$, respectively, and within \$2{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$1{\textbackslash}\%\$ for an optical depth of \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}\}=10{\textasciicircum}7\$. Using this model we also show that the peaks of integrated spectra taken from opposite sides of an edge-on rotating gas distribution should have a separation of \${\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}v\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rot\}\}\$. The semi-analytic model presented here is a convenient tool to introduce rotational kinematics as a post-processing step of idealized Monte Carlo simulations; it provides a framework to interpret {\textbackslash}lya spectra in systems where rotation is expected or directly measured through kinematic maps.},

We find that all 17 candidate outflow galaxies lie along the sequence of active star formation in the M\$\_{\textbackslash}star\$ vs. star-formation rate diagram, without a clear excess in the integrated {SFR}. The location of galaxies along the star-formation main sequence ({SFMS}) does not influence strongly the presence or not of outflows. The analysis of the star-formation rate density (\${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$) reveals that the {CALIFA} sources present higher values when compared with normal star-forming galaxies. The strength of this relation depends on the calibrator used to estimate the {SFR}. This excess in \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$ is significant within the first effective radius supporting the idea that most outflows are driven by processes in the inner regions of a galaxy. We find that the molecular gas mass density (\${\textbackslash}Sigma\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{gas\}\$) is a key parameter that plays an important role in the generation of outflows through its association with the local {SFR}.

	abstract = {Large-scale, broad outflows are common in active galaxies. In systems where star formation coexists with an {AGN}, it is unclear yet the role that both play on driving the outflows. In this work we present three-dimensional radiative-cooling {MHD} simulations of the formation of these outflows, considering the feedback from both the {AGN} and supernovae-driven winds. We find that a large-opening-angle {AGN} wind develops fountain structures that make the expanding gas to fall back. Furthermore, it exhausts the gas near the nuclear region, extinguishing star formation and accretion within a few 100.000 yr, which establishes the duty cycle of these outflows. The {AGN} wind accounts for the highest speed features in the outflow with velocities around 10.000 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ (as observed in {UFOs}), but these are not as cold and dense as required by observations of molecular outflows. The {SNe}-driven wind is the main responsible for the observed mass-loading of the outflows.},

We show that stellar feedback (including cosmic rays from {SNe}) alters the balance of cold/warm gas and the rate at which the cooled gas within the galaxy turns into stars, but not the net baryonic inflow. If anything, outflowing metals and dense gas promote additional cooling. Conduction is important only in the most massive halos, as expected, but even at \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ reduces inflow only by a factor \${\textbackslash}sim 2\$ (owing to saturation effects and anisotropic suppression). Changing the morphology of the galaxies only slightly alters their Toomre-\$Q\$ parameter, and has no effect on cooling (as expected), so has essentially no effect on cooling flows or maintaining quenching. This all supports the idea that additional physics, e.g., {AGN} feedback, must be important in massive galaxies.},

Our simulations predict the presence of significant hot gas in the halos as early as \$z=3-4\$, well before the halos ought to be able to sustain hot mode accretion in the conventional picture. The nascent coronae grow inside-out and initially do so primarily as a result of outflows from the central galaxies powered by merger-induced shock heating and strong supernovae feedback, both of which are elemental features of today's successful galaxy formation models. Furthermore, the outflows and the forming coronae also accelerate the transition from cold to hot mode accretion by contributing to the conditions for sustaining stable accretion shocks. They also disrupt the filamentary streams funneling cold gas onto the central galaxies by causing their mouths to fray into a broad delta, detach from the galaxies, and be pushed away to larger radii. And even though at early times the filaments repeatedly re-form, the hot gas and the outflows act to weaken the filaments and accelerate their ultimate disruption. Although galactic outflows are generally thought of as ejective feedback, we find that their action on the filaments suggests a preventive role as well.},

	abstract = {Post-starburst galaxies are typically considered to be a transition population, en route to the red sequence after a recent quenching event. Despite this, recent observations have shown that these objects typically have large reservoirs of cold molecular gas. In this paper we study the star-forming gas properties of a large sample of post-starburst galaxies selected from the cosmological, hydrodynamical {EAGLE} simulations. These objects resemble observed high-mass post-starburst galaxies both spectroscopically and in terms of their space density, stellar mass distribution and sizes. We find that the vast majority of simulated post-starburst galaxies have significant gas reservoirs, with star-forming gas masses of {\textasciitilde}10\${\textasciicircum}9\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, in good agreement with those seen in observational samples. The simulation reproduces the observed time evolution of the gas fraction of the post-starburst galaxy population, with the average galaxy losing {\textasciitilde}90 per cent of its star-forming interstellar medium in only {\textasciitilde}600 Myr. A variety of gas consumption/loss processes are responsible for this rapid evolution, including mergers and environmental effects, while active galactic nuclei play only a secondary role. The fast evolution in the gas fraction of post-starburst galaxies is accompanied by a clear decrease in the efficiency of star formation, due to a decrease in the dense gas fraction. We predict that forthcoming {ALMA} observations of the gas reservoirs of low-redshift post-starburst galaxies will show that the molecular gas is typically compact and has disturbed kinematics, reflecting the disruptive nature of many of the evolutionary pathways that build up the post-starburst galaxy population.},

We characterise the density-temperature distribution of different phases and inspect their metallicity, finding evidence for early metal enrichment in the Intracluster Medium ({ICM}) of clusters already at \$z=4\$. Not only we find that filaments host more star-forming gas than knots, but that filaments also have a higher relative mass fraction of gas in this phase than knots.

Using our Cosmic Web classification, we predict the {WHIM} to be the dominant baryon mass contribution in filaments and knots at redshift \$z=0\$, but not in sheets and voids where the cool, diffuse {IGM} dominates. We also characterise the evolution of {WHIM} and {IGM} from redshift \$z=4\$ to redshift \$z=0\$, and find that the mass fraction of {WHIM} in filaments and knots evolves only by a factor \${\textbackslash}sim 2\$ from redshift \$z=0\$ to \$z=1\$, but declines faster at higher redshift.

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09529},
	abstract = {We found that an intermediate velocity cloud ({IVC}) {IVC} 86-36 in {HI} 21 cm emission shows a head-tail distribution toward the Galactic plane with marked parallel filamentary streamers, which is extended over 40 degrees in the sky. The distance of {IVC} 86-36 is constrained to be less than {\textasciitilde}3 kpc from absorption of a background star as determined from opticalspectroscopy. There is a bridge feature in velocity between the {IVC} and the local {ISM} with velocity separation of {\textasciitilde}50 km s-1, which may indicate dynamical interaction of the {IVC} with the disk. If the interaction is correct, the distance estimate d of the {IVC} ranges from 200 pc to 3 kpc, and the mass of the {IVC} head is estimated to be 7X103(d/1kpc)2Msol. The {IVC} shares similar properties to the Smith cloud located at 12 kpc, including the head-tail distribution, streamers, and bridge feature, while the mass of the {IVC} is less than {\textasciitilde}0.1 of the Smith cloud. A comparison between the Hi and the Planck/{IRAS} dust emission indicates that the dust emission of {IVC} 86-36 is not detectable in spite of its {HI} column density of 2X10{\textasciicircum}20 cm-2, indicating low metalicity of {IVC} 86-36 by a factor of {\textasciitilde}{\textless} 0.2 as compared with the solar neighbor. We conclude that {IVC} 86-38 is an infalling cloud which likely originated in the low-metallicity environment of the Galactic halo or the Magellanic system.},

We present a measurement of the metallicity around {NGC} 891, a nearby, edge-on, Milky Way analog. We find that the hot gas is dominated by low metallicity gas near the virial temperature at \${kT}=0.20{\textbackslash}pm0.01\$ {keV} and \$Z/Z\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} = 0.14{\textbackslash}pm0.03\$(stat)\${\textasciicircum}\{+0.08\}\_\{-0.02\}\$(sys), and that this gas co-exists with hotter (\${kT}=0.71{\textbackslash}pm0.04\$ {keV}) gas that is concentrated near the star-forming regions in the disk. Model choices lead to differences of \${\textbackslash}Delta Z/Z\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textbackslash}sim 0.05\$, and higher \$S/N\$ observations would be limited by systematic error and plasma emission model or abundance ratio choices. The low metallicity gas is consistent with the inner part of an extended halo accreted from the intergalactic medium, which has been modulated by star formation. However, there is much more cold gas than hot gas around {NGC} 891, which is difficult to explain in either the accretion or supernova-driven outflow scenarios. We also find a diffuse nonthermal excess centered on the galactic center and extending to 5 kpc above the disk with a 0.3-10 {keV} \$L\_X = 3.1{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{39\}\$ erg s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$.

We find that the high density gas outflow traced in {HCN}(1-0) and {HCO}+(1-0) emission is co-located with the diffuse molecular outflow emanating from the southern nucleus, where a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus ({AGN}) is believed to be the dominant source of the far-infrared luminosity. On the other hand, the same lines were undetected in the outflow region associated with the northern nucleus, whose primary heating source is likely related to starburst activity without obvious signs of {AGN}. Both {HCO}+(1-0)/{CO}(1-0) line ratio (i.e. dense gas fraction) and the {CO}(3-2)/{CO}(1-0) line ratio are larger in the southern outflow (0.20\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.04 and 1.3\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.2, respectively) than in the southern nucleus (0.08\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.01, 0.7\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.1, respectively). By investigating these line ratios for each velocity component in the southern outflow, we find that the dense gas fraction increases and the {CO}(3-2)/{CO}(1-0) line ratio decreases towards the largest velocity offset. This suggests the existence of a two-phase (diffuse and clumpy) outflow. One possible scenario to produce such a two-phase outflow is an interaction between the jet and the interstellar medium, which possibly triggers shocks and/or star formation associated with the outflow.},

	abstract = {The strikingly anisotropic large-scale distribution of matter made of an extended network of voids delimited by sheets, themselves segmented by filaments, within which matter flows towards compact nodes where they intersect, imprints its geometry on the dynamics of cosmic flows, ultimately shaping the distribution of galaxies and the redshift evolution of their properties. The (filament-type) saddle points of this cosmic web provide a local frame in which to quantify the induced physical and morphological evolution of galaxies on large scales. The properties of virtual galaxies within the Horizon-{AGN} simulation are stacked in such a frame. The iso-contours of the galactic number density, mass, specific star formation rate ({sSFR}), kinematics and age are clearly aligned with the filament axis with steep gradients perpendicular to the filaments. A comparison to a simulation without feedback from active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) illustrates its impact on quenching star formation of centrals away from the saddles. The redshift evolution of the properties of galaxies and their age distribution are consistent with the geometry of the bulk flow within that frame. They compare well with expectations from constrained Gaussian random fields and the scaling with the mass of non-linearity, modulo the redshift dependent impact of feedback processes. Physical properties such as {sSFR} and kinematics seem not to depend only on mean halo mass and density: the residuals trace the geometry of the saddle, which could point to other environment-sensitive physical processes, such as spin advection, and {AGN} feedback at high mass.},

However, for the median halo mass and redshift of our sample, the virial temperature is close to the peak temperature for the Ne {VIII} ion, and the Ne {VIII}-bearing gas is plausibly collisionally ionized near this temperature. Moreover, we find that photoionized Ne {VIII} requires cool and low-density clouds that would be highly underpressured (by approximately two orders of magnitude) relative to the putative, ambient virialized medium, complicating scenarios where such clouds could survive. Thus, more complex (e.g., non-equilibrium) models may be required; this first statistical sample of Ne {VIII} absorber/galaxy systems will provide stringent constraints for future {CGM} studies.},

In contrast to most extant simulations of galaxy formation, which concentrate computational resources on galactic disks and spheroids with fluid and particle elements of fixed mass, the {FOGGIE} simulations focus on extreme spatial and mass resolution in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) surrounding galaxies. Using the Enzo code and a new refinement scheme, {FOGGIE} reaches spatial resolutions of 381 comoving \$h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ pc and resolves extremely low masses (\${\textbackslash}lesssim 1\$--\$100\$ Msun out to 100 comoving \$h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ kpc from the central halo. At these resolutions, cloud and filament-like structures giving rise to simulated absorption are smaller, and better resolved, than the same structures simulated with standard density-dependent refinement. Most of the simulated absorption arises in identifiable and well-resolved structures with masses \${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ Msun, well below the mass resolution of typical zoom simulations. However, integrated quantities such as mass surface density and ionic covering fractions change at only the \${\textbackslash}lesssim 30\$\% level as resolution is varied. This relatively small changes in projected quantities---even when the sizes and distribution of absorbing clouds change dramatically---indicate that commonly used observables provide only weak constraints on the physical structure of the underlying gas. Comparing the simulated absorption features to the {KODIAQ} (Keck Observatory Database of Ionized Absorption toward Quasars) survey of \$z {\textbackslash}sim2\$--\$3.5\$ Lyman limit systems, we show that high-resolution {FOGGIE} runs better resolve the internal kinematic structure of detected absorption, and better match the observed distribution of absorber properties. These results indicate that {CGM} resolution is key in properly testing simulations of galaxy evolution with circumgalactic observations.},

	abstract = {We examine the origin of scatter in the relationship between the gas fraction and mass of dark matter haloes hosting present-day \${\textbackslash}sim L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}star\$ central galaxies in the {EAGLE} simulations. The scatter is uncorrelated with the accretion rate of the central galaxy's black hole ({BH}), but correlates strongly and negatively with the {BH}'s mass, implicating differences in the expulsion of gas by active galactic nucleus feedback, throughout the assembly of the halo, as the main cause of scatter. Haloes whose central galaxies host undermassive {BHs} also tend to retain a higher gas fraction, and exhibit elevated star formation rates ({SFRs}). Diversity in the mass of central {BHs} stems primarily from diversity in the dark matter halo binding energy, as these quantities are strongly and positively correlated at fixed halo mass, such that \${\textbackslash}sim L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}star\$ galaxies hosted by haloes that are more (less) tightly-bound develop central {BHs} that are more (less) massive than is typical for their halo mass. Variations in the halo gas fraction at fixed halo mass are reflected in both the soft X-ray luminosity and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux, suggesting that the prediction of a strong coupling between the properties of galaxies and their halo gas fractions can be tested with measurements of these diagnostics for galaxies with diverse {SFRs} but similar halo masses.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the absorption properties of one of the tidal gas streams around the Whale galaxy {NGC}4631 in the direction of the quasar 2MASSJ12421031+3214268. Our study is based on ultraviolet spectral data obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph ({COS}) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}) and 21cm-data from the {HALOGAS} project and the Green Bank Telescope ({GBT}). We detect strong {HI} Ly alpha absorption in the velocity range +550 to +800 km s{\textasciicircum}-1 related to gas from a {NGC}4631 tidal stream known as Spur 2. We measure a column density of log N({HI})=18.68pm0.15, indicating that the quasar sightline traces the outer boundary of Spur 2 as seen in the 21cm data. Metal absorption in Spur 2 is detected in the lines of {OI}, {CII}, {SiII}, and {SiIII} in a complex absorption pattern that reflects the multi-phase nature of the gas. We find that the average neutral gas fraction in Spur 2 towards 2MASSJ12421031+3214268 is only 14 percent. This implies that ionized gas dominates the total mass of Spur 2, which then may comprise more than 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_sun. No significant depletion of Si is observed, showing that Spur 2 does not contain significant amounts of dust. From the measured {OI}/{HI} column-density ratio we determine an alpha abundance in Spur 2 of 0.13pm0.07 solar ([alpha/H]=-0.90pm 0.16), which is substantially lower than what is observed in the {NGC}4631 disk. The low metallicity and low dust content suggest that Spur 2 represents metal-deficient gas stripped off a gas-rich satellite galaxy during a recent encounter with {NGC}4631.},

The \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\${CO}(2-1) absorption is not associated with this component, which suggests that the cloud is either much smaller than 100 pc along our sight-line and/or located in low-metallicity gas that was possibly tidally stripped from the companion. We argue that the gas reservoir in {PKS} B1740-517 may have accreted onto the host galaxy \${\textbackslash}sim\$50 Myr before the young radio {AGN} was triggered, but has only recently reached the nucleus.

	abstract = {Precise stellar ages from asteroseismology have become available and can help setting stronger constraints on the evolution of the Galactic disc components. Recently, asteroseismology has confirmed a clear age difference in the solar annulus between two distinct sequences in the [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance ratios relation: the high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and low-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ stellar populations. We aim at reproducing these new data with chemical evolution models including different assumptions for the history and number of accretion events. We tested two different approaches: a revised version of the `two-infall' model where the high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ phase forms by a fast gas accretion episode and the low-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ sequence follows later from a slower gas infall rate, and the parallel formation scenario where the two disc sequences form coevally and independently. The revised `two-infall' model including uncertainties in age and metallicity is capable of reproducing: i) the [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] abundance relation at different Galactic epochs, ii) the age\$-\$metallicity relation and the time evolution [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe]; iii) the age distribution of the high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and low-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ stellar populations, iv) the metallicity distribution function. The parallel approach is not capable of properly reproduce the stellar age distribution, in particular at old ages. In conclusion, the best chemical evolution model is the revised `two-infall' one, where a consistent delay of \${\textbackslash}sim\$4.3 Gyr in the beginning of the second gas accretion episode is a crucial assumption to reproduce stellar abundances and ages.},

However, the specific mechanism of the realization of this bimodality is unknown. Here, we show that the cold flow hypothesis recently proposed for the accretion process of primordial gas onto forming galaxies predicts two episodes of star formation separated by a hiatus 6-7 Gyr ago and naturally explains the observed chemical bimodality. We found that the first phase of star formation that forms high [\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}/Fe] stars is caused by the 'genuine' cold flow, in which unheated primordial gas accretes to the galactic disk in a freefall fashion. The second episode of star formation that forms low [\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}/Fe] stars is sustained by much slower gas accretion as the once-heated gas gradually cools by radiation. The cold flow hypothesis can also explain the large-scale variation in the abundance pattern observed in the Milky Way galaxy in terms of the spatial variation of gas accretion history.},

The sample comprises 16 intermediate-redshift (z=0.21-0.55) {LRGs} of stellar mass M\_star{\textgreater}1e11 M\_sun. Combining far-ultraviolet Cosmic Origin Spectrograph spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope and optical echelle spectra from the ground enables a detailed ionization analysis based on resolved component structures of a suite of absorption transitions, including the full {HI} Lyman series and various ionic metal transitions. By comparing the relative abundances of different ions in individually-matched components, we show that cool gas (T{\textasciitilde}1e4 K) density and metallicity can vary by more than a factor of ten in a single halo. Specifically, metal-poor absorbing components with {\textless}1/10 solar metallicity are seen in 50\% of the {LRG} halos, while gas with solar and super-solar metallicity is also common. These results indicate a complex multiphase structure and poor chemical mixing in these quiescent halos. We calculate the total surface mass density of cool gas, {\textbackslash}Sigma\_cool, by applying the estimated ionization fraction corrections to the observed {HI} column densities. The radial profile of {\textbackslash}Sigma\_cool is best-described by a projected Einasto profile of slope {\textbackslash}alpha=1 and scale radius r\_s=48 kpc. We find that typical {LRGs} at z{\textasciitilde}0.4 contain cool gas mass of M\_cool= (1-2) x1e10 M\_sun at d{\textless}160 kpc (or as much as 4x1e10 M\_sun at d{\textless}500 kpc), comparable to the cool {CGM} mass of star-forming galaxies. Furthermore, we show that high-ionization {OVI} and low-ionization absorption species exhibit distinct velocity profiles, highlighting their different physical origins. We discuss the implications of our findings for the origin and fate of cool gas in {LRG} halos.},

	abstract = {We study the shape and evolution of the star formation main sequence in three independently developed semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. We focus, in particular, on the characterization of the model galaxies that are significantly above the main sequence, and that can be identified with galaxies classified as `starburst' in recent observational work. We find that, in all three models considered, star formation triggered by merger events (both minor and major) contribute to only a very small fraction of the cosmic density of star formation. While mergers are associated to bursts of star formation in all models, galaxies that experienced recent merger events are not necessarily significantly above the main sequence. On the other hand, `starburst galaxies' are not necessarily associated with merger episodes, especially at the low-mass end. Galaxies that experienced recent mergers can have relatively low levels of star formation when/if the merger is gas-poor, and galaxies with no recent merger can experience episodes of starbursts due to a combination of large amount of cold gas available from cooling/accretion events and/or small disk radii which increases the cold gas surface density.},

The narrow and broad components of the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission are used to simultaneously determine the local star formation rate surface density (\${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$), and the outflow velocity \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm out\}\$ and mass outflow rate \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm out\}\$, respectively. We find clear evidence for faster outflows with larger mass loading factors at higher \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$. The outflow velocities scale as \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm out\} {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}{\textasciicircum}\{0.28 {\textbackslash}pm 0.10\}\$, which suggests that the outflows may be driven by a combination of mechanical energy released by supernova explosions and stellar winds, as well as radiation pressure acting on dust grains. The majority of the outflowing material does not have sufficient velocity to escape from the galaxy halos, but will likely be re-accreted and contribute to the chemical enrichment of the galaxies. The outflow component contains on average \${\textbackslash}sim\$35\% of the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ flux at \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim{\textasciitilde}1.3{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm kpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, but becomes less prominent at lower \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$. The mass loading factor, \${\textbackslash}eta\$ = \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm out\}\$/{SFR}, is positively correlated with the \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$ but is relatively low even at the highest \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$ (\${\textbackslash}eta{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.3\$, assuming \$n\_e{\textasciitilde}={\textasciitilde}380{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$).

	abstract = {Aims. With the aim of performing an analysis of the orientations of galaxy pair systems with respect to the underlying large-scale structure, we study the alignment between the axis connecting the pair galaxies and the host cosmic filament where the pair resides. In addition, we analyze the dependence of the amplitude of the alignment on the morphology of pair members as well as filament properties. Methods. We build a galaxy pair catalog requiring \$r\_p {\textless} 100{\textbackslash}kpc\$ and \${\textbackslash}Delta V {\textless} 500 {\textbackslash}kms \$ within redshift \$z{\textless}0.1\$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS}). We divided the galaxy pair catalog taking into account the morphological classification by defining three pair categories composed by elliptical-elliptical (E-E), elliptical-spiral (E-S) and spiral-spiral (S-S) galaxies. We use a previously defined catalog of filaments obtained from {SDSS} and we select pairs located closer than \$1{\textbackslash}mpc\$ from the filament spine, which are considered as members of filaments. For these pairs, we calculate the relative angle between the axis connecting each galaxy, and the direction defined by the spine of the parent filament. Results. We find a statistically significant alignment signal between the pair axes and the spine of the host filaments consistent with a relative excess of \$ {\textbackslash}sim\$ 15{\textbackslash}\% aligned pairs. We obtain that pairs composed by elliptical galaxies exhibit a stronger alignment, showing a higher alignment signal for pairs closer than 200 \${\textbackslash}kpc\$ to the filament spine. In addition, we find that the aligned pairs are associated with luminous host filaments populated with a high fraction of elliptical galaxies. The findings of this work show that large scale structures play a fundamental role in driving galactic anisotropic accretion as induced by galaxy pairs exhibiting a preferred alignment along the filament direction.},

We find singly and doubly ionized metal species and {HI} typically have similar velocity profiles, implying they probe gas in the same or similar environments. The column density ionic ratios (e.g., {CII}/{CIII}, {OI}/{CII}) indicate the gas in these absorbers is largely ionized, and the ionization conditions are quite comparable across the sampled N({HI}) range. The Doppler parameters of the {HI} imply T{\textless}50,000 K on average, consistent with the gas being photoionized. The {MgII} column densities span {\textgreater}2 orders of magnitude at any given N({HI}), indicating a wide range of metallicities (from solar to {\textless}1/100 solar). In the range 16.2{\textless}log N({HI}){\textless}17, there is a gap in the N({MgII}) distribution corresponding to gas with {\textasciitilde}10\% solar metallicity, consistent with the gap seen in the previously identified bimodal metallicity distribution in this column density regime.

	abstract = {We analyze 88 independent high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of disk galaxies in the {NIHAO} simulations suite to explore the connection between the atomic gas fraction and angular momentum of baryons throughout cosmic time. The study is motivated by the analytic model of {\textbackslash}citet\{obreschkow16\}, which predicts a relation between the atomic gas fraction \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm atm\}\$ and the global atomic stability parameter \$q {\textbackslash}equiv j{\textbackslash}sigma / ({GM})\$, where \$M\$ and \$j\$ are the mass and specific angular momentum of the galaxy (stars+cold gas) and \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ is the velocity dispersion of the atomic gas. We show that the simulated galaxies follow this relation from their formation (\$z{\textbackslash}simeq4\$) to present within \${\textbackslash}sim 0.5\$ dex. To explain this behavior, we explore the evolution of the local Toomre stability and find that \$90{\textbackslash}\%\$--\$100{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the atomic gas in all simulated galaxies is stable at any time. In other words, throughout the entire epoch of peak star formation until today, the timescale for accretion is longer than the timescale to reach equilibrium, thus resulting in a quasi-static equilibrium of atomic gas at any time. Hence, the evolution of \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm atm\}\$ depends on the complex hierarchical growth history primarily via the evolution of \$q\$. An exception are galaxies subject to strong environmental effects.},

Here, we study the nature of a Lyman Limit system ({LLS}) with N({HI})=10\${\textasciicircum}\{19.1{\textbackslash}pm0.3\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ and a dust-uncorrected metallicity of [Fe/H]\$=-1.1{\textbackslash}pm0.3\$ at \$z=0.78\$ towards Q0152\$-020\$. The {MgII} absorption profiles are composed of a main saturated and a few weaker optically thin components. Using {MUSE} observations we detect one galaxy close to the absorption redshift at an impact parameter of 54 kpc. This galaxy exhibits nebular emission lines from which we measure a dust-corrected star formation rate of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{+8\}\_\{-5\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and an emission metallicity of [O/H]\$=-0.1{\textbackslash}pm0.2\$.

The results are based on high-quality archival ultraviolet/optical/radio data from various different instruments ({HST}/{STIS}, {FUSE}, {AAT}, {GBT}, {GB}140ft, {ATCA}). Our study updates previous results from lower-resolution data and provides for the first time a self-consistent component model of the complex multi-phase absorber, delivering important constraints on the nature and origin of {LAII}. We derive a uniform, moderate alpha abundance in the two main absorber groups at +245 and +190 km s{\textasciicircum}-1 of alpha/H = 0.30 pm 0.05 solar, a low nitrogen abundance of N/H = 0.05 pm 0.01 solar, and a high dust content with substantial dust depletion values for Si, Fe, Al, and Ca. These alpha, N, and dust abundances in {LAII} are similar to those observed in the Small Magellanic Cloud ({SMC}). From the analysis of the H\_2 absorption, we determine a high thermal pressure of P/k = 1680 K cm{\textasciicircum}-3 in {LAII}, in line with the idea that {LAII} is located in the inner Milky Way halo at a z-height of {\textless}20 kpc where it hydrodynamically interacts with the ambient hot coronal gas.

This is done utilizing two different suites of zoom-in hydro-cosmological simulations, {VELA} and {NIHAO}, which yield consistent results despite the different codes and different physical recipes for star formation and feedback. We find that collisional ionization by thermal electrons dominates at high redshift, while photoionization of cool or warm gas by the metagalactic radiation takes over near \$z {\textbackslash}sim 2\$. In halos of \${\textbackslash}sim\$10\${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and above, collisions become important again at \$z{\textless}0.5\$, while photoionization remains significant down to \$z=0\$ for less massive halos. In halos with M {\textgreater} \$3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, most of the photoionized gas at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 0\$ is in the warm phase, just below the {OVI} peak (\$T {\textbackslash}lesssim 3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}5\$ K). We also find that collisions are dominant in the central regions of halos, while photoionization is more significant at the outskirts, around \$\{{\textbackslash}rm R\_v\}\$, even in massive halos. This too may be explained by the presence of warm gas or, in lower mass halos, by cool gas inflows. The position in redshift of the peak in the photoionized {OVI} fraction is dependent on feedback implementation. In the future, observational estimation of the peak redshift can be used to test feedback implementation in simulations. The penetration of cool gas into the warm-hot {CGM} of high-mass halos also depends on the accretion rate and feedback strength.},

We have improved the method of analysis of the alignment of galaxies in clusters. Now, the method allowed analysis both position angles of galaxy major axes and two angles describing the spatial orientation of galaxies. The distributions of analyzed angles were tested for isotropy by applying different statistical tests. For sample of analyzed clusters we have computed the mean values of analyzed statistics, checking whether they are the same as expected ones in the case of random distribution of analyzed angles. The detailed discussion of this method has been performed. We have shown how to proceed in many particular cases in order to improve the statistical reasoning when analyzing the distribution of the angles in the observational data. Separately, we have compared these new results with those obtained from numerical simulations. We show the powerful of our method on the example of galaxy orientation analysis in 247 Abell rich galaxy clusters. We have found that the orientations of galaxies in analyzed clusters are not random. It means that we genuinely confirmed an existence of the alignment of galaxies in rich Abells' galaxy clusters. This result is independent from the clusters of Bautz-Morgan types.},

	abstract = {The circumgalactic medium ({CGM}), i.e. the gaseous haloes around galaxies, is both the reservoir of gas that fuels galaxy growth and the repository of gas expelled by galactic winds. Most cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations focus their computational effort on the galaxies themselves and treat the {CGM} more coarsely, which means small-scale structure cannot be resolved. We get around this issue by running zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with standard mass refinement and additional uniform spatial refinement within the virial radius. This results in a detailed view of its gaseous halo at unprecedented (1 kpc) uniform resolution with only a moderate increase in computational time. The improved spatial resolution does not impact the central galaxy or the average density of the {CGM}. However, it drastically changes the radial profile of the neutral hydrogen column density, which is enhanced at galactocentric radii larger than 40 kpc. The covering fraction of Lyman-Limit Systems within 150 kpc is almost doubled. We therefore conclude that some of the observational properties of the {CGM} are strongly resolution dependent. Increasing the resolution in the {CGM}, without increasing the resolution of the galaxies, is a promising and computationally efficient method to push the boundaries of state-of-the-art simulations.},

We analyse the origin of differences between physical properties of satellites and those of their central counterparts, identified by matching the Vmax of their host haloes at the accretion time of the satellites. Our model reproduces nicely the differences between centrals and satellites measured for the {HI} mass, size of the star-forming region, and stellar radii. In contrast, our model predicts larger differences with respect to data for the molecular gas mass and star formation rate. By analysing the progenitors of central and satellite model galaxies, we find that differences in the gas content arise after accretion, and can be entirely ascribed to the instantaneous stripping of the hot gas reservoir. The suppression of cold gas replenishment via cooling and star formation leads to a reduction of the cold gas and of its density. Therefore, more molecular gas is lost than lower density {HI} gas, and model satellites have less molecular gas and lower star formation rates than observed satellites. We argue that these disagreements could be largely resolved with the inclusion of a proper treatment for ram-pressure stripping of cold gas and a more gradual stripping of the hot gas reservoir. A more sophisticated treatment of angular momentum exchanges, accounting for the multi-phase nature of the gaseous disc is also required.},

The data map the kinematics of a three billion solar mass filamentary nebula that spans the innermost 30 kpc of the galaxy's core. Its warm ionized and cold molecular components are both cospatial and comoving, consistent with the hypothesis that the optical nebula traces the warm envelopes of many cold molecular clouds that drift in the velocity field of the hot X-ray atmosphere. The clouds are not in dynamical equilibrium, and instead show evidence for inflow toward the central supermassive black hole, outflow along the jets it launches, and uplift by the buoyant hot bubbles those jets inflate. The entire scenario is therefore consistent with a galaxy-spanning "fountain", wherein cold gas clouds drain into the black hole accretion reservoir, powering jets and bubbles that uplift a cooling plume of low-entropy multiphase gas, which may stimulate additional cooling and accretion as part of a self-regulating feedback loop. All velocities are below the escape speed from the galaxy, and so these clouds should rain back toward the galaxy center from which they came, keeping the fountain long-lived. The data are consistent with major predictions of chaotic cold accretion, precipitation, and stimulated feedback models, and may trace processes fundamental to galaxy evolution at effectively all mass scales.},

	abstract = {Nuclear outflows driven by accreting massive black holes are one of the main feedback mechanisms invoked at high-z to reproduce the distinct separation between star-forming, disk galaxies and quiescent spheroidal systems. Yet, our knowledge of feedback at high-z remains limited by the lack of observations of the multiple gas phases in galaxy outflows. In this work we use new deep, high-spatial resolution {ALMA} {CO}(3-2) and archival {VLT}/{SINFONI} H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ observations to study the molecular and ionized components of the {AGN}-driven outflow in {zC}400528 ---a massive, main sequence galaxy at z=2.3 in the process of quenching. We detect a powerful molecular outflow that shows a positive velocity gradient and extends for at least {\textasciitilde}10 kpc from the nuclear region, about three times the projected size of the ionized wind. The molecular gas in the outflow does not reach velocities high enough to escape the galaxy and is therefore expected to be reaccreted. Keeping in mind the various assumptions involved in the analysis, we find that the mass and energetics of the outflow are dominated by the molecular phase. The {AGN}-driven outflow in {zC}400528 is powerful enough to deplete the molecular gas reservoir on a timescale at least twice shorter than that needed to exhaust it by star formation. This suggests that the nuclear outflow is one of the main quenching engines at work in the observed suppression of the central star-formation activity in {zC}400528.},

When we run pairs of 'shadow' simulations that are identical except for random minute initial displacements to particle positions (e.g. of order 1e-7pc), the results diverge from each other at the individual galaxy level (while the statistical properties of the ensemble of galaxies are unchanged). After cosmological times, the global properties of pairs of 'shadow' galaxies that are matched between the simulations differ from each other generally at a level of {\textasciitilde}2-25\%, depending on the considered physical quantity. We perform these experiments using cosmological volumes of (25-50Mpc/h){\textasciicircum}3 evolved either purely with dark matter, or with baryons and star-formation but no feedback, or using the full feedback model of the {IllustrisTNG} project. The runs cover four resolution levels spanning a factor of 512 in mass. We find that without feedback the differences between shadow galaxies generally become smaller as the resolution increases, but with the {IllustrisTNG} model the results are mostly converging towards a 'floor'. This hints at the role of feedback in setting the chaotic properties of galaxy formation. Importantly, we compare the macroscopic differences between shadow galaxies to the overall scatter in various galaxy scaling relations, and conclude that for the star formation-mass and the Tully-Fisher relations the butterfly effect in our simulations contributes significantly to the overall scatter. We find that our results are robust to whether random numbers are used in the sub-grid models or not. We discuss the implications for galaxy formation theory in general and for cosmological simulations in particular.},

Here we present high-resolution idealised simulations of the interaction of a hot supersonic wind with a cold cloud with the moving-mesh code arepo in setups with and without radiative cooling. We demonstrate that cooling causes clouds with sizes larger than the cooling length to fragment in two- and three-dimensional simulations (2D and 3D). We confirm earlier 2D simulations by {McCourt} et al. 2018 and highlight differences of the shattering processes of 3D clouds that are exposed to a hot wind. The fragmentation process is quantified with a friends-of-friends analysis of shattered cloudlets and density power spectra. Those show that radiative cooling causes the power spectral index to gradually increase when the initial cloud radius is larger than the cooling length and with increasing time until the cloud is fully dissolved in the hot wind. A resolution of around 1 pc is required to reveal the effect of cooling-induced fragmentation of a 100 pc outflowing cloud. Thus, state-of-the-art cosmological zoom simulations of the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) fall short by orders of magnitudes from resolving this fragmentation process. This physics is, however, necessary to reliably model observed column densities and covering fractions of Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ haloes, high-velocity clouds, and broad-line regions of active galactic nuclei.},

	abstract = {The majority of baryons reside beyond the optical extent of a galaxy in the circumgalactic and intergalactic media ({CGM}/{IGM}). Gaseous halos are inextricably linked to the appearance of their host galaxies through a complex story of accretion, feedback, and continual recycling. The energetic processes, which define the state of gas in the {CGM}, are the same ones that 1) regulate stellar growth so that it is not over-efficient, and 2) create the diversity of today's galaxy colors, {SFRs}, and morphologies spanning Hubble's Tuning Fork Diagram. They work in concert to set the speed of growth on the star-forming Main Sequence, transform a galaxy across the Green Valley, and maintain a galaxy's quenched appearance on the Red Sequence. Most baryons in halos more massive than 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msolar along with their high-energy physics and dynamics remain invisible because that gas is heated above the {UV} ionization states. We argue that information on many of the essential drivers of galaxy evolution is primarily contained in this "missing" hot gas phase. Completing the picture of galaxy formation requires uncovering the physical mechanisms behind stellar and {SMBH} feedback driving mass, metals, and energy into the {CGM}. By opening galactic hot halos to new wavebands, we not only obtain fossil imprints of {\textgreater}13 Gyrs of evolution, but observe on-going hot-mode accretion, the deposition of superwind outflows into the {CGM}, and the re-arrangement of baryons by {SMBH} feedback. A description of the flows of mass, metals, and energy will only be complete by observing the thermodynamic states, chemical compositions, structure, and dynamics of T{\textgreater}=10{\textasciicircum}6 K halos. These measurements are uniquely possible with a next-generation X-ray observatory if it provides the sensitivity to detect faint {CGM} emission, spectroscopic power to measure absorption lines and gas motions, and high spatial resolution to resolve structures.},

It contains the majority of the baryonic matter associated with a galaxy, along with most of the metals, and must continually replenish the star forming gas in galaxies that continue to sustain star formation. And while the {CGM} is complex, containing gas ranging over orders of magnitude in temperature and density, a simple emergent property may be governing its structure and role. Observations increasingly suggest that the ambient {CGM} pressure cannot exceed the limit at which cold clouds start to condense out and precipitate toward the center of the potential well. If feedback fueled by those clouds then heats the {CGM} and causes it to expand, the pressure will drop and the "rain" will diminish.

In the second paper of this series, we determine the mass and energetics of ionized outflows is 234 type {II} {AGN}, the largest such sample to date, by combining the infrared emission of the dust in the wind (paper I) with the emission line properties. We provide new general expressions for the properties of the outflowing gas, which depend on the ionization state of the gas. We also present a novel method to estimate the electron density in the outflow, based on optical line ratios and on the known location of the wind. The inferred electron densities, \$n\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{e\}\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{4.5\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{(cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\})\}\$, are two orders of magnitude larger than typically found in most other cases of ionized outflows. We argue that the discrepancy is due to the fact that the commonly-used [{SII}]-based method underestimates the true density by a large factor. As a result, the inferred mass outflow rates and kinetic coupling efficiencies are \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{out\}\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{(M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}/yr)\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}epsilon = {\textbackslash}dot\{E\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kin\}\}/L\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{bol\}\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ respectively, 1--2 orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. Our analysis suggests the existence of a significant amount of neutral atomic gas at the back of the outflowing ionized gas clouds, with mass that is a factor of a few larger than the observed ionized gas mass. This has significant implications for the estimated mass and energetics of such flows.},

Across the stellar mass range \$8.5 {\textless} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}({\textbackslash}langle M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\} {\textbackslash}rangle/{\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}) {\textless} 10.2\$ we find a strong correlation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass, with stellar metallicity monotonically increasing from \$Z\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Z\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textless} 0.09\$ at \${\textbackslash}langle M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\} {\textbackslash}rangle = 3.2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{8\} {\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ to \$Z\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}/Z\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} = 0.27\$ at \${\textbackslash}langle M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\} {\textbackslash}rangle = 1.7 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} {\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. In contrast, at a given stellar mass, we find no evidence for significant metallicity evolution across the redshift range of our sample. However, comparing our results to the \$z=0\$ stellar mass-metallicity relation, we find that the \${\textbackslash}langle z {\textbackslash}rangle = 3.5\$ relation is consistent with being shifted to lower metallicities by \${\textbackslash}simeq 0.6\$ dex. Contrasting our derived stellar metallicities with estimates of gas-phase metallicities at similar redshifts, we find evidence for enhanced \${\textbackslash}rm\{O\}/{\textbackslash}rm\{Fe\}\$ ratios of the order (O/Fe) \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 1.8\$ \${\textbackslash}times\$ (O/Fe)\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. Finally, by comparing our results to simulation predictions, we find that the \${\textbackslash}langle z {\textbackslash}rangle = 3.5\$ stellar mass-metallicity relation is consistent with current predictions for how outflow strength scales with galaxy mass.

	abstract = {We present a Bayesian full-spectral-fitting analysis of 75 massive (\$M\_* {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.3\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) {UVJ}-selected galaxies at redshifts of \$1.0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.3\$, combining extremely deep rest-frame ultraviolet spectroscopy from {VANDELS} with multi-wavelength photometry. By the use of a sophisticated physical plus systematic uncertainties model, constructed within the Bagpipes code, we place strong constraints on the star-formation histories ({SFHs}) of individual objects. We firstly constrain the stellar mass vs stellar age relationship, finding a strong trend towards earlier formation with increasing stellar mass (downsizing) of \$1.48{\textasciicircum}\{+0.34\}\_\{-0.39\}\$ Gyr per decade in mass. We show that this is consistent with other spectroscopic studies from \$0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2\$. This relationship places strong constraints on the {AGN}-feedback models used in cosmological simulations. We demonstrate that, although the relationships predicted by Simba and {IllustrisTNG} agree well with observations at \$z=0.1\$, they are too shallow at \$z=1\$, predicting an evolution of \${\textbackslash}lesssim0.5\$ Gyr per decade in mass. Secondly, we consider the connections between green-valley, post-starburst and quiescent galaxies, using our inferred {SFH} shapes and the distributions of galaxy physical properties on the {UVJ} diagram. The majority of our lowest-mass galaxies (\$M\_* {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) are consistent with formation in recent (\$z{\textless}2\$), intense starburst events, with timescales of \${\textbackslash}lesssim500\$ Myr. A second class of objects experience extended star-formation epochs before rapidly quenching, passing through both green-valley and post-starburst phases. The most massive galaxies in our sample are extreme systems: already old by \$z=1\$, they formed at \$z{\textbackslash}sim5\$ and quenched by \$z=3\$. However, we find evidence for their continued evolution through both {AGN} and rejuvenated star-formation activity.},

	abstract = {Galaxies are surrounded by extended atmospheres, which are often called the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) and are the least understood part of galactic ecosystems. The {CGM} serves as a reservoir of both diffuse, metal-poor gas accreted from the intergalactic medium, and metal-rich gas that is either ejected from galaxies by energetic feedback or stripped from infalling satellites. As such, the {CGM} is empirically multi-phased and complex in dynamics. Significant progress has been made in the past decade or so in observing the cosmic-ray/B-field, as well as various phases of the {CGM}. But basic questions remain to be answered. First, what are the energy, mass, and metal contents of the {CGM}? More specifically, how are they spatially distributed and partitioned in the different components? Moreover, how are they linked to properties of host galaxies and their global clustering and intergalactic medium environments? Lastly, what are the origin, state, and life-cycle of the {CGM}? This question explores the dynamics of the {CGM}. Here we illustrate how these questions may be addressed with multi-wavelength observations of the {CGM}.},

	abstract = {The binary neutron star merger {GW}170817 detected by Advanced {LIGO}/Virgo was followed by a short gamma-ray burst ({GRB}) and thermal radiation ('kilonova') powered by the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei synthesized in the merger ejecta by the rapid neutron capture process ('r-process'). The large inferred quantity of ejecta is best understood as originating in an outflow from the accretion disk surrounding the newly-formed black hole, the same engine that was likely responsible for the {GRB} jet. Similar accretion flows accompany the collapse of rotating massive stars ('collapsars'), powering the class of long {GRBs} and their associated supernovae. Here we show that collapsar accretion disks also produce neutron-rich outflows that synthesize heavy r-process nuclei, despite the comparatively proton-rich composition of the infalling star. Though occurring less frequently than mergers, the much greater accreted mass in collapsars---and their correspondingly larger disk wind ejecta---implicate them as dominant contributors to the Galactic r-process. Collapsars provide the rare r-process source needed to promptly enrich a small fraction of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies early in the Universe which is also compatible with the Galactic chemical enrichment of europium relative to iron over longer timescales. We predict an excess in the late-time near-infrared emission from {GRB} supernovae, testable by future observations.},

	abstract = {The impact of 2-body scattering on the innermost density profiles of dark matter haloes is well established. We use a suite of cosmological simulations and idealised numerical experiments to show that 2-body scattering is exacerbated in situations where there are two species of unequal mass. This is a consequence of mass segregation and reflects a flow of kinetic energy from the more to less massive particles. This has important implications for the interpretation of galaxy sizes in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations which nearly always model stars with less massive particles than are used for the dark matter. We compare idealised models as well as simulations from the {EAGLE} project that differ only in the mass resolution of the dark matter component, but keep sub-grid physics, baryonic mass resolution and gravitational force softening fixed. If the dark matter particle mass exceeds the mass of stellar particles, then galaxy sizes--quantified by their projected half-mass radii, \$\{{\textbackslash}rm R\_\{50\}\}\$--increase systematically with time until \$\{{\textbackslash}rm R\_\{50\}\}\$ exceeds a small fraction of the redshift-dependent mean inter-particle separation, \$l\$ (\$\{{\textbackslash}rm R\_\{50\}\}{\textbackslash}geq 0.05{\textbackslash}times l\$). Our conclusions should also apply to simulations that adopt different hydrodynamic solvers, subgrid physics or adaptive softening, but in that case may need quantitative revision. Any simulation employing a stellar-to-dark matter particle mass ratio greater than unity will escalate spurious energy transfer from dark matter to baryons on small scales.},

	abstract = {(abridged) Observing the signature of accretion from the intergalactic medium ({IGM}) onto galaxies at z{\textasciitilde}3 requires the detection of faint (L{\textless}{\textless}L*) galaxies embedded in a filamentary matrix of low-density, metal-poor gas coherent over hundreds of kpc. We study the gaseous environment of three Lyman\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emitters ({LAEs}) at z=2.7-2.8, found to be aligned in projection with a background {QSO} over {\textasciitilde}250 kpc along the slit of a long-slit spectrum. The lack of detection of the {LAEs} in deep continuum images and the low inferred Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosities show the {LAEs} to be intrinsically faint, low-mass galaxies (L{\textless}0.1 L*, M\_star{\textless} 0.1 M*). An echelle spectrum of the {QSO} reveals strong Ly-alpha absorption within \${\textbackslash}pm200\$ km/s from the {LAEs}. Our absorption line analysis leads to {HI} column densities in the range of log N({HI}) =16-18. Associated absorption from ionic metal species {CIV} and {SiIV} constrains the gas metallicities to {\textasciitilde}0.01 solar if the gas is optically thin, and possibly as low as {\textasciitilde}0.001 solar if the gas is optically thick, assuming photoionization equilibrium. While the inferred metallicities are at least a factor of ten lower than expected metallicities in the interstellar medium ({ISM}) of these {LAEs}, they are consistent with the observed chemical enrichment level in the {IGM} at the same epoch. Total metal abundances and kinematic arguments suggest that these faint galaxies have not been able to affect the properties of their surrounding gas. The projected spatial alignment of the {LAEs}, together with the kinematic quiescence and correspondence between the {LAEs} and absorbing gas in velocity space suggests that these observations probe a possible filamentary structure. Taken together with the blue-dominant Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission line profile of one of the objects, the evidence suggests that the absorbing gas is part of an accretion stream of low-metallicity gas in the {IGM}.},

We examine the gas disk and tail properties of stripped cluster galaxies in eight "wind-tunnel" hydrodynamical simulations with either varying or constant ram pressure strength. In simulations without radiative cooling, applying a varying wind leads to significantly different density and velocity structure in the tail than found when applying a constant wind, although the stripping rate, disk mass, and disk radius remain consistent in both scenarios. In simulations with radiative cooling, the differences between a constant and varying wind are even more pronounced. Not only is there a difference in morphology and velocity structure in the tails, but a varying wind leads to a much lower stripping rate, even after the varying wind has reached the ram pressure strength of the constant wind. Also, galaxies in constant and varying wind simulations with the same gas disk mass do not have in the same gas disk radius. A constant wind cannot appropriately model the ram pressure stripping of a galaxy entering a cluster. We conclude that simulations attempting detailed comparisons with observations must take the variation of the ram pressure profile due to a galaxy's orbit into consideration.},

	abstract = {Recent Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest tomography measurements of the intergalactic medium ({IGM}) have revealed a wealth of cosmic structures at high redshift (\$z{\textbackslash}sim 2.5\$). In this work, we present the Tomographic Absorption Reconstruction and Density Inference Scheme ({TARDIS}), a new chrono-cosmographic analysis tool for understanding the formation and evolution of these observed structures. We use maximum likelihood techniques with a fast non-linear gravitational model to reconstruct the initial density field of the observed regions. We find that {TARDIS} allows accurate reconstruction of smaller scale structures than standard Wiener filtering techniques. Applying this technique to mock Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest data sets that simulate ongoing and future surveys such as {CLAMATO}, Subaru-{PFS} or the {ELTs}, we are able to infer the underlying matter density field at observed redshift and classify the cosmic web structures. We find good agreement with the underlying truth both in the characteristic eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the pseudo-deformation tensor, with the eigenvalues inferred from 30m-class telescopes correlated at \$r=0.95\$ relative to the truth. As an output of this method, we are able to further evolve the inferred structures to late time (\$z=0\$), and also track the trajectories of coeval \$z=2.5\$ galaxies to their \$z=0\$ cosmic web environments.},

By jellyfish galaxies, we mean satellites orbiting in massive groups and clusters that exhibit highly asymmetric distributions of gas and gas tails. We use the {TNG}100 run and select galaxies at redshifts \$z{\textbackslash}le0.6\$ with stellar mass exceeding \$10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and with host halo masses of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{14.6\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. Among more than about 6000 (2600) galaxies with stars (and some gas), we identify 800 jellyfish galaxies by visually inspecting their gas and stellar mass maps in random projections. About \$31{\textbackslash}\%\$ of cluster satellites are found with signatures of ram-pressure stripping and gaseous tails stemming from the main luminous bodies. This is a lower limit, since the random orientation entails a loss of about \$30{\textbackslash}\%\$ of galaxies that in an optimal projection would otherwise be identified as jellyfish. The connection with ram-pressure stripping is further confirmed by a series of findings: jellyfish galaxies are more frequent at intermediate and large cluster-centric distances (\$r/R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 200c\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.25\$); they move through the {ICM} with larger bulk velocities and Mach numbers than the general cluster population, typically orbiting supersonically and experiencing larger ram pressures. Furthermore, the gaseous tails usually extend in opposite directions to the galaxy trajectory, with no relation between tail orientation and the host's center. The frequency of jellyfish galaxies shows a very weak dependence on redshift \$(0{\textbackslash}le z{\textbackslash}le0.6)\$ but larger fractions of disturbed gaseous morphologies occur in more massive hosts and at smaller satellite masses. Finally, jellyfish galaxies are late infallers (\${\textless} 2.5-3\$ Gyrs ago, at \$z=0\$) and the emergence of gaseous tails correlates well with the presence of bow shocks in the {ICM}.},

This observational fact poses a severe challenge to our theoretical models of galaxy evolution since most feedback mechanisms (e.g., supernovae feedback) accelerate hot gas, and the timescale it takes to accelerate a blob of cold gas via a hot wind is much larger than the time it takes to destroy the blob. We revisit this long-standing problem using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with radiative cooling. Our results confirm previous findings, that cooling is often not efficient enough to prevent the destruction of cold gas. However, we also identify regions of parameter space where the cooling efficiency of the mixed, `warm' gas is sufficiently large to contribute new comoving cold gas which can significantly exceed the original cold gas mass. This happens whenever, \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cool, mix\}\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cc\}\} {\textless} 1\$, where \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cool,mix\}\}\$ is the cooling time of the mixed warm gas and \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cc\}\}\$ is the cloud-crushing time. This criterion is always satisfied for a large enough cloud. Cooling `focuses' stripped material onto the tail where mixing takes place and new cold gas forms. A sufficiently large simulation domain is crucial to capturing this behavior.},

Far-{UV} space telescopes have enabled detailed studies of the {ISM} in the Milky Way, paving the way to understand in particular depletion of elements by condensation onto dust grains, molecular gas formation pathways, ionization processes, and the dynamics of shocks.

To circumvent current systematic biases in column density determinations and to examine the {ISM} enrichment as a function of the environment, we advocate for a versatile far-{UV} space mission able to observe individual O/B stars or stellar clusters in galaxies up to few 100s Mpc away with a spectral resolution power R{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{4-5\}.

Using the {EAGLE} cosmological hydrodynamic simulation suite, we study cold gas accretion onto galaxies and the observational signatures of the cold gas kinematics. For {EAGLE} galaxies at z=0.27, we find that cold gas accretes onto galaxies anisotropically with typical inflow speeds between 20 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and 60 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Most of these galaxies have comparable mass inflow rates and star formation rates, implying that the cold inflowing gas plausibly accounts for sustaining the star-forming activities of the galaxies. As motivation for future work to compare the cold gas kinematics with measurements from quasar sightline observations, we select an {EAGLE} galaxy with an extended cold gas disk, and we probe the cold gas using mock quasar sightlines. We demonstrate that by viewing the disk edge-on, sightlines at azimuthal angles below 10\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ and impact parameters out to 60 pkpc can detect cold gas that corotates with the galaxy disk.

Both web finders return similar filamentary structures that are well aligned and that contain comparable galaxy populations. {EAGLE} haloes have an identical spin alignment with filaments as their counterparts in dark matter only simulations: a complex mass dependent trend with low mass haloes spinning preferentially parallel to and high mass haloes spinning preferentially perpendicular to filaments. In contrast, galaxy spins do not show such a spin transition and have a propensity for perpendicular alignments at all masses, with the degree of alignment being largest for massive galaxies. This result is valid for both {NEXUS}+ and Bisous filaments. When splitting by morphology, we find that elliptical galaxies show a stronger orthogonal spin--filament alignment than spiral galaxies of similar mass. The same is true of their haloes, with the host haloes of elliptical galaxies having a larger degree of orthogonal alignment than the host haloes of spirals. Due to the misalignment between galaxy shape and spin, galaxy minor axes are oriented differently with filaments than galaxy spins. We find that the galaxies whose minor axis is perpendicular to a filament are much better aligned with their host haloes. This suggests that many of the same physical processes determine both the galaxy--filament and the galaxy--halo alignments.},

The mean central {tSZ} signal for the full sample is y {\textasciitilde} 1.8 * 10{\textasciicircum}(-7) and we detect {tSZ} emission out to {\textasciitilde}30 arcmin, which is well beyond the 10 arcmin angular resolution of the y map and well beyond the virial radii of the {LRGs}. We compare the measured profile with predictions from the cosmo-{OWLS} suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. This comparison agrees well for models that include feedback from active galactic nuclei ({AGN}), but not with hydrodynamic models without this energetic feedback mechanism. This suggests that an additional heating mechanism is required over {SNe} feedback and star formation to explain the y data profile. We also compare our results with predictions based on the halo model with a universal pressure profile ({UPP}) giving the y signal. The predicted profile is consistent with the data, but only if we account for the clustering of haloes via a two-halo term and if halo masses are estimated using the mean stellar-to-halo mass ({SHM}) relation of Coupon et al. (2015) or Wang et al.(2016) estimated from gravitational lensing measurements. We also discuss the importance of scatter in the {SHM} relation on the model predictions.},

	abstract = {Galaxy formation depends on a complex interplay between gravitational collapse, gas accretion, merging, and feedback processes. Yet, after many decades of investigation, these concepts are poorly understood. This paper presents the argument that warm H\$\_2\$ can be used as a tool to unlock some of these mysteries. Turbulence, shocks and outflows, driven by star formation, {AGN} activity or inflows, may prevent the rapid buildup of star formation in galaxies. Central to our understanding of how gas is converted into stars is the process by which gas can dissipate its mechanical energy through turbulence and shocks in order to cool. H\$\_2\$ lines provide direct quantitative measurements of kinetic energy dissipation in molecular gas in galaxies throughout the Universe. Based on the detection of very powerful H\$\_2\$ lines from z = 2 galaxies and proto-clusters at the detection limits of \{{\textbackslash}it Spitzer\}, we are confident that future far-{IR} and {UV} H\$\_2\$ observations will provide a wealth of new information and insight into galaxy evolution to high-z. Finally, at the very earliest epoch of star and galaxy formation, warm H\$\_2\$ may also provide a unique glimpse of molecular gas collapse at 7 \${\textless}\$ z \${\textless}\$ 12 in massive dark matter ({DM}) halos on their way to forming the very first galaxies.

A new decade will bring fresh opportunities to further this progress towards developing a comprehensive view of the composition, thermal state, and physical processes of diffuse gas in the Universe. Ultraviolet ({UV}) spectroscopy, probing diffuse 10{\textasciicircum}4-10{\textasciicircum}6 K gas at high spectral resolution, is uniquely poised to (1) witness environmental galaxy quenching processes in action, such as strangulation and tidal- and ram-pressure stripping, (2) directly account for the baryon content of galaxy clusters in the cold-warm (T{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}6 K) gas, (3) determine the phase structure and kinematics of gas participating in the equilibrium-regulating exchange of energy at the cores of galaxy clusters, and (4) map cold streams and filaments of the Cosmic Web that feed galaxies and clusters. With a substantial {UV} undertaking beyond the Hubble Space Telescope, all of the above would be achievable over the entire epoch of galaxy cluster formation. Such capabilities, coupled with already-planned advancements at other wavelengths, will transform extragalactic astronomy by revealing the dominant formation and growth mechanisms of gaseous halos over the mass spectrum, settling the debate between early- and late-time metal enrichment scenarios, and revealing how the ecosystems in which galaxies reside ultimately facilitate their demise.},

	abstract = {The circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) of galaxies consists of a multiphase gas with components at very different temperatures, from \$10{\textasciicircum} \{4\}\$ K to \$10{\textasciicircum} \{7\}\$ K. One of the greatest puzzle about this medium is the presence of a large amount of low-temperature (\$T{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}4\$ K) gas around quiescent early-type galaxies ({ETGs}). Using semi-analytical parametric models, we describe the cool {CGM} around massive, low-redshift {ETGs} as the cosmological accretion of gas into their dark matter halos, resulting in an inflow of clouds from the external parts of the halos to the central galaxies. We compare our predictions with the observations of the {COS}-{LRG} collaboration. We find that inflow models can successfully reproduce the observed kinematics, the number of absorbers and the column densities of the cool gas. Our {MCMC} fit returns masses of the cool clouds of about \$10{\textasciicircum}5{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and shows that they must evaporate during their journey due to hydrodynamic interactions with the hot gas. We conclude that the cool gas present in the halos of {ETGs} likely cannot reach the central regions and feed the galaxy star formation, thus explaining why these passive objects are no longer forming stars.},

	abstract = {Observations show that (i) multiple gas phases can coexist in the atmospheres of galaxies and clusters; (ii) these atmospheres may be significantly rotating in the inner parts, with typical velocities that approach or even exceed the local sound speed. The thermal instability is a natural candidate to explain the formation of cold structures via condensation of a hotter gas phase. Here we systematically study the effect of rotation on the thermal stability of stratified plane-parallel atmospheres, using both analytical arguments and numerical simulations. We find that the formation of cold structures starting from small isobaric perturbations is enhanced in the regions where the rotation of the system is dynamically important (i.e. when the rotational velocity becomes comparable to the sound speed). In particular, the threshold value of the ratio between the cooling and dynamical time \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm dyn\}\$ below which condensations can form is increased by a factor up to \${\textbackslash}sim 10\$ in the presence of significant rotation.

Our community-wide movement toward highly multiwavelength and multidimensional datasets has enabled immense progress in each science frontier identified by the 2010 Decadal Survey, particularly with regard to black hole feedback and the cycle of baryons in galaxies. Facilities like {ALMA} and the next generation of integral field unit ({IFU}) spectrographs together enable mapping the physical conditions and kinematics of warm ionized and cold molecular gas in galaxies in unprecedented detail (Fig. 1). {JWST}'s launch at the start of the coming decade will push this capability to the rest-frame {UV} at redshifts z {\textgreater} 6, mapping the birth of stars in the first galaxies at cosmic dawn. Understanding of their subsequent evolution, however, now awaits an ability to map the processes that transform galaxies directly, rather than the consequences of those processes in isolation. In this paper, we argue that doing so requires an equivalent revolution in spatially resolved spectroscopy for the hot plasma that pervades galaxies, the atmospheres in which they reside, and the winds that are the engines of their evolution.},

The {CGM} is a major reservoir of galactic baryons and metals, and plays a key role in the long cycles of accretion, feedback, and recycling of gas that drive star formation. In order to fully understand the physical processes at work within galaxies, it is therefore essential to have a firm understanding of the composition, structure, kinematics, thermodynamics, and evolution of the {CGM}. In this white paper we outline connections between the {CGM} and galactic star formation histories, internal kinematics, chemical evolution, quenching, satellite evolution, dark matter halo occupation, and the reionization of the larger-scale intergalactic medium in light of the advances that will be made on these topics in the 2020s. We argue that, in the next decade, fundamental progress on all of these major issues depends critically on improved empirical characterization and theoretical understanding of the {CGM}. In particular, we discuss how future advances in spatially-resolved {CGM} observations at high spectral resolution, broader characterization of the {CGM} across galaxy mass and redshift, and expected breakthroughs in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations will help resolve these major problems in galaxy evolution.},

	abstract = {We present {ALMA} {CO}(2-1) observations toward a massive infrared dark cloud G28.37+0.07. The {ALMA} data reveal numerous molecular ({CO}) outflows with a wide range of sizes throughout the cloud. Sixty-two 1.3 mm continuum cores were identified to be driving molecular outflows. We have determined the position angle in the plane-of-sky of 120 {CO} outflow lobes and studied their distribution. We find that the distribution of the plane-of-sky outflow position angles peaks at about 100{\textbackslash}arcdeg{\textbackslash}, corresponding to a concentration of outflows with an approximately east-west direction. For most outflows, we have been able to estimate the plane-of-sky angle between the outflow axis and the filament that harbors the protostar that powers the outflow. Statistical tests strongly indicate that the distribution of outflow-filament orientations is consistent with most outflow axes being mostly orthogonal to their parent filament in 3D. Such alignment may result from filament fragmentation or continuous mass transportation from filament to the embedded protostellar core. The latter is suggested by recent numerical studies with moderately strong magnetic fields.},

However, such cold {CGM}, especially in local galaxies where its projected size on sky is expected to be of several arcminutes, cannot be imaged by {ALMA} due to interferometric spatial scale filtering of large-scale structures.

	abstract = {Filaments are ubiquitous structures in molecular clouds and play an important role in the mass assembly of stars. We present results of dynamical stability analyses for filaments in the infrared dark cloud G14.225\$-\$0.506, where a delayed onset of massive star formation was reported in the two hubs at the convergence of multiple filaments of parsec length. Full-synthesis imaging is performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array ({ALMA}) to map the \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{N\_2H{\textasciicircum}+\} {\textbackslash}; (1-0)\$ emission in two hub-filament systems with a spatial resolution of \${\textbackslash}sim 0.034 {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\}\$. Kinematics are derived from sophisticated spectral fitting algorithm that accounts for line blending, large optical depth, and multiple velocity components. We identify five velocity coherent filaments and derive their velocity gradients with principal component analysis. The mass accretion rates along the filaments are up to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\} {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\}\$ and are significant enough to affect the hub dynamics within one free-fall time (\${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}5 {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}\$). The \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{N\_2H{\textasciicircum}+\}\$ filaments are in equilibrium with virial parameter \${\textbackslash}alpha\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\} {\textbackslash}sim 1.2\$. We compare \${\textbackslash}alpha\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\$ measured in the \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{N\_2H{\textasciicircum}+\}\$ filaments, \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{{NH}\_3\}\$ filaments, \$870 {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$ dense clumps, and \$3 {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{mm\}\$ dense cores. The decreasing trend in \${\textbackslash}alpha\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\$ with decreasing spatial scales persists, suggesting an increasingly important role of gravity at small scales. Meanwhile, \${\textbackslash}alpha\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\$ also decreases with decreasing non-thermal motions. In combination with the absence of high-mass protostars and massive cores, our results are consistent with the global hierarchical collapse scenario.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00030},
	abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the physical processes that cause halo assembly bias -- the dependence of halo clustering on proxies of halo formation time. We focus on the origin of assembly bias in the mass range corresponding to the hosts of typical galaxies and use halo concentration as our chief proxy of halo formation time. We also repeat our key analyses across a broad range of halo masses and for alternative formation time definitions. We show that splashback subhaloes are responsible for two thirds of the assembly bias signal, but do not account for the entire effect. After splashback subhaloes have been removed, we find that the remaining assembly bias signal is due to a relatively small fraction (\${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textbackslash}\%\$) of haloes in dense regions. We test a number of additional physical processes thought to contribute to assembly bias and demonstrate that the two key processes are the slowing of mass growth by large-scale tidal fields and by the high velocities of ambient matter in sheets and filaments. We also rule out several other proposed physical causes of halo assembly bias. Based on our results, we argue that there are three processes that contribute to assembly bias of low-mass halos: large-scale tidal fields, gravitational heating due to the collapse of large-scale structures, and splashback subhaloes located outside the virial radius.},

	abstract = {We investigate a mechanism for accelerating cool (10\${\textasciicircum}4\$ K) clouds in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) with cosmic rays ({CRs}), possibly explaining some characteristics of observed high velocity clouds ({HVCs}). Enforcing {CRs} to stream down their pressure gradient into a region of slow streaming speed results in significant buildup of {CR} pressure which can accelerate the {CGM}. We present the results of the first two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ({MHD}) simulations of such `{CR} bottlenecks,' expanding on simpler simulations in 1D from {\textbackslash}cite\{wiener17a\}. Although much more investigation is required, we find two main results. First, radiative cooling in the interfaces of these clouds is sufficient to keep the cloud intact to {CR} wave heating. Second, cloud acceleration depends almost linearly with the injected {CR} flux at low values (comparable to that expected from a Milky Way-like star formation rate), but scales sublinearly at higher {CR} fluxes in 1D simulations. 2D simulations show hints of sublinear dependence at high {CR} fluxes but are consistent with pure linear dependence up to the {CR} fluxes tested. It is therefore plausible to accelerate cool clouds in the {CGM} to speeds of hundreds of km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$.},

There is no signature of non-equilibrium ionization.

Strong interstellar absorption in the soft X-ray band indicates that the plume is not a foreground source but is at the {GC} distance, giving a physical size of \${\textbackslash}sim\$100 pc, a density of 0.1 cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, thermal pressure of \$1{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-10\}\$ erg cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, mass of 600 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and thermal energy of \$7{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{50\}\$ erg.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02879},
	abstract = {Galaxy clusters and groups are thought to accrete material along the preferred direction of cosmic filaments. Yet these structures have proven difficult to detect due to their low contrast with few studies focusing on cluster infall regions. In this work, we detected cosmic filaments around galaxy clusters using photometric redshifts in the range 0.15{\textless}z{\textless}0.7. We characterised galaxy populations in these structures to study the influence of "pre-processing" by cosmic filaments and galaxy groups on star-formation quenching. The cosmic filament detection was performed using the {AMASCFI} Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey ({CFHTLS}) T0007 cluster sample (Sarron et al. 2018). The filament reconstruction was done with the {DISPERSE} algorithm in photometric redshift slices. We showed that this reconstruction is reliable for a {CFHTLS}-like survey at 0.15{\textless}z{\textless}0.7 using a mock galaxy catalogue. We split our galaxy catalogue in two populations (passive and star-forming) using the {LePhare} {SED} fitting algorithm and worked with two redshift bins (0.15{\textless}z{\textless}=0.4 and 0.4{\textless}z{\textless}0.7). We showed that the {AMASCFI} cluster connectivity (i.e. the number of filaments connecting to a cluster) increases with cluster mass M200. Filament galaxies outside R200 are found to be closer to clusters at low redshift, whatever the galaxy type. Passive galaxies in filaments are closer to clusters than star-forming galaxies in the low redshift bin only. The passive fraction of galaxies decreases with increasing clustercentric distance up to d{\textasciitilde}5 {cMpc}. Galaxy groups/clusters that are not located at nodes of our reconstruction are mainly found inside cosmic filaments. These results give clues for "pre-processing" in cosmic filaments, that could be due to smaller galaxy groups. This trend could be further explored by applying this method to larger photometric surveys such as {HSC}-{SPP} or Euclid.},

The fractional polarization at \$53{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}rm\{m\}\$ \$(154{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}rm\{m\})\$ ranges from 7\% (3\%) off nucleus to 0.5\% (0.3\%) near the nucleus.

	title = {A Dynamical Model for Clustered Star Formation in the Galactic Disk},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10719},
	abstract = {The clustered nature of star formation should produce a high degree of structure in the combined phase and chemical space in the Galactic disk. To date, observed structure of this kind has been mostly limited to bound clusters and moving groups. In this paper we present a new dynamical model of the Galactic disk that takes into account the clustered nature of star formation. This model predicts that the combined phase and chemical space is rich in substructure, and that this structure is sensitive to both the precise nature of clustered star formation and the large-scale properties of the Galaxy. The model self-consistently evolves 4 billion stars over the last 5 Gyr in a realistic potential that includes an axisymmetric component, a bar, spiral arms, and giant molecular clouds ({GMCs}). All stars are born in clusters with an observationally-motivated range of initial conditions. As direct {\textbackslash}textit\{N\}-body calculations for billions of stars is computationally infeasible, we have developed a method of initializing star cluster particles to mimic the effects of direct {\textbackslash}textit\{N\}-body effects, while the actual orbit integrations are treated as test particles within the analytic potential. We demonstrate that the combination of chemical and phase space information is much more effective at identifying truly co-natal populations than either chemical or phase space alone. Furthermore, we show that co-moving pairs of stars are very likely to be co-natal if their velocity separation is \${\textless} 2\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and their metallicity separation is \${\textless} 0.05\$ dex. The results presented here bode well for harnessing the synergies between {\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\} and spectroscopic surveys to reveal the assembly history of the Galactic disk.},

	abstract = {We explore the scaling between the size of star-forming clumps and rotational support in massively star-forming galactic disks. The analysis relies on simulations of a clumpy galaxy at \$z=2\$ and the observed {DYNAMO} sample of rare clumpy analogs at \$z{\textbackslash}approx0.1\$ to test a predictive clump size scaling proposed by {\textbackslash}citet\{Fisher2017ApJ...839L...5F\} in the context of the Violent Disk Instability ({VDI}) theory. We here determine the clump sizes using a recently presented 2-point estimator, which is robust against resolution/noise effects, hierarchical clump substructure, clump-clump overlap and other galactic substructure. After verifying Fisher's clump scaling relation for the {DYNAMO} observations, we explore whether this relation remains characteristic of the {VDI} theory, even if realistic physical processes, such as local asymetries and stellar feedback, are included in the model. To this end, we rely on hydrodynamic zoom-simulations of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with four different feedback prescriptions. We find that, during its marginally stable epoch at \$z=2\$, this mock galaxy falls on the clump scaling relation, although its position on this relation depends on the feedback model. This finding implies that Toomre-like stability considerations approximately apply to large (\${\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}rm kpc\$) instabilities in marginally stable turbulent disks, irrespective of the feedback model, but also emphasizes that the global clump distribution of a turbulent disk depends strongly on feedback.},

Motivated by observations of the universe's most massive galaxies, we compare those pressure measurements with models predicting the critical pressure at which cooler clouds start to precipitate out of the hot atmosphere and rain toward the center.

From our full sample of 130 metal-bearing absorbers, we infer that halo gas is kinematically complex when viewed in singly, doubly, and triply ionized species. Broad {OVI} and {CIV} absorbers are detected at similar velocities to the lower-ionization gas but with very different kinematic structure indicating that the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) is multi-phase. There is a high covering fraction of metal-bearing gas within 100 kpc including highly ionized gas such as {OVI}; however, observations of a single galaxy probed by a lensed background {QSO} suggest the size of metal-bearing clouds is small ({\textless}400 pc for all but the {OVI}-bearing gas). The mass in metals found within the halo is substantial, equivalent to \${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$ 25\% of the metal mass within the interstellar medium. The gas kinematics unambiguously show that 70\% of galaxies with detected metal absorption have some unbound metal-enriched gas, suggesting galactic winds may commonly eject gas from halos at \$z{\textbackslash}sim2\$. Significant thermal broadening is detected in {CGM} absorbers which dominates the internal energy of the gas. 40\% of the detected gas has temperatures in the range \$10{\textasciicircum}\{4.5-5.5\}\$ K where cooling times are short, suggesting the {CGM} is dynamic, with constant heating and/or cooling to produce this short-lived thermal phase.},

We post-process our simulations with a three-dimensional Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer code to study dust extinction, dust emission, and dust temperature within these simulated z{\textgreater}=5 galaxies. Our sample forms a tight correlation between infrared excess ({IRX}=F\_IR/F\_UV) and ultraviolet ({UV})-continuum slope (beta\_UV), despite the patchy, clumpy dust geometry shown in our simulations. We find that the {IRX}-beta\_UV relation is mainly determined by the shape of the extinction curve and is independent of its normalization (set by the dust-to-gas ratio). The bolometric {IR} luminosity (L\_IR) correlates with the intrinsic {UV} luminosity and the star formation rate ({SFR}) averaged over the past 10 Myr. We predict that at a given L\_IR, the peak wavelength of the dust spectral energy distributions for z{\textgreater}=5 galaxies is smaller by a factor of 2 (due to higher dust temperatures on average) than at z=0. The higher dust temperatures are driven by higher specific {SFRs} and {SFR} surface densities with increasing redshift. We derive the galaxy {UV} luminosity functions ({LFs}) at z=5-10 from our simulations and confirm that a heavy attenuation is required to reproduce the observed bright-end {UVLFs}.

This process imprints alignments between galaxy spins and nearby filaments and sheets. Low mass halos grow by accretion onto filaments, aligning their spins with the filaments, whereas high mass halos grow by mergers along filaments, generating spins perpendicular to the filament. We search for this alignment signal using filaments identified with the "Cosmic Web Reconstruction" algorithm applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Main Galaxy Sample and galaxy spins from the {MaNGA} integral-field unit survey. {MaNGA} produces a map of the galaxy's rotational velocity, allowing direct measurement of the galaxy's spin direction, or unit angular momentum vector projected onto the sky. We find no evidence for alignment between galaxy spins and filament directions. We do find hints of a mass-dependent alignment signal, which is in 2-3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ tension with the mass-dependent alignment signal in the {MassiveBlack}-{II} and Illustris hydrodynamical simulations. However, the tension vanishes when galaxy spin is measured using the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission line velocity rather than stellar velocity. Finally, in simulations we find that the mass-dependent transition from aligned to anti-aligned dark matter halo spins is not necessarily present in stellar spins: we find a stellar spin transition in Illustris but not in {MassiveBlack}-{II}, highlighting the sensitivity of spin-filament alignments to feedback prescriptions and subgrid physics.},

	abstract = {We use spherically symmetric hydrodynamic simulations to study the dynamical evolution and internal structure of superbubbles ({SBs}) driven by clustered supernovae ({SNe}), focusing on the effects of thermal conduction and cooling in the interface between the hot bubble interior and cooled shell. Our simulations employ an effective diffusivity to account for turbulent mixing from nonlinear instabilities that are not captured in 1D. The conductive heat flux into the shell is balanced by a combination of cooling in the interface and evaporation of shell gas into the bubble interior. This evaporation increases the density, and decreases the temperature, of the {SB} interior by more than an order of magnitude relative to simulations without conduction. However, most of the energy conducted into the interface is immediately lost to cooling, reducing the evaporative mass flux required to balance conduction. As a result, the evaporation rate is typically a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim\$3-30 lower than predicted by the classical similarity solution of Weaver et al., which neglects cooling. Blast waves from the first \${\textbackslash}sim\$30 {SNe} remain supersonic until colliding with the shell because reduced evaporation from the interface lowers the mass they sweep up in the hot interior. Updating the Weaver solution to include cooling, we construct a new analytic model to predict the cooling rate, evaporation rate, and temporal evolution of {SBs}. The cooling rate, and hence the hot gas mass and momentum delivered by {SBs}, is set by the ambient {ISM} density and the efficiency of nonlinear mixing at the bubble/shell interface.},

The galaxies sample {SFRs} from the main sequence ({MS}) to 50 times above the {MS}. The derived {ISM} masses are used to determine the dependence of gas mass on redshift, M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm *\}\$, and specific {SFR} ({sSFR}) relative to the {MS}. The {ISM} masses increase approximately 0.63 power of the rate of increase in {SFRs} with redshift and the 0.32 power of the {sSFR}/{sSFR}\$\_MS\$. The {SF} efficiencies also increase as the 0.36 power of the {SFR} redshift evolutionary and the 0.7 power of the elevation above the {MS}; thus the increased activities at early epochs are driven by both increased {ISM} masses and {SF} efficiency. Using the derived {ISM} mass function we estimate the accretion rates of gas required to maintain continuity of the {MS} evolution (\${\textgreater}100\$ {\textbackslash}msun yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at z \${\textgreater}\$ 2.5). Simple power-law dependences are similarly derived for the gas accretion rates. We argue that the overall evolution of galaxies is driven by the rates of gas accretion. The cosmic evolution of total {ISM} mass is estimated and linked to the evolution of {SF} and {AGN} activity at early epochs.},

	abstract = {Following Cui et al. 2018 (hereafter Paper I) on the classification of large-scale environments ({LSE}) at z = 0, we push our analysis to higher redshifts and study the evolution of {LSE} and the baryon distributions in them. Our aim is to investigate how baryons affect the {LSE} as a function of redshift. In agreement with Paper I, the baryon models have negligible effect on the {LSE} over all investigated redshifts. We further validate the conclusion obtained in Paper I that the gas web is an unbiased tracer of total matter -- even better at high redshifts. By separating the gas mainly by temperature, we find that about 40 per cent of gas is in the so-called warm-hot intergalactic medium ({WHIM}). This fraction of gas mass in the {WHIM} decreases with redshift, especially from z = 1 (29 per cent) to z = 2.1 (10 per cent). By separating the whole {WHIM} gas mass into the four large-scale environments (i.e. voids, sheets, filaments, and knots), we find that about half of the {WHIM} gas is located in filaments. Although the total gas mass in {WHIM} decreases with redshift, the {WHIM} mass fractions in the different {LSE} seem unchanged.},

These targets were selected to have known ionized outflows based on broad [{OIII}] emission-line components ({FWHM}{\textasciitilde}800-1800 km/s). Although `radio-quiet' and not `radio {AGN}' by many traditional criteria, we show that for nine of the targets, star formation likely accounts for {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10 per cent of the radio emission. We find that {\textasciitilde}80-90 per cent of these nine targets exhibit extended radio structures on 1-25 kpc scales. The quasars' radio morphologies, spectral indices and position on the radio size-luminosity relationship reveals that these sources are consistent with being low power compact radio galaxies. Therefore, we favour radio jets as dominating the radio emission in the majority of these quasars. The radio jets we observe are associated with morphologically and kinematically distinct features in the ionized gas, such as increased turbulence and outflowing bubbles, revealing jet-gas interaction on galactic scales. Importantly, such conclusions could not have been drawn from current low-resolution radio surveys such as {FIRST}. Our observations support a scenario where compact radio jets, with modest radio luminosities, are a crucial feedback mechanism for massive galaxies during a quasar phase.},

Using spatially resolved data, we investigate the ionized gas kinematics and photoionization properties in comparison with {AGNs} with strong outflows. We find significant differences between the kinematics of ionized gas and stars for two {AGNs}, which indicates the presence of {AGN}-driven outflows. Nevertheless, the low velocity and velocity dispersion of ionized gas indicate relatively weak outflows in these {AGNs}. Our results highlight the importance of spatially-resolved observation in investigating gas kinematics and identifying the signatures of {AGN}-driven outflows. While it is unclear what determines the occurrence of outflows, we discuss the conditions and detectability of {AGN}-driven outflows based on a larger sample of {AGNs} with and without outflows, suggesting the importance of gas content in the host galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present the new {TNG}50 cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical simulation -- the third and final volume of the {IllustrisTNG} project. This simulation occupies a unique combination of large volume and high resolution, with a 50 Mpc box sampled by 2160{\textasciicircum}3 gas cells (baryon mass of 8x10{\textasciicircum}4 solar masses). The median spatial resolution of star-forming {ISM} gas is {\textasciitilde}100-140 parsecs (from z=0 to z=6). This resolution approaches or exceeds that of modern 'zoom' simulations of individual massive galaxies, while the volume contains {\textasciitilde}20,000 resolved galaxies with M* {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}7 solar masses. Herein we show first results from {TNG}50, focusing on galactic outflows driven by supernovae as well as supermassive black hole feedback. We find that the outflow mass loading is a non-monotonic function of galaxy stellar mass, turning over and rising rapidly above 10{\textasciicircum}10.5 solar masses due to the action of the central black hole ({BH}). Outflow velocity increases with stellar mass, and at fixed stellar mass, outflows are faster at higher redshift. The phase structure of galactic winds is complex, and we demonstrate that the {TNG} model can produce high velocity, multi-phase outflows which include cool, dense components. These outflows reach speeds in excess of 3000 km/s with an ejective, {BH}-driven origin. Critically, we show how the relative simplicity of model inputs (and scalings) at the injection scale produces complex behavior at galactic and halo scales. For example, despite isotropic wind launching, outflows exhibit natural collimation and an emergent bipolarity. We present a correlation between outflow velocity and offset from the star-forming main sequence -- galaxies above the {SFMS} drive faster outflows, although this correlation inverts at high mass with the onset of quenching, whereby low luminosity, slowly accreting, massive black holes drive the strongest outflows.},

	abstract = {Observational evidence revealing the main mechanisms that accelerate quasar outflows has proven difficult to obtain due to the complexity of the absorption features that this gas produces in the spectra of the emission sources. We build 36 composite outflow spectra, covering a large range of outflow and quasar parameters, by stacking broad (\${\textgreater}450{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm km{\textbackslash},s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$) absorption line ({BAL}) systems in the spectra of {SDSS}-{III}/{BOSS} {DR}12 quasars. The two lines of the atomic doublet of {CIV}, with a separation of \${\textbackslash}approx 497{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm km{\textbackslash},s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$, as well as those of other species appear well resolved in all the composites. This is in agreement with broad outflow troughs consisting in the superposition of many narrow absorbers. We also report on the ubiquitous detection of the radiative-acceleration signature known as line locking in all the composite outflow spectra. Line locking is driven by the {CIV} atomic doublet and is visible on the blue side of all the strong absorption transitions. Similar effects from the doublets of {OVI}, {SiIV}, or {NV}, however, are not detected. Our results confirm that radiation pressure is a prevalent mechanism for accelerating outflows in quasars and possibly other environments, and the contribution from only certain species may give insight into the structure of the outflowing gas.},

The quenched fraction increases modestly at {ICM} densities below a threshold before increasing sharply beyond this threshold toward the cluster center. We show that this increase in quenched fraction at high {ICM} density is well matched by a simple, analytic model of ram pressure stripping. These results are consistent with a picture where low-mass cluster galaxies experience an initial, slow-quenching mode driven by steady gas depletion, followed by rapid quenching associated with ram pressure of cold-gas stripping near (one quarter of the virial radius, on average) the cluster center.},

	abstract = {We present new cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that incorporate Dark Matter Annihilation Feedback ({DMAF}), whereby energy released from the annihilation of dark matter particles through decay channels such as photon or positron-electron pairs provide additional heating sources for local baryonic material. For annihilation rates comparable to {WIMP}-like particles, we find that the key influence of {DMAF} is to inhibit gas accretion onto halos. Such diminished gas accretion early in the lifetimes of halos results in reduced gas fractions in smaller halos, and the delayed halo formation times of larger structures, suggesting that {DMAF} could impact the stellar age distribution in galaxies, and morphology of dwarfs. For a dark matter particle mass of \$m\_{\textbackslash}chi{\textbackslash}sim10\${\textasciitilde}{MeV}, there is a `critical halo mass' of \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at \$z=0\$, below which there are large differences when compared to \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM}, such as a reduction in the abundance of halo structures as large as 25 percent, reduced gas content by 50 percent and central gas densities reduced down to 10 percent within halos of mass \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ but with increasing effects in smaller halos.

We split the {ISM} into four regimes: hot, warm, cool and cold-dense, motivated by the hot, ionised, atomic and molecular gas phases observed in real galaxies. We find that, on average, interactions enhance the star formation rate of the pair ({\textasciitilde}30\%, merger-suite sample average) and elevate their cold-dense gas content ({\textasciitilde}18\%). This is accompanied by a decrease in warm gas ({\textasciitilde}11\%), a negligible change in cool gas ({\textasciitilde}4\% increase), and a substantial increase in hot gas ({\textasciitilde}400\%).

We present a new merit function that improves the distinction between primary and secondary progenitors, reducing tree pathologies.

Confirming previous results, we find that the galaxy-absorber pairs of the {MEGAFLOW} survey follow a strong bimodal distribution, consistent with a picture of {MgII} absorption being predominantly present in outflow cones and extended disk-like structures. This allows us to select a bona-fide sample of galaxy-absorber pairs probing these disks for impact parameters of 10-70 kpc. We test the hypothesis that the disk-like gas is co-rotating with the galaxy disks, and find that for 7 out of 9 pairs the absorption velocity shares the sign of the disk velocity, disfavouring random orbits.

Two quantities, a position angle and an axis ratio, describe the projected shape of each galactic disk on the sky, leaving an ambiguity about which side of the minor axis is tipped toward the observer. This degeneracy regarding the 3D orientation of disks has compromised previous efforts to measure gas inflow speeds. We present {HST} and Keck/{LGSAO} imaging that resolves spiral structure in redshift \$z{\textbackslash}approx0.2\$ galaxies. We then determine the sign of the disk inclination, under the assumption that the spiral arms trail the rotation. Using the measured rotation curve, we then model the projection of both radial infall in the disk plane and circular orbits onto each quasar sightline. We compare the resulting line-of-sight velocities to the observed velocity range of Mg {II} absorption in quasar spectra. We find maximum radial inflow speeds of 30-40 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in two sightlines. We also rule out a velocity component from radial inflow in one sightline, suggesting that the structures feeding gas to these disks do not have unity covering factor (even within 30\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ of the major axis and low impact parameters). We recommend appropriate selection criteria for building larger samples of galaxy -- quasar pairs that produce orientations sensitive to constraining inflow properties.},

	abstract = {The precise localization ({\textless}1'') of multiple fast radio bursts ({FRBs}) to z{\textgreater}0.1 galaxies has confirmed that the dispersion measures ({DMs}) of these enigmatic sources afford a new opportunity to probe the diffuse ionized gas around and in between galaxies. In this manuscript, we examine the signatures of gas in dark matter halos (aka halo gas) on {DM} observations in current and forthcoming {FRB} surveys. Combining constraints from observations of the high velocity clouds, {OVII} absorption, and the {DM} to the Large Magellanic Cloud with hydrostatic models of halo gas, we estimate that our Galactic halo will contribute \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {DM}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {MW},halo\} {\textbackslash}approx 50-80 {\textbackslash}rm pc/cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ from the Sun to 200 kpc independent of any contribution from the Galactic {ISM}. Extending analysis to the Local Group, we demonstrate that M31's halo will be easily detected by high-sample {FRB} surveys (e.g. {CHIME}) although signatures from a putative Local Group medium may compete. We then review current empirical constraints on halo gas in distant galaxies and discuss the implications for their {DM} contributions. We further examine the {DM} probability distribution function of a population of {FRBs} at z {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 0 using an updated halo mass function and new models for the halo density profile. Lastly, we illustrate the potential of {FRB} experiments for resolving the baryonic fraction of halos by analyzing simulated sightlines through the {CASBaH} survey.

	abstract = {We use state-of-the-art cosmological zoom simulations to explore the distribution of neutral gas in and around galaxies that gives rise to high column density {\textbackslash}ion\{H\}\{i\} {\textbackslash}mbox\{Ly-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$\} absorption (formally, sub-{DLAs} and {DLAs}) in the spectra of background quasars. Previous cosmological hydrodynamic simulations under-predict the mean projected separations \$(b)\$ of these absorbers relative to the host, and invoke selection effects to bridge the gap with observations. On the other hand, single lines of sight ({LOS}) in absorption cannot uniquely constrain the galactic origin. Our simulations match all observational data, with {DLA} and sub-{DLA} {LOS} existing over the entire probed parameter space (\$-4{\textbackslash}lesssim \$[M/H]\${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.5\$, \$b{\textless}50\$ kpc) at all redshifts (\$z{\textbackslash}sim 0.4 - 3.0\$). We demonstrate how the existence of {DLA} {LOS} at \$b{\textbackslash}gtrsim 20-30\$ kpc from a massive host galaxy require high numerical resolution, and that these {LOS} are associated with dwarf satellites in the main halo, stripped metal-rich gas and outflows. Separating the galaxy into interstellar ("{\textbackslash}ion\{H\}\{i\} disc") and circumgalactic ("halo") components, we find that both components significantly contribute to damped {\textbackslash}ion\{H\}\{i\} absorption {LOS}. Above the sub-{DLA} ({DLA}) limits, the disc and halo contribute with \${\textbackslash}sim 60 (80)\$ and \${\textbackslash}sim 40 (20)\$ per cent, respectively. Our simulations confirm analytical model-predictions of the {DLA}-distribution at \$z{\textbackslash}lesssim 1\$. At high redshift (\$z{\textbackslash}sim 2-3\$) sub-{DLA} and {DLAs} occupy similar spatial scales, but on average separate by a factor of two by \$z{\textbackslash}sim 0.5\$. On whether sub-{DLA} and {DLA} {LOS} sample different stellar-mass galaxies, such a correlation can be driven by a differential covering-fraction of sub-{DLA} to {DLA} {LOS} with stellar mass. This preferentially selects sub-{DLA} {LOS} in more massive galaxies in the low-\$z\$ universe.},

	abstract = {Asymptotic Giant Branch ({AGB}) winds from evolved stars not only provide a non-trivial amount of mass and energy return, but also produce dust grains in massive elliptical galaxies. Due to the fast stellar velocity and the high ambient temperature, the wind is thought to form a comet-like tail, similar to Mira in the Local Bubble. Many massive elliptical galaxies and cluster central galaxies host extended dusty cold filaments. The fate of the cold dusty stellar wind and its relation to cold filaments are not well understood. In this work, we carry out both analytical and numerical studies of the interaction between an {AGB} wind and the surrounding hot gas. We find that the cooling time of the tail is inversely proportional to the ambient pressure. In the absence of cooling, or in low pressure environments (e.g., the outskirts of elliptical galaxies), {AGB} winds are quickly mixed into the hot gas, and all the {AGB} winds have similar appearance and head-to-tail ratio. In high pressure environments, such as the Local Bubble and the central regions of massive elliptical galaxies, some of the gas in the mixing layer between the stellar wind and the surrounding hot gas can cool efficiently and cause the tail to become longer. Our simulated tail of Mira itself has similar length and velocity to that observed, and appears similar to the simulated {AGB} tail in the central regions of massive galaxies. We speculate that instead of thermal instability, the induced condensation at the mixing layer of {AGB} winds may be the origin of cold filaments in massive galaxies and galaxy clusters. This naturally explains the existence of dust and {PAH} in the filaments.},

	abstract = {We present observations of 50 pairs of redshift z {\textasciitilde} 0.2 star-forming galaxies and background quasars. These sightlines probe the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) out to half the virial radius, and we describe the circumgalactic gas kinematics relative to the reference frame defined by the galactic disks. We detect halo gas in {MgII} absorption, measure the equivalent-width-weighted Doppler shifts relative to each galaxy, and find that the {CGM} has a component of angular momentum that is aligned with the galactic disk. No net counter-rotation of the {CGM} is detected within 45 degrees of the major axis at any impact parameter. The velocity offset of the circumgalactic gas correlates with the projected rotation speed in the disk plane out to disk radii of roughly 70 kpc. We confirm previous claims that the {MgII} absorption becomes stronger near the galactic minor axis and show that the equivalent width correlates with the velocity range of the absorption. We cannot directly measure the location of any absorber along the sightline, but we explore the hypothesis that individual velocity components can be associated with gas orbiting in the disk plane or flowing radially outward in a conical outflow. We conclude that centrifugal forces partially support the low-ionization gas and galactic outflows kinematically disturb the {CGM} producing excess absorption. Our results firmly rule out schema for the inner {CGM} that lack rotation and suggest that angular momentum as well as galactic winds should be included in any viable model for the low-redshift {CGM}.},

	abstract = {Properties of galaxies vary systematically with the mass of their parent dark matter halos. This basic galaxy - halo connection shows a fair amount of scatter whose origin is not fully understood. Here, we study how differences in the halo assembly history affect central galaxies in low mass (M\_halo {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}12 M\_sun) halos at z=2-6 with the help of the {MassiveFIRE} suite of cosmological simulations. In contrast to previous works that tie galaxy properties to halo concentration and halo formation redshift, we focus on halo growth rate as a measure of assembly history. We find that, at fixed halo mass, faster growing halos tend to have lower stellar masses and higher {SFRs} per unit stellar mass but similar overall {SFRs}. We provide a simple explanation for these findings with the help of an analytic model that captures approximately the behavior of our hydrodynamical simulations. Specifically, among halos of a given current mass, quickly growing halos have lower stellar masses (and thus higher {sSFRs}) because they were less massive and had comparably lower cold gas masses and {SFRs} in the past than slowly growing halos. By combining these findings with estimates for the scatter of the halo growth rate, we show that variations in growth rate at fixed halo mass may largely explain the scatter of the stellar mass - halo mass relation. In contrast, halo growth variations likely play only a minor role in the scatter of the star forming sequence in low mass galaxies.},

To characterize the spatial coherence of this absorption, we analyze the W\_2796 distribution in the {CGM} of 27 star-forming galaxies detected in deep spectroscopy of bright background (b/g) galaxies first presented in Rubin et al. (2018). The sample foreground (f/g) systems have redshifts 0.35{\textless}z{\textless}0.8 and stellar masses 9.1{\textless}log M\_*/M\_sun{\textless}11.1, and the b/g galaxies provide spatially-extended probes with half-light radii 1.0 kpc{\textless}R\_eff{\textless}7.9 kpc at projected distances R\_perp{\textless}50 kpc. Our analysis also draws on literature W\_2796 values measured in b/g {QSO} spectroscopy probing the halos of f/g galaxies with a similar range in M\_* at z {\textasciitilde} 0.25. By making the assumptions that (1) samples of like galaxies exhibit similar circumgalactic W\_2796 distributions; and that (2) the quantity log W\_2796 has a Gaussian distribution with a dispersion that is constant with M\_* and R\_perp, we use this {QSO}-galaxy pair sample to construct a model for the log W\_2796 distribution in the {CGM}. We then demonstrate the dependence of this distribution on the ratio of the surface area of the b/g probe to the projected absorber surface area (x\_A=A\_G/A\_A), finding that distributions which assume x\_A{\textgreater}=15 are statistically inconsistent with that observed toward our b/g galaxies at a 95\% confidence level. This limit, in combination with the b/g galaxy sizes, requires that the length scale over which W\_2796 does not vary (the "coherence scale" of {MgII} absorption) is l\_A{\textgreater}1.9 kpc. This novel constraint on the morphology of cool, photoionized structures in the inner {CGM} suggests that either these structures each extend over kiloparsec scales, or that the numbers and velocity dispersion of these structures are spatially correlated over the same scales.},

	abstract = {The abundance and demographics of dark matter substructure is important for many areas in astrophysics and cosmological \$N\$-body simulations have been the primary tool used to investigate them. However, it has recently become clear that the simulations are subject to numerical artefacts, which hampers a proper treatment of the tidal evolution of subhaloes. Unfortunately, no analytical models that accurately describe subhalo evolution exist either. We therefore present a library of idealized, high resolution \$N\$-body simulations of the tidal evolution of individual subhaloes that can be used to calibrate semi-analytical models and to complement cosmological simulations. The simulations focus on minor mergers, i.e., the mass of the subhalo is much smaller than that of the host halo, such that the impact of dynamical friction is negligible. This setup allows the adoption of a fixed analytical potential for modelling the host halo. The dynamical evolution of subhaloes is followed with \$N\$-body computations. In the library, four parameters, two of which characterize the subhalo orbit with respect to the host halo, and the two concentrations of the host- and subhalo, are varied over the ranges encountered in cosmological simulations. We show several representative examples from the library that illustrate the evolution of the subhalo mass and velocity dispersion profiles. Additionally, we make publicly available a pre-trained non-parametric model of the subhalo mass evolution based on random forest regression. This model is able to interpolate the simulation data at the 0.1{\textbackslash},dex level and provides efficient access to the data for further use in modelling.},

If the abundance breaks are genuine, the metallicity gradient of this galaxy follows a steep-shallow-steep trend, a scenario predicted by three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations of disc galaxies. The first break is located near the corotation radius. This first steep gradient may have originated by recent star formation episodes and a relatively young bar (\${\textless}\$1 Gyr). In the numerical simulations the shallow gradient is created by the effects of dilution by outflow where low-metallicity material is mixed with enriched gas.

Photoionization models indicate that the nitrogen-to-silicon relative abundance is solar, yet magnesium is underabundant by a factor of \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 2. We also report spatially-resolved emission-line spectroscopy of the nearby galaxy, and we extract its rotation curve. The galaxy's metallicity is \${\textbackslash}approx 8 {\textbackslash}times\$ higher than [N/H] in the absorber, and interestingly, the absorber velocities suggest that the gas at \${\textbackslash}rho =\$ 66 kpc is corotating with the galaxy's stellar disk, possibly with an inflow component. These characteristics could indicate that this sub-{DLA} system arises in a "cold-accretion" flow. However, the absorber abundance patterns are peculiar. We hypothesize that the gas was ejected from its galaxy of origin (or, perhaps is a result of tidal debris from interactions between the group galaxies) with a solar nitrogen abundance, but that subsequently mixed with (and was diluted by) gas in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) or group. If the gas is bound to the nearby galaxy, this system may be an example of the gas "recycling" predicted by theoretical galaxy simulations. Our hypothesis is testable with future observations.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06924},
	abstract = {Recent observations suggest that dense gas clouds can survive even in hot galactic winds. Here we show that the inclusion of turbulent densities with different statistical properties has significant effects on the evolution of wind-swept clouds. We investigate how the initial standard deviation of the log-normal density field influences the dynamics of quasi-isothermal clouds embedded in supersonic winds. We compare uniform, fractal solenoidal, and fractal compressive cloud models in both 3D and 2D hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the processes of cloud disruption and dense gas entrainment are functions of the initial density distribution in the cloud. Fractal clouds accelerate, mix, and are disrupted earlier than uniform clouds. Within the fractal cloud sample, compressive clouds retain high-density nuclei, so they are more confined, less accelerated, and have lower velocity dispersions than their solenoidal counterparts. Compressive clouds are also less prone to Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, so they survive longer than solenoidal clouds. By comparing the cloud properties at the destruction time, we find that dense gas entrainment is more effective in uniform clouds than in either of the fractal clouds, and it is more effective in solenoidal than in compressive models. In contrast, mass loading into the wind is more efficient in compressive cloud models than in uniform or solenoidal models. Overall, wide density distributions lead to inefficient entrainment, but they facilitate mass loading and favour the survival of very dense gas in hot galactic winds.},

The 101-orbit program is comprised of {COS} and {STIS} spectroscopy toward 33 {LMC} massive stars between 1150 A and 3180 A, and parallel {WFC}3 imaging in 7 {NUV}-{NIR} filters. The fraction of silicon in the gas-phase (depletion) obtained from the spectroscopy decreases with increasing hydrogen column density. Depletion patterns for silicon differ between the Milky Way, {LMC}, and {SMC}, with the silicon depletion level offsetting almost exactly the metallicity differences, leading to constant gas-phase abundances in those galaxies for a given hydrogen column density. The silicon depletion correlates linearly with the absolute-to-selective extinction, R\$\_V\$, indicating a link between gas depletion and dust grain size. Extinction maps are derived from the resolved stellar photometry in the parallel imaging, which can be compared to {FIR} images from Herschel and Spitzer to estimate the emissivity of dust at {LMC} metallicity. The full {METAL} sample of depletions, {UV} extinction curves, and extinction maps will inform the abundance, size, composition, and optical properties of dust grains in the {LMC}, comprehensively improve our understanding of dust properties, and the accuracy with which dust-based gas masses, star formation rates and histories in nearby and high-redshift galaxies are estimated.

Here we compare high- and low-ionization absorption within 69 intervening systems at \$z{\textgreater}5\$, including 16 systems at \$z{\textgreater}6\$, from Magellan/{FIRE} spectra of 47 quasars together with a Keck/{HIRES} spectrum of the `ultraluminous' \$z=6.3\$ quasar {SDSSJ}010013.02+280225.8. The highest redshift absorbers increasingly exhibit low-ionization species alone, consistent with previous single-ion surveys that show the frequency of Mg {II} is unchanging with redshift while C {IV} absorption drops markedly toward \$z=6\$. We detect no C {IV} or Si {IV} in half of all metal-line absorbers at \$z{\textgreater}5.7\$, with stacks not revealing any slightly weaker C {IV} just below our detection threshold, and most of the other half have \$N\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{CII}\}{\textgreater}N\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{CIV}\}\$. In contrast, only 20{\textbackslash}\% of absorbers at 5.0--5.7 lack high-ionization gas, and a search of 25 {HIRES} sightlines at \$z{\textbackslash}sim3\$ yielded zero such examples. We infer these low-ionization high-redshift absorption systems may be analogous to metal-poor Damped Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ systems (\${\textbackslash}sim1{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the absorber population at \$z{\textbackslash}sim3\$), based on incidence rates and absolute and relative column densities.

At \${\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash},1.5-2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{200\}\}\$ of the cluster dark matter halo, we find an extremely steep decline in the halo gas content of infalling haloes and subhaloes irrespective of cluster mass, possibly indicating the presence of an accretion shock. We also find that subhaloes are particularly gas-poor, even in the cluster outskirts, which could indicate active regions of ongoing pre-processing. By modelling the instantaneous ram pressure experienced by each halo and subhalo at \$z=0\$, we show that the ram pressure intensity is also well correlated with phase-space position, which is again irrespective of cluster mass. In fact, we show that regions in the phase-space plane with high differential velocity between a halo or subhalo and its local gas environment, are almost mutually exclusive with high halo gas content regions. This suggests a causal link between the gas content of objects and the instantaneous ram pressure they experience, where the dominant factor is the differential velocity.},

	abstract = {Recent studies of galaxies in the local Universe, including those in the Local Group, find that the efficiency of environmental (or satellite) quenching increases dramatically at satellite stellar masses below {\textasciitilde} \$10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. This suggests a physical scale where quenching transitions from a slow "starvation" mode to a rapid "stripping" mode at low masses. We investigate the plausibility of this scenario using observed {HI} surface density profiles for a sample of 66 nearby galaxies as inputs to analytic calculations of ram-pressure and viscous stripping. Across a broad range of host properties, we find that stripping becomes increasingly effective at \$M\_\{*\} {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{8-9\}{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, reproducing the critical mass scale observed. However, for canonical values of the circumgalactic medium density (\$n\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\} {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3.5\}\$ \$\{{\textbackslash}rm cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$), we find that stripping is not fully effective; infalling satellites are, on average, stripped of {\textless} 40 - 70\% of their cold gas reservoir, which is insufficient to match observations. By including a host halo gas distribution that is clumpy and therefore contains regions of higher density, we are able to reproduce the observed {HI} gas fractions (and thus the high quenched fraction and short quenching timescale) of Local Group satellites, suggesting that a host halo with clumpy gas may be crucial for quenching low-mass systems in Local Group-like (and more massive) host halos.},

	abstract = {We explore the radial variation of star formation histories in dwarf galaxies simulated with Feedback In Realistic Environments ({FIRE}) physics. The sample contains 9 low-mass field dwarfs with M\_ star = 10{\textasciicircum}5 - 10{\textasciicircum}7 M\_sun from previous {FIRE} results, and a new suite of 17 higher mass field dwarfs with M\_star = 10{\textasciicircum}7 - 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_sun introduced here. We find that age gradients are common in our dwarfs, with older stars dominant at large radii. The strength of the gradient correlates with overall galaxy age such that earlier star formation produces a more pronounced gradient. The relation between formation time and strength of the gradient is driven by both mergers and star-formation feedback. Mergers can both steepen and flatten the age gradient depending on the timing of the merger and star formation history of the merging galaxy. In galaxies without significant mergers, early feedback pushes stars to the outskirts at early times. Interestingly, among galaxies without mergers, those with large dark matter cores have flatter age gradients because these galaxies have more late-time feedback. If real galaxies have age gradients as we predict, stellar population studies that rely on sampling a limited fraction of a galaxy can give a biased view of its global star formation history. We show that central fields can be biased young by a few Gyrs while outer fields are biased old. Fields positioned near the 2D half-light radius will provide the least biased measure of a dwarf galaxy's global star formation history.},

	abstract = {The interaction between inflowing gas clouds and galactic outflows at the interface where the galactic disk transitions into the circumgalactic medium is an important process in galaxy fueling, yet remains poorly understood. Using a series of tall-box hydrodynamic {ENZO} simulations, we have studied the interaction between smooth gas inflow and supernovae-driven outflow at the disk-halo interface with pc-scale resolution. A realistic wind of outflowing material is generated by supernovae explosions in the disk, while inflowing gas is injected at the top boundary of the simulation box with an injection velocity ranging from \$10-100 {\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash} km {\textbackslash} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. We find that cooling and hydrodynamic instabilities drive the injected gas to fragment into cold (\${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$ K) cloud clumps with typical densities of \${\textbackslash}sim 1 {\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash} cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$. These clumps initially accelerate before interacting and partially mixing with the outflow and decelerating to velocities in the 50-100 \${\textbackslash}rm km {\textbackslash} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ range. When the gas clumps hit the disk, \$10{\textbackslash}\%-50 {\textbackslash}\%\$ of the injected material is able to accrete (depending on the injection velocity). Clumps originating from gas injected with a higher initial velocity approach the disk with greater ram pressure, allowing them to penetrate through the disk in low density regions. We use (equilibrium) {CLOUDY} photoionization models to generate absorption and emission signatures of gas accretion, finding that our mock {HI} and H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ observables are prominent and generally consistent with measurements in the Milky Way.

	abstract = {The dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way Crater {II} and Antlia {II} have uncommonly low dynamical mass densities, due to their large size and low velocity dispersion. Previous work have failed to identify formation scenarios within the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} framework and have invoked cored dark matter haloes, processed by tides. I show that the tidal evolution of \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} {NFW} haloes is richer than previously recognised: tidal heating causes the innermost regions of haloes that fall short of the mass-concentration relation to expand significantly, resulting in the formation of giant, kinematically cold satellites like Crater {II} and Antlia {II}. Furthermore, while the satellite is reaching apocenter, extra-tidal material can cause an even more inflated appearance. When present, as likely for the larger Antlia {II}, nominally unbound material can be recognised thanks to its somewhat hotter kinematics and line-of-sight velocity gradient. Contrary to other formation scenarios, Crater {II} and Antlia {II} may well have experienced very little mass loss, as in fact hinted by their observed metallicity. If indeed a satellite of {NGC}1052, tidal evolution of a low-concentration halo may similarly have led to the formation of {NGC}1052-{DF}2.},

	abstract = {Galaxy halos appear to be missing a large fraction of their baryons, most probably hiding in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}), a diffuse component within the dark matter halo that extends far from the inner regions of the galaxies. A powerful tool to study the {CGM} gas is offered by absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars. Here, we present optical ({MUSE}) and mm ({ALMA}) observations of the field of the quasar Q1130-1449 which includes a log [N(H I)/cm{\textasciicircum}-2]=21.71+/-0.07 absorber at z=0.313. Ground-based {VLT}/{MUSE} 3D spectroscopy shows 11 galaxies at the redshift of the absorber down to a limiting {SFR}{\textgreater}0.01 M\_sun yr{\textasciicircum}-1 (covering emission lines of [{OII}], Hbeta, [{OIII}], [{NII}] and Halpha), 7 of which are new discoveries. In particular, we report a new emitter with a smaller impact parameter to the quasar line-of-sight (b=10.6 kpc) than the galaxies detected so far. Three of the objects are also detected in {CO}(1-0) in our {ALMA} observations indicating long depletion timescales for the molecular gas and kinematics consistent with the ionised gas. We infer from dedicated numerical cosmological {RAMSES} zoom-in simulations that the physical properties of these objects qualitatively resemble a small group environment, possibly part of a filamentary structure. Based on metallicity and velocity arguments, we conclude that the neutral gas traced in absorption is only partly related to these emitting galaxies while a larger fraction is likely the signature of gas with surface brightness almost four orders of magnitude fainter that current detection limits. Together, these findings challenge a picture where strong-{HI} quasar absorbers are associated with a single bright galaxy and favour a scenario where the {HI} gas probed in absorption is related to far more complex galaxy structures.},

We have selected high-resolution spectra toward 25 stars that contain a multitude of interstellar absorption lines associated with the interstellar medium ({ISM}) gas within these {PGCC} sources, including carbon monoxide ({CO}), C I and O I. By building cloud-component models of the individual absorption components present in these spectra, we can identify and isolate components associated with the {PGCC} sources, allowing for a more accurate investigation of the {ISM} behavior within these sources. Despite probing a broad range of overall sightline properties, we detect {CO} along each sightline.

We estimate the systematic errors in these quantities contributed by the allowed range of the quasar spectral index used in the ultraviolet background radiation calculations. Our inferred \$n\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}tiny H\}\$ and overdensity (\${\textbackslash}Delta\$) are much higher than the measurements available in the literature and favor the absorption originating from gas associated with circumgalactic medium and probably not in hydrostatic equilibrium. We also notice \$n\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}tiny H\}\$, \$L\$ and \$[C/H]\$ associated with C {III} components show statistically significant redshift evolution. To some extent, these redshift evolutions are driven by the appearance of compact, high \$n\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}tiny H\}\$ and high \$[C/H]\$ components only in the low\$-z\$ end. We find more than 5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ level correlation between \$[C/H]\$ and \$L\$, \$L\$ and neutral hydrogen column density (N ({HI})), N ({HI}) and \$[C/H]\$. We show \$L\$ versus \$[C/H]\$ correlation can be well reproduced if \$L\$ is governed by the product of gas cooling time and sound speed as expected in the case of cloud fragmentation under thermal instabilities. This allows us to explain other observed correlations by simple photoionization considerations. Studying the optically thin C {III} absorbers over a large \$z\$ range and probably correlating their \$z\$ evolution with global star formation rate density evolution can shed light into the physics of cold clump formation and their evolution in the circumgalactic medium.},

The two codes share the same Tree-{PM} gravity solver and include identical sub-resolution physics, but employ different methods to solve the equations of hydrodynamics. This allows us to assess the impact of hydro-solver uncertainties on the results of cosmological studies of galaxy formation. We focus on predictions for global baryon statistics, such as the cosmic star formation rate density, after we introduce our simulation suite and numerical methods. Properties of individual galaxies and haloes are examined by Keres et al. (2011), while a third paper by Sijacki et al. (2011) uses idealised simulations to analyse the differences between the hydrodynamical schemes. We find that the global baryon statistics differ significantly between the two simulation approaches. {AREPO} shows higher star formation rates at late times, lower mean temperatures, and different gas mass fractions in characteristic phases of the intergalactic medium, in particular a reduced amount of hot gas. Although both codes use the same implementation of cooling, more gas cools out of haloes in {AREPO} compared with {GADGET} towards low redshifts. We show that this is caused by a higher heating rate with {SPH} in the outer parts of haloes, owing to viscous dissipation of {SPH}'s inherent sonic velocity noise and {SPH}'s efficient damping of subsonic turbulence injected in the halo infall region, and because of a higher efficiency of gas stripping in {AREPO}. As a result of such differences, {AREPO} leads also to more disk-like morphologies compared to {GADGET}. Our results indicate that inaccuracies in hydrodynamic solvers can lead to comparatively large systematic differences.},

We combine new measurements of near-ultraviolet, low-ionization absorption lines with previously measured masses, luminosities, colors, and star formation rates to describe the demographics and properties of galactic flows. Among star-forming galaxies with blue colors, we find a net blueshift of the {FeII} absorption greater than 200 km/s (100 km/s) towards 2.5\% (20\%) of the galaxies. The fraction of blueshifted spectra does not vary significantly with stellar mass, color, or luminosity but does decline at specific star formation rates less than roughly 0.8 Gyr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}. The insensitivity of the blueshifted fraction to galaxy properties requires collimated outflows at these redshifts, while the decline in outflow fraction with increasing blueshift might reflect the angular dependence of the outflow velocity. The low detection rate of infalling gas, 3 to 6\% of the spectra, suggests an origin in (enriched) streams favorably aligned with our sightline. We find 4 of these 9 infalling streams have projected velocities commensurate with the kinematics of an extended disk or satellite galaxy. The strength of the {MgII} absorption increases with stellar mass, B-band luminosity, and U-B color, trends arising from a combination of more interstellar absorption at the systemic velocity and less emission filling in more massive galaxies.

In this model, the {CGM} consists of a diffuse coronal gas (\$T{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}6{\textbackslash},\$K) in pressure equilibrium with numerous \${\textbackslash}lesssim 1{\textbackslash},\$pc scale cool clumps or `cloudlets' formed by shattering in a cooling instability. The areal filling factor of the cloudlets is expected to exceed unity in \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ haloes, and the ensuing radio-wave scattering is akin to that caused by turbulence in the Galactic warm ionized medium ({WIM}). If \$30{\textbackslash},\$per-cent of cosmic baryons are in the {CGM}, we show that for a cool-gas volume fraction of \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm v\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, sources at \$z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}{\textbackslash}sim 1\$ suffer angular broadening by \${\textbackslash}sim 15{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu\$as and temporal broadening by \${\textbackslash}sim 1{\textbackslash},\$ms at \${\textbackslash}lambda = 30{\textbackslash},\$cm, due to scattering by the clumps in intervening {CGM}. The former prediction will be difficult to test (the angular broadening will suppress Galactic scintillation only for \${\textless}10{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu\$Jy compact synchrotron sources). However the latter prediction, of temporal broadening of localized fast radio bursts, can constrain the size and mass fraction of cool ionized gas clumps as function of halo mass and redshift, and thus provides a test of the model proposed by {McCourt} et al.(2018).},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03448},
	abstract = {We report the first {APOGEE} metallicities and alpha-abundances measured for 3800 red giant stars spanning a large radial range of both the Large ({LMC}) and Small Magellanic Clouds ({SMC}), the largest Milky Way dwarf galaxies. Our sample is an order of magnitude larger than that of previous studies and extends to much larger radial distances. These are the first results presented that make use of the newly installed southern {APOGEE} instrument at the du Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Our unbiased sample of the {LMC} spans a large range in metallicity from [Fe/H]=-0.2 to very metal poor stars of [Fe/H]=-2.5, the most metal-poor Magellanic Clouds ({MCs}) stars detected to date. The {LMC} [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution is very flat over a large metallicity range but rises by {\textasciitilde}0.1 dex at the metal-rich end. We interpret this as a sign of the known recent increase in {MC} star formation activity and are able to reproduce the pattern with a chemical evolution model that includes a recent "starburst". This starburst phase is required to reproduce the flat alpha-abundance distributions in both the {LMC} and {SMC}. At the metal-poor end, we capture the increase of [alpha/Fe] with decreasing [Fe/H] and constrain the "alpha-knee" to [Fe/H]=-2.2 in both {MCs} implying a low {SFE} of {\textasciitilde}0.01 Gyr{\textasciicircum}-1. Counter-intuitively, the knee is more metal-poor than that of less massive Milky Way ({MW}) dwarf galaxies such as Fornax or Sagittarius. One possible interpretation is that the {MCs} formed in a lower-density environment than the {MW}, a hypothesis that is consistent with the paradigm that the {MCs} fell into the {MW} potential only recently.},

	abstract = {We report new wide-field ({\textasciitilde} 4 x 4 square arcmin) {MUSE} observations of the Blue Infalling Group ({BIG}), a compact group of galaxies located at a projected distance of {\textasciitilde} 150 kpc from the X-Ray centre of the A1367 cluster at z = 0.021. Our {MUSE} observations map in detail the extended ionized gas, primarily traced by H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission, in between the members of the group. The gas morphology and its kinematics appear consistent with a tidal origin due to galaxy encounters, as also supported by the disturbed kinematics visible in one of the group members and the presence of tidal dwarf systems. A diffuse tail extending in the direction opposite to the cluster centre is also detected, hinting at a global ram-pressure stripping of the intra-group material as {BIG} falls inside A1367. Based on the analysis of spatially-resolved emission line maps, we identify multiple ionization mechanisms for the diffuse gas filaments, including in situ photoionization from embedded {HII} regions and shocks. Combining spatially resolved kinematics and line ratios, we rule out the association of the most massive galaxy, {CGCG}097-120, with the group as this system appears to be decoupled from the intragroup medium and subject to strong ram pressure it falls into A1367. Through our new analysis, we conclude that {BIG} is shaped by pre-processing produced by gravitational interactions in the local group environment combined with ram pressure stripping by the global cluster halo.},

The simulations predict that {\textasciitilde}50 per cent of satellites survive to redshift z = 0, with higher survival fractions in massive clusters than in groups and only small differences between baryonic and pure N-body simulations. For clusters, up to 90 per cent of galaxy disruption occurs in lower-mass sub-groups (i.e., during pre-processing); 96 per cent of satellites in massive clusters that were accreted at z {\textless} 2 and have not been pre-processed survive. Of those satellites that are disrupted, only a few per cent merge with other satellites, even in low-mass groups. The survival fraction changes rapidly from less than 10 per cent of those accreted at high z to more than 90 per cent at low z. This shift, which reflects faster disruption of satellites accreted at higher z, happens at lower z for more massive galaxies and those accreted onto less massive haloes. The disruption of satellite galaxies is found to correlate only weakly with their pre-accretion baryon content, star formation rate, and size, so that surviving galaxies are nearly unbiased in these properties. These results suggest that satellite disruption in massive haloes is uncommon, and that it is predominantly the result of gravitational rather than baryonic processes.},

	abstract = {The characterisation of galaxy-scale outflows in terms of their multi-phase nature, amount, and effects of flowing material is crucial to place constraints on models of galaxy evolution. This study can proceed only with the detailed investigation of individual targets. We present a spatially resolved spectroscopic optical data analysis of Mkn 848, a complex system consisting of two merging galaxies at z{\textasciitilde}0.04 that are separated 7.5 kpc (projected distance). Motivated by the presence of a multi-phase outflow in the north-west system revealed by the {SDSS} integrated spectrum, we analysed the publicly available {MaNGA} data, which cover almost the entire merging system, to study the physical properties of cool and warm gas in detail. Galaxy-wide outflowing gas in multiple phases is revealed for the first time in the two merging galaxies. We also detect spatially resolved resonant {NaID} emission associated with the outflows. The derived outflow energetics may be consistent with a scenario in which both winds are accelerated by stellar processes and {AGN} activity, although we favour an {AGN} origin given the high outflow velocities and the ionisation conditions observed in the outflow regions. Deeper observations are required, however, to better constrain the nature of these multi-phase outflows. Outflow energetics in the north-west system are strongly different between the ionised and atomic gas components, the latter of which is associated with mass outflow rate and kinetic and momentum powers that are 1-2 dex higher; those associated with the south-east galaxy are instead similar. Strong kp-scale outflows are revealed in an ongoing merger system, suggesting that feedback can potentially impact the host galaxy even in the early merger phases. The characterisation of the neutral and ionised gas phases has proved to be crucial for a comprehensive study of the outflow phenomena.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02886},
	abstract = {To study the dust evolution in the cosmological structure formation history, we perform a smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulation with a dust enrichment model in a cosmological volume. We adopt the dust evolution model that represents the grain size distribution by two sizes and takes into account stellar dust production and interstellar dust processing. We examine the dust mass function and the scaling properties of dust in terms of the characteristics of galaxies. The simulation broadly reproduces the observed dust mass functions at redshift \$z = 0\$, except that it overproduces the massive end at dust mass \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{d\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}\$ \$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. This overabundance is due to overproducing massive gas/metal-rich systems, but we also note that the relation between stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity is reproduced fairly well by our recipe. The relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity shows a good agreement with the observed one at \$z=0\$, which indicates successful implementation of dust evolution in our cosmological simulation. Star formation consumes not only gas but also dust, causing a decreasing trend of the dust-to-stellar mass ratio at the high-mass end of galaxies. We also examine the redshift evolution up to \$z {\textbackslash}sim{\textasciitilde} 5\$, and find that the galaxies have on average the highest dust mass at \$z = 1-2\$. For the grain size distribution, we find that galaxies with metallicity \${\textbackslash}sim 0.3{\textasciitilde} Z\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ tend to have the highest small-to-large grain abundance ratio; consequently, the extinction curves in those galaxies have the steepest ultraviolet slopes.},

Our sample comprises spectra from a total of 264 emission-line systems, ranging from individual {HII} regions to whole galaxies, and including 23 composite {HII} regions in predominantly 'main-sequence' galaxies from the {MaNGA} survey. We utilise 130 of these systems with directly measurable T({OII}) to derive a new metallicity-dependent T({OIII})-T({OII}) relation that provides a better representation of our varied data set than existing relations from the literature. Importantly, we find that all the T({OIII})-T({OII}) relations considered here intrinsically under-estimate Z\_Te at low O++/O+ by up to 0.6 dex, and provide an empirical correction based on strong-emission lines to account for this bias when using our relation. Our new Te method therefore allows accurate metallicities (1sigma = 0.08 dex) to be derived for any low-redshift system with an [{OIII}]4363 line detection, regardless of its physical size or ionisation state. This new Te method is then used to form the mass - metallicity relation ({MZR}) for a set of 118 local star-forming galaxies that is not strongly biased to starbursts. Our new {MZR} is in very good agreement with those formed from direct measurements of metal recombination lines and blue supergiant absorption lines, in contrast to most other Te-based and strong-line-based {MZRs}. Our new Te method therefore provides an accurate and precise way of obtaining metallicities for a large and diverse range of star-forming systems in the local Universe.},

Previous idealized simulations, focussing on small amplitude perturbations in the intracluster medium ({ICM}), found that cold gas condenses out of the hot {ICM} in global thermal balance when the background \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 10\$. Sources such as galaxy wakes and dense cosmological filaments can seed large density contrast in the medium and give rise to cold gas in halos with \$(t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}) {\textgreater} 10\$, consistent with the recent observations. From our simulations, we introduce a condensation curve in the \$({\textbackslash}delta {\textbackslash}rho/{\textbackslash}rho)\$ - min\$(t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\})\$ space, that defines the threshold for condensation of multiphase gas in the {CGM}. We show that this condensation curve corresponds to \$\{(t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\})\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm blob\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 10\$ applied to the overdense blob instead of the background for which \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ can be higher. We also study the modification of the condensation curve under different conditions like entropy stratification, jet injection and the introduction of buoyantly rising bubbles. Steeper (positive) entropy gradients and bubbles shift the condensation curve to higher amplitudes of perturbations (i.e., make condensation difficult) while gentle outflows shift it to lower amplitudes of perturbations, making condensation easier. A constant entropy core, applicable to the {CGM} in smaller halos, shows condensation over a larger range of radii as compared to the steeper entropy profiles in the {ICM}.},

	abstract = {Star formation is observed to be strongly correlated to dense regions of molecular gas. Although the exact nature of the link between star formation and molecular hydrogen is still unclear, some have suggested that shielding of dense gas by dust grains is the key factor enabling the presence of both. We present a sub-grid model for use in galaxy formation simulations in which star formation is linked explicitly to local dust shielding. We developed and tested our shielding and star formation models using smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of solar and sub-solar metallicity isolated Milky Way-mass disk galaxies. We compared our dust shielding-based star formation model to two other star formation recipes that used gas temperature and H\$\_2\$ fraction as star formation criteria. We further followed the evolution of a dwarf galaxy within a cosmological context using both the shielding and H\$\_2\$-based star formation models. We find that the shielding-based model allows for star formation at higher temperatures and lower densities than a model in which star formation is tied directly to H\$\_2\$ abundance, as requiring H\$\_2\$ formation leads the gas to undergo additional gravitational collapse before star formation. However, the resulting galaxies are very similar for both the shielding and H\$\_2\$-based star formation models, and both models reproduce the resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt law. Therefore, both star formation models appear viable in the context of galaxy formation simulations.},

A source of this material may be the gas that resides between galaxies, but our understanding of the state and distribution of this gas is incomplete (Shull et al. 2012). Radio observations (Braun \& Thilker 2004) of the Local Group of galaxies have revealed hydrogen gas extending from the disk of the galaxy M31 at least halfway to M33. This feature has been interpreted to be the neutral component of a condensing intergalactic filament (Dav{\textbackslash}'e et al. 2001) which would be able to fuel star formation in M31 and M33, but simulations suggest that such a feature could also result from an interaction between both galaxies within the past few billion years (Bekki 2008). Here we report radio observations showing that about 50 per cent percent of this gas is composed of clouds, while the rest is distributed in an extended, diffuse component. The clouds have velocities comparable to those of M31 and M33, and have properties suggesting they are unrelated to other Local Group objects. We conclude that the clouds are likely to be transient condensations of gas embedded in an intergalactic filament and are therefore a potential source of fuel for future star formation in M31 and M33.},

	abstract = {Based on constraints from Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background, the baryon content of the high-redshift Universe can be precisely determined. However, at low redshift, about one-third of the baryons remain unaccounted for, which poses the long-standing missing baryon problem. The missing baryons are believed to reside in large-scale filaments in the form of warm-hot intergalactic medium ({WHIM}). In this work, we employ a novel stacking approach to explore the hot phases of the {WHIM}. Specifically, we utilize the 470 ks Chandra {LETG} data of the luminous quasar, H1821+643, along with previous measurements of {UV} absorption line systems and spectroscopic redshift measurements of galaxies toward the quasar's sightline. We repeatedly blueshift and stack the X-ray spectrum of the quasar corresponding to the redshifts of the 17 absorption line systems. Thus, we obtain a stacked spectrum with \$8.0\$ Ms total exposure, which allows us to probe X-ray absorption lines with unparalleled sensitivity. Based on the stacked data, we detect an {OVII} absorption line that exhibits a Gaussian line profile and is statistically significant at the \$3.3 {\textbackslash}sigma\$ level. Since the redshifts of the {UV} absorption line systems were known a priori, this is the first definitive detection of an X-ray absorption line originating from the {WHIM}. The equivalent width of the {OVII} line is \$(4.1{\textbackslash}pm1.3) {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{m{\textbackslash}{AA}\}\$, which corresponds to an {OVII} column density of \$(1.4{\textbackslash}pm0.4){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{15\} {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\}\$.

Based on the stacked spectra for a sample with median star-formation rates and stellar masses of {SFR} {\textasciitilde} 7 Mo/yr and M* = (1.0+/-0.1)x10{\textasciicircum}10 Mo respectively, we derive a typical mass outflow rate of {dM}/dt = 1-4 Mo/yr and a mass loading of {dM}/dt/{SFR} = 0.2--0.4. The mass loading of the wind does not show a strong trend with star-formation rate over the range {SFR} {\textasciitilde} 2--20 Mo/yr, although we identify a trend with stellar mass such that {dM}/dt/{SFR} {\textasciitilde} M*{\textasciicircum}(0.26+/-0.07). Finally, we find that the line width of the broad H-alpha increases with disk circular velocity with a sub-linear scaling relation {FWHM}\_broad {\textasciitilde} v{\textasciicircum}(0.21+/-0.05). As a result of this behavior, in the lowest mass galaxies (M* {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}10 Mo), a significant fraction of the outflowing gas should have sufficient velocity to escape the gravitational potential of the halo whilst in the highest mass galaxies (M* {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}10 Mo) most of the gas will be retained, flowing back on to the galaxy disk at later times.},

The main goal of the program is to determine whether the star formation histories ({SFHs}) of the Andromeda {dSph} satellites demonstrate significant statistical differences from those of the Milky Way, which may be attributable to the different properties of their local environments. Our observations reach the oldest main sequence turn-offs, allowing a time resolution at the oldest ages of {\textasciitilde} 1 Gyr, which is comparable to the best achievable resolution in the {MW} satellites. We find that the six {dSphs} present a variety of {SFHs} that are not strictly correlated with luminosity or present distance from M31. Specifically, we find a significant range in quenching times (lookback times from 9 to 6 Gyr), but with all quenching times more than {\textasciitilde} 6 Gyr ago. In agreement with observations of Milky Way companions of similar mass, there is no evidence of complete quenching of star formation by the cosmic {UV} background responsible for reionization, but the possibility of a degree of quenching at reionization cannot be ruled out. We do not find significant differences between the {SFHs} of the three members of the vast, thin plane of satellites and the three off-plane {dSphs}. The primary difference between the {SFHs} of the {ISLAndS} {dSphs} and Milky Way {dSph} companions of similar luminosities and host distances is the absence of very late quenching ({\textless} 5 Gyr ago) {dSphs} in the {ISLAndS} sample. Thus, models that can reproduce satellite populations with and without late quenching satellites will be of extreme interest.},

We compare dwarfs around individual Milky Way ({MW})-mass galaxies, dwarfs in Local Group ({LG})-like environments, and true field (i.e. isolated) dwarf galaxies. We reproduce observed trends wherein higher-mass dwarfs quench later (if at all), regardless of environment. We also identify differences between the environments, both in terms of "satellite vs. central" and "{LG} vs. individual {MWvs}. isolated dwarf central." Around the individual {MW}-mass hosts, we recover the result expected from environmental quenching: central galaxies in the "near field" have more extended {SFHs} than their satellite counterparts, with the former more closely resemble isolated ("true field") dwarfs (though near-field centrals are still somewhat earlier forming). However, this difference is muted in the {LG}-like environments, where both near-field centrals and satellites have similar {SFHs}, which resemble satellites of single {MW}-mass hosts. This distinction is strongest for \$M\_{\textbackslash}ast = 10{\textasciicircum}6 - 10{\textasciicircum}7{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ but exists at other masses. Our results suggest that the paired halo nature of the {LG} may regulate star formation in dwarf galaxies even beyond the virial radii of the {MW} and Andromeda.

	abstract = {Observations of low-mass satellite galaxies in the nearby Universe point towards a strong dichotomy in their star-forming properties relative to systems with similar mass in the field. Specifically, satellite galaxies are preferentially gas poor and no longer forming stars, while their field counterparts are largely gas rich and actively forming stars. Much of the recent work to understand this dichotomy has been statistical in nature, determining not just that environmental processes are most likely responsible for quenching these low-mass systems but also that they must operate very quickly after infall onto the host system, with quenching timescales \${\textbackslash}lesssim 2{\textasciitilde} \{{\textbackslash}rm Gyr\}\$ at \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. This work utilizes the newly-available \$Gaia\$ {DR}2 proper motion measurements along with the Phat {ELVIS} suite of high-resolution, cosmological, zoom-in simulations to study low-mass satellite quenching around the Milky Way on an object-by-object basis. We derive constraints on the infall times for \$37\$ of the known low-mass satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, finding that \${\textbackslash}gtrsim{\textasciitilde}70{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the `classical' satellites of the Milky Way are consistent with the very short quenching timescales inferred from the total population in previous works. The remaining classical Milky Way satellites have quenching timescales noticeably longer, with \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm quench\} {\textbackslash}sim 6 - 8{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm Gyr\}\$, highlighting how detailed orbital modeling is likely necessary to understand the specifics of environmental quenching for individual satellite galaxies. Additionally, we find that the \$6\$ ultra-faint dwarf galaxies with publicly available \${HST}\$-based star-formation histories are all consistent with having their star formation shut down prior to infall onto the Milky Way -- which, combined with their very early quenching times, strongly favors quenching driven by reionization.},

Using galaxy group/cluster catalogs from {SDSS} {DR}7, together with a cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star formation histories and quenching timescales of satellites of M\_star {\textgreater} 5 x 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_sun at z=0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing and ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly accounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z{\textasciitilde}0.5, or {\textasciitilde}5 Gyr ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the {SFRs} of satellites at their time of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the evolution of central galaxy {SFRs} and quiescent fractions. With this, we constrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of satellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant process for building up all quiescent galaxies at M\_star {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}10 M\_sun. We then constrain satellite star formation histories, finding a 'delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario: satellite {SFRs} evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall, after which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of {\textless} 0.8 Gyr. These quenching timescales are shorter for more massive satellites but do not depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in satellite quiescent fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a lower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible for up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. Because of the long time delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellar mass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact provides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.},

The galaxy population naturally divides into a red and blue sequence with the locus of the sequences in colour-mass and colour-concentration index not varying strongly with environment. The fraction of galaxies on the red sequence is determined in bins of 0.2 in log Sigma and log mass (12 x 13 bins). The red fraction f\_r generally increases continuously in both Sigma and mass such that there is a unified relation: f\_r = F(Sigma,mass). Two simple functions are proposed which provide good fits to the data. These data are compared with analogous quantities in semi-analytical models based on the Millennium N-body simulation: the Bower et al. (2006) and Croton et al. (2006) models that incorporate {AGN} feedback. Both models predict a strong dependence of the red fraction on stellar mass and environment that is qualitatively similar to the observations. However, a quantitative comparison shows that the Bower et al. model is a significantly better match; this appears to be due to the different treatment of feedback in central galaxies.},

We investigate a series of simple, one-parameter quenching models in order to understand what is required to explain the low quenched fraction and conclude that either the quenching timescale is very long ({\textgreater} 9.5 Gyr, a "slow starvation" scenario) or that the environmental trigger is not well matched to accretion within the virial volume. We discuss these results in light of the fact that most of the low mass dwarf satellites in the Local Group are quenched, a seeming contradiction that could point to a characteristic mass scale for satellite quenching.},

In order to investigate the environmental effects, we examine the properties of 'central' and 'satellite' galaxies separately. For central galaxies, we are unable to conclude whether star formation quenching is primarily connected with halo mass or stellar mass, because these two quantities are themselves strongly correlated. For satellite galaxies, a nearly equally strong dependence on halo mass and stellar mass is seen. We make the same comparison for five different semi-analytic models based on three independently developed codes. We find that the models with active galactic nuclei feedback reproduce reasonably well the dependence of the fraction of central red and passive galaxies on halo mass and stellar mass. However, for satellite galaxies, the same models badly overproduce the fraction of red/passive galaxies and do not reproduce the empirical trends with stellar mass or halo mass. This satellite overquenching problem is caused by the too-rapid stripping of the satellites' hot gas haloes, which leads to rapid strangulation of star formation. © 2009 {RAS}.},

On the other hand, less massive primaries have steeper satellite profiles that agree quite well with the expected dark matter distribution and are dominated by blue satellites, even in the inner regions where strong environmental effects are expected. In fact, such effects appear to be strong only for primaries with \$M\_* {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. This behaviour is not reproduced by current semi-analytic simulations, where satellite profiles always parallel those of the dark matter and satellite populations are predominantly red for primaries of all masses. The disagreement with {SDSS} suggests that environmental effects are too efficient in the models. Modifying the treatment of environmental and star formation processes can substantially increase the fraction of blue satellites, but their radial distribution remains significantly shallower than observed. It seems that most satellites of low-mass primaries can continue to form stars even after orbiting within their joint halo for 5 Gyr or more.},

We performed a spatially resolved analysis of the relation between star formation rate density and gas density in the disc and tail of the galaxy at the resolution of our {HI} data. The star formation efficiency of the disc is about 10 times higher than that of the tail at fixed {HI} surface densities. Both the inner and outer parts of {JO}206 show an enhanced star formation compared to regions of similar {HI} surface density in field galaxies.

	abstract = {In the local Universe, there is a strong division in the star-forming properties of low-mass galaxies, with star formation largely ubiquitous amongst the field population while satellite systems are predominantly quenched. This dichotomy implies that environmental processes play the dominant role in suppressing star formation within this low-mass regime (\$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{5.5-8\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$). As shown by observations of the Local Volume, however, there is a non-negligible population of passive systems in the field, which challenges our understanding of quenching at low masses. By applying the satellite quenching models of Fillingham et al. (2015) to subhalo populations in the Exploring the Local Volume In Simulations ({ELVIS}) suite, we investigate the role of environmental processes in quenching star formation within the nearby field. Using model parameters that reproduce the satellite quenched fraction in the Local Group, we predict a quenched fraction -- due solely to environmental effects -- of \${\textbackslash}sim 0.52 {\textbackslash}pm 0.26\$ within \$1{\textless} R/R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\} {\textless} 2\$ of the Milky Way and M31. This is in good agreement with current observations of the Local Volume and suggests that the majority of the passive field systems observed at these distances are quenched via environmental mechanisms. Beyond \$2{\textasciitilde}R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$, however, dwarf galaxy quenching becomes difficult to explain through an interaction with either the Milky Way or M31, such that more isolated, field dwarfs may be self-quenched as a result of star-formation feedback.},

	abstract = {In previous papers of this series, we developed a new algorithm for modeling the formation of star clusters in galaxy formation simulations. Here we investigate how dissolution of bound star clusters affects the shape of the cluster mass function and the metallicity distribution of surviving clusters. Cluster evolution includes the loss of stars that become unbound due to tidal disruption as well as mass-loss due to stellar evolution. We calculate the tidal tensor along cluster trajectories and use it to estimate the instantaneous mass-loss rate. The typical tidal tensor exhibits large variations on a time-scale of \${\textbackslash}sim100\${\textasciitilde}Myr, with maximum eigenvalue of \$10{\textasciicircum}7\${\textasciitilde}Gyr\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, and median value of \$10{\textasciicircum}4\${\textasciitilde}Gyr\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ for the first Gyr after cluster formation. As a result of dynamical disruption, at the final available output of our simulations at redshift \$z{\textbackslash}approx1.5\$, the cluster mass function has an approximately log-normal shape peaked at \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{4.3\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. Extrapolation of the disruption to \$z=0\$ results in too many low-mass clusters compared to the observed Galactic globular clusters ({GCs}). Over 70{\textbackslash}\% of {GC} candidates are completely disrupted before the present; only 10{\textbackslash}\% of the total {GC} candidate mass remains in surviving clusters. The total mass of surviving clusters at \$z=0\$ varies from run to run in the range \$(2-6){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}7M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, consistent with the observed mass of {GC} systems in Milky Way-sized galaxies. The metallicity distributions of all massive star clusters and of the surviving {GCs} have similar shapes but different normalization because of cluster disruption. The model produces a larger fraction of very metal-poor clusters than observed. A robust prediction of the model is the age-metallicity relation, in which metal-rich clusters are systematically younger than metal-poor clusters by up to 3{\textasciitilde}Gyr.},

	abstract = {We measure differences in the emission line flux from the circumgalactic medium, {CGM}, of galaxies in different environments. Such differences could be a critical clue in explaining a range of galaxy properties that depend on environment. Using large samples of stacked archival spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we find that the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ + [N \{{\textbackslash}small {II}\}] emission line flux from the {CGM} within 50 kpc of \${\textbackslash}sim\$ L\${\textasciicircum}*\$ galaxies is lower both for galaxies that lie within a projected distance of \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 500 kpc from a massive (\$M\_*{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) galaxy and for galaxies in richer/denser environments. The environmental differences are statistically significant even after we control for galaxy mass and morphology. We interpret these observations as a direct signature of environmentally-caused strangulation. We present a simple, heuristic model for the effect of a massive parent galaxy. In this model, the {CGM} cool gas fraction within 50 kpc is significantly decreased for galaxies that lie within 700 kpc of a massive galaxy, with about 80{\textbackslash}\% of the cool gas removed even when the galaxy is at a distance of 500 kpc from its massive parent. However, we discuss alternative physical causes for the observed behavior and discuss ways forward in addressing open questions.},

	abstract = {We study the spin alignment of galaxies and halos with respect to filaments and walls of the cosmic web, identified with {DisPerSE}, using the {SIMBA} simulation from z=0-2. Massive halos' spins are oriented perpendicularly to their closest filament's axis and walls, while low mass halos tend to have their spins parallel to filaments and in the plane of walls. A similar mass-dependent spin flip is found for galaxies, albeit with a weaker signal particularly at low mass and low-z, suggesting that galaxies' spins retain memory of their larger-scale environment. Low-z star-forming and rotation-dominated galaxies tend to have spins parallel to nearby filaments, while quiescent and dispersion-dominated galaxies show preferentially perpendicular orientation; the star formation trend can be fully explained by the stellar mass correlation, but the morphology trend cannot. There is a strong dependence on {HI} mass, such that high-{HI} galaxies tend to have parallel spins while low-{HI} galaxies are perpendicular, which persists even when matching samples in stellar mass, suggesting that {HI} content traces anisotropic infall more faithfully than the stellar component. Finally, at fixed stellar mass, the strength of spin alignments correlates with the filament's density, with parallel alignment for galaxies in high density environments. These findings are consistent with conditional tidal torque theory, and highlight a significant correlation between galactic spin and the larger scale tides that are important e.g. for interpreting weak lensing studies. {SIMBA} allows us to rule out numerical grid locking as the cause of previously-seen low mass alignment.},

	abstract = {This paper reports the discovery of spatially-extended line-emitting nebula, reaching to {\textasciitilde}100 physical kpc (pkpc) from a damped Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} absorber ({DLA}) at z\_DLA=0.313 along the sightline toward {QSO} {PKS}1127-145 (z\_QSO=1.188). This {DLA} was known to be associated with a galaxy group of dynamical mass M\_group {\textasciitilde}3e12 M\_sun, but its physical origin remained ambiguous. New wide-field integral field observations revealed a giant nebula detected in [{OII}], H\{{\textbackslash}beta\}, [{OIII}], H\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}, and [{NII}] emission, with the line-emitting gas following closely the motions of group galaxies. One of the denser streams passes directly in front of the {QSO} with kinematics consistent with the absorption profiles recorded in the {QSO} echelle spectra. The emission morphology, kinematics, and line ratios of the nebula suggest that shocks and turbulent mixing layers, produced as a result of stripped gaseous streams moving at supersonic speed across the ambient hot medium, contribute significantly to the ionization of the gas. While the {DLA} may not be associated with any specific detected member of the group, both the kinematic and dust properties are consistent with the {DLA} originating in streams of gas stripped from sub-L* group members at {\textless}{\textasciitilde}25 pkpc from the {QSO} sightline. This study demonstrates that gas stripping in low-mass galaxy groups is effective in releasing metal-enriched gas from star-forming regions, producing absorption systems in {QSO} spectra, and that combining absorption and emission-line observations provides an exciting new opportunity for studying gas and galaxy co-evolution.},

In this paper, we present a novel model to investigate the chemical enrichment of the near-pristine {DLA} population. This model accounts for the mass distribution of the enriching stellar population, the typical explosion energy of their supernovae, and the average number of stars that contribute to the enrichment of these {DLAs}. We conduct a maximum likelihood analysis of these model parameters using the observed relative element abundances ([C/O], [Si/O], and [Fe/O]) of the 11 most metal-poor {DLAs} currently known. We find that the mass distribution of the stars that have enriched this sample of metal-poor {DLAs} can be well-described by a Salpeter-like {IMF} slope at M {\textgreater} 10 M\_sun and that a typical metal-poor {DLA} has been enriched by {\textless} 72 massive stars (95\% confidence), with masses {\textless} 40 M\_sun. The inferred typical explosion energy (E\_exp = 1.8{\textasciicircum}\{+0.3\}\_\{-0.2\}x10{\textasciicircum}51 erg) is somewhat lower than that found by recent works that model the enrichment of metal-poor halo stars. These constraints suggest that some of the metal-poor {DLAs} in our sample may have been enriched by Population {II} stars. Using our enrichment model, we also infer some of the typical physical properties of the most metal-poor {DLAs}. We estimate that the total stellar mass content is log10(M\_*/M\_sun) = 3.5{\textasciicircum}\{+0.3\}\_\{-0.4\} and the total gas mass is log10(M\_gas/M\_sun) = 7.0{\textasciicircum}\{+0.3\}\_\{-0.4\} for systems with a relative oxygen abundance [O/H] {\textasciitilde} -3.0.},

We run the radiative transfer code {SKIRT} on a sample of submillimeter-bright galaxies drawn from the Feedback in Realistic Environments ({FIRE}) project. These simulated galaxies reach Milky Way masses by z=2. Our modelling provides predictions for the full rest-frame far-ultraviolet-to-far-infrared spectral energy distributions of these simulated galaxies, as well as 25-pc-resolution maps of their emission across the wavelength spectrum. The derived morphologies are notably different in different wavebands, with the same galaxy often appearing clumpy and extended in the far-ultraviolet yet an ordered spiral at far-infrared wavelengths. The observed-frame 870-\${\textbackslash}mu\$m half-light radii of our {FIRE}-2 galaxies are {\textasciitilde}0.5-4kpc, consistent with existing {ALMA} observations of galaxies with similarly high redshifts and stellar masses. In both simulated and observed galaxies, the dust continuum emission is generally more compact than the cold gas and the dust mass, but more extended than the stellar component. The most extreme cases of compact dust emission seem to be driven by particularly compact recent star-formation, which generates steep dust temperature gradients. Our results confirm that the spatial extent of the dust continuum emission is sensitive to both the dust mass and {SFR} distributions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13506},
	abstract = {Gaseous halos play a key role for understanding inflow, feedback and the overall baryon budget in galaxies. Literature models predict transitions of the state of the gaseous halo between cold and hot accretion, winds, fountains and hydrostatic halos at certain galaxy masses. Since luminosities of radio {AGN} are sensitive to halo densities, any significant transition would be expected to show up in the radio luminosities of large samples of galaxies. The Low Frequency Array ({LOFAR}) Two Metre Sky Survey ({LoTSS}) has indeed identified a galaxy stellar mass scale, \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ , above which the radio luminosities increase disproportionately. Here, we investigate, if radio luminosities of galaxies, especially the marked rise at galaxy masses around \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, can be explained with standard assumptions on jet powers, scaling between black hole-mass and galaxy mass and gaseous halos. We developed models for the radio luminosity of radio {AGN} in halos under infall, galactic wind and hydrostatic conditions based on observational data and theoretical constraints, and compared it to {LoTSS} data for a large sample of galaxies in the mass rangebetween \$10{\textasciicircum}\{8.5\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. Assuming the same characteristic upper limit to jet powers as is known from high galaxy masses to hold at all masses, we find that the maximum radio luminosities for the hydrostatic gas halos fit well with the upper envelope of the distribution of the {LOFAR} data. The marked rise in radio luminosity at \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ is matched in our model, and is related to significant change in halo gas density around this galaxy mass, which is a consequence of the lower cooling rates at higher virial temperature. Wind and infall models overpredict the radio luminosities at small galaxy masses and have no particular steepening of the run of the radio luminosities predicted at any galaxy mass. [...]},

Exploiting the data from the {GAs} Stripping Phenomena in galaxies with {MUSE} ({GASP}), we provide the first characterisation of the spatially resolved properties of galaxies embedded in filaments in the local Universe. The four galaxies we focus on show peculiar ionised gas distributions: Halpha clouds have been observed beyond four times the effective radius. The gas kinematics, metallicity map and the ratios of emission line fluxes confirm that they do belong to the galaxy gas disk, the analysis of their spectra shows that very weak stellar continuum is associated to them. Similarly, the star formation history and luminosity weighted age maps point to a recent formation of such clouds. The clouds are powered by star formation, and are characterised by intermediate values of dust absorption. We hypothesise a scenario in which the observed features are due to "Cosmic Web Enhancement": we are most likely witnessing galaxies passing through or flowing within filaments that assist the gas cooling and increase the extent of the star formation in the densest regions in the circumgalactic gas.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08993},
	abstract = {Spiral galaxies comprise three major structural components; thin discs, thick discs, and central bulges. Relative dominance of these components is known to correlate with the total mass of the galaxy, and produces a remarkable morphological variety of spiral galaxies. Although there are many formation scenarios regarding individual components, no unified theory exists which explains this systematic variation. The cold-flow hypothesis predicts that galaxies grow by accretion of cold gas from cosmic webs (cold accretion) when their mass is below a certain threshold, whereas in the high-mass regime the gas that entered the dark matter halo is first heated by shock waves to high temperatures and then accretes to the forming galaxy as it cools emitting radiation (cooling flow). This hypothesis also predicts that massive galaxies at high redshifts have a hybrid accretion structure in which filaments of cold inflowing gas penetrate surrounding hot gas. In the case of Milky Way, the previous study suggested that the cold accretion created its thick disc in early times and the cooling flow formed the thin disc in later epochs. Here we report that extending this idea to galaxies with various masses and associating the hybrid accretion with the formation of bulges reproduces the observed mass-dependent structures of spiral galaxies: namely, more massive galaxies have lower thick disc mass fractions and higher bulge mass fractions. The proposed scenario predicts that thick discs are older in age and poorer in iron than thin discs, the trend observed in the Milky Way ({MW}) and other spiral galaxies.},

Successful extraction of information in such a regime thus requires, at the very least, unbiased models for the impact of galaxy formation on the matter distribution, and can benefit from complementary observational priors. This work reviews the current state of the art in the modelling of baryons for cosmology, from numerical methods to approximate analytical prescriptions, and makes recommendations for studies in the next decade, including a discussion of potential probe combinations that can help constrain the role of baryons in cosmological studies.

From the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm H{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ kinematics, we find that 60\% of galaxies show a decrease in the rotation velocity as a function of height above the midplane. This lag is characteristic of {eDIG}, and we measure a median lag of 21 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ which is comparable to lags measured in the literature. We also investigate variations in the lag with radius. \${\textbackslash}rm H\{{\textbackslash}small I\}\$ lags have been reported to systematically decrease with galactocentric radius. We find both increasing and decreasing ionized gas lags with radius, as well as a large number of galaxies consistent with no radial lag variation, and investigate these results in the context of internal and external origins for the lagging ionized gas. We confirm that the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm [S\{{\textbackslash}small {II}\}]\}\$/\$\{{\textbackslash}rm H{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ and \$\{{\textbackslash}rm [N\{{\textbackslash}small {II}\}]\}\$/\$\{{\textbackslash}rm H{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ line ratios increase with height above the midplane as is characteristic of {eDIG}. The ionization of the {eDIG} is dominated by star-forming complexes (leaky \$\{{\textbackslash}rm H\{{\textbackslash}small {II}\}\}\$ regions). We conclude that the lagging ionized gas is turbulent ejected gas likely resulting from star formation activity in the disk as opposed to gas in the stellar thick disk or bulge.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05645},
	abstract = {The origin of dust in galaxy halos or in the circum-galactic medium ({CGM}) is still a mystery. We investigate if the radiation pressure in high-redshift (\$z{\textbackslash}sim 10\$) galaxies can efficiently transport dust to halos. To clarify the first dust enrichment of galaxy halos in the early Universe, we solve the motion of a dust grain considering radiation pressure, gas drag, and gravity in the vertical direction of the galactic disc. Radiation pressure is estimated in a consistent manner with the stellar spectra and dust extinction. As a consequence, we find that dust grains with radii \$a{\textbackslash}sim 0.1{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu\$m successfully escape from the galactic disc if the ongoing star formation episode converts more than 15 per cent of the baryon content into stars and lasts \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 30\$ Myr, while larger and smaller grains are trapped in the disc because of gravity and gas drag, respectively. We also show that grain charge significantly enhances gas drag at a few--10 scale heights of the galactic disc, where the grain velocities are suppressed to \${\textbackslash}sim 1\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. There is an optimum dust-to-gas ratio (\${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$) in the galactic disc and an optimum virial mass \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$--\$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ for the transport of \$a{\textbackslash}sim 0.1{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu\$m grains to the halo. We conclude that early dust enrichment of galaxy halos at \$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10\$ is important for the origin of dust in the {CGM}.},

We survey systems from ultrafaint dwarf (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast \}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{4\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) through Milky Way/Local Group ({MW}/{LG}) masses, systematically vary uncertain {CR} parameters (e.g. the diffusion coefficient κ and streaming velocity), and study a broad ensemble of galaxy properties [masses, star formation ({SF}) histories, mass profiles, phase structure, morphologies, etc.]. We confirm previous conclusions that magnetic fields, conduction, and viscosity on resolved (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 1{\textbackslash},\$ pc) scales have only small effects on bulk galaxy properties. {CRs} have relatively weak effects on all galaxy properties studied in dwarfs (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast \} {\textbackslash}ll 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$), or at high redshifts (z ≳ 1–2), for any physically reasonable parameters. However, at higher masses (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) and z ≲ 1–2, {CRs} can suppress {SF} and stellar masses by factors ∼2–4, given reasonable injection efficiencies and relatively high effective diffusion coefficients \${\textbackslash}kappa {\textbackslash}gtrsim 3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{29\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$. At lower κ, {CRs} take too long to escape dense star-forming gas and lose their energy to collisional hadronic losses, producing negligible effects on galaxies and violating empirical constraints from spallation and γ-ray emission. At much higher κ {CRs} escape too efficiently to have appreciable effects even in the {CGM}. But around \${\textbackslash}kappa {\textbackslash}sim 3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{29\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$, {CRs} escape the galaxy and build up a {CR}-pressure-dominated halo which maintains approximate virial equilibrium and supports relatively dense, cool (T ≪ 106 K) gas that would otherwise rain on to the galaxy. {CR} ‘heating’ (from collisional and streaming losses) is never dominant.},

	abstract = {We present a two-dimensional mapping of stellar population age components, emission-line fluxes, gas excitation and kinematics within the inner \${\textbackslash}sim200\$ pc of the Seyfert 2 galaxy {NGC} 2110. We used the Gemini North Integral Field Spectrograph ({NIFS}) in the J and K bands at a spatial resolution of \${\textbackslash}sim22\$ pc. The unresolved nuclear continuum is originated in combined contributions of young stellar population ({SP}; age\${\textbackslash}leq100\$ Myr), a featureless {AGN} continuum and hot dust emission. The young-intermediate {SP} (\$100{\textless}\$age\${\textbackslash}leq700\$ Myr) is distributed in a ring-shaped structure at \${\textbackslash}approx140\$ pc from the nucleus, which is roughly coincident with the lowest values of the stellar velocity dispersion. In the inner \${\textbackslash}approx115\$ pc the old {SP} (age\${\textgreater}2\$ Gyr) is dominant. The [{FeII}]1.25\${\textbackslash}mu\$m emission-line flux distribution is correlated with the radio emission and its kinematics comprise two components, one from gas rotating in the galaxy plane and another from gas in outflow within a bicone oriented along north-south.

We estimate: (1) an ionized gas mass outflow rate of \${\textbackslash}sim0.5\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$/yr at \${\textbackslash}sim\$70 pc from the nucleus; and (2) a kinetic power for the outflow of only 0.05\% of the {AGN} bolometric luminosity implying weak feedback effect on the galaxy.},

We search for large-scale ionized outflows associated with six optically selected {QSO}2 (five non-radio-loud and one radio-loud) at \$z{\textbackslash}sim\$ 0.2-0.5, targeting objects with extended radio structures. We have obtained {OSIRIS}/{GTC} optical long slit spectroscopy data for these six {QSO}2 with the slit located along the radio axis. We traced the gas kinematics with the [{OIII}]\${\textbackslash}lambda\$4959,5007 lines to investigate ionized outflows and characterize the dynamical state of the host galaxies. This second study has been complemented with previously published {FORS}2/{VLT} spectroscopic data of 13 more {QSO}2 at similar z. We identify ionized outflows in four out of the six {QSO}2 observed with the {GTC}. The outflows are spatially unresolved in two {QSO}2 and compact in a third (radial size of R=0.8\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.3 kpc). Of particular interest is the radio-quiet {QSO}2 {SDSS} 0741+3020 at z=0.47, associated with a giant \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 112 kpc nebula. An ionized outflow probably induced by the radio structures has been detected along the axis defined by the central \${\textbackslash}sim\$1{\textbackslash}arcsec{\textbackslash} radio structure, extending up to at least \${\textbackslash}sim\$4 kpc from the active galactic nucleus ({AGN}). Turbulent gas (\${\textbackslash}sigma{\textbackslash}sim\$130 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) has also been detected across the giant gas nebula up to \${\textbackslash}sim\$40 kpc from the {AGN}. This turbulence may have been induced by outflows triggered by the interaction between a so-far undetected large-scale radio source and the nebula. Regarding the dynamical state of the host galaxies, we find that the majority of the {QSO}2 show v/\${\textbackslash}sigma{\textless}\$ 1, implying that they are dominated by random motions (so-called dispersion-dominated systems). Most (17 of 19) fall in the area of the E/S0 galaxies in the dynamical diagram v/\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ versus \${\textbackslash}sigma\$. None are consistent with spiral or disk galaxies.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02741},
	abstract = {We examine the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes in the Simba cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. Simba grows black holes via gravitational torque-limited accretion from cold gas and Bondi accretion from hot gas, while feedback from black holes is modeled in radiative and jet modes depending on the Eddington ratio (\$f\_\{Edd\}\$). Simba shows generally good agreement with local studies of black hole properties, such as the black hole mass--stellar velocity dispersion (\$M\_\{{BH}\}-{\textbackslash}sigma\$) relation, 2 the black hole accretion rate vs. star formation rate ({BHAR}--{SFR}), and the black hole mass function. \$M\_\{{BH}\}-{\textbackslash}sigma\$ evolves such that galaxies at a given \$M\_\{{BH}\}\$ have higher \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ at higher redshift, consistent with no evolution in \$M\_\{{BH}\}-M\_*\$. For \$M\_\{{BH}\}{\textless}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, \$f\_\{Edd\}\$ is anti-correlated with \$M\_\{{BH}\}\$ since the {BHAR} is approximately independent of \$M\_\{{BH}\}\$, while at higher masses \$f\_\{Edd\}-M\_\{{BH}\}\$ flattens and has a larger scatter. {BHAR} vs. {SFR} is invariant with redshift, but \$f\_\{Edd\}\$ drops steadily with time at a given \$M\_\{{BH}\}\$, such that all but the most massive black holes are accreting in a radiatively efficient mode at \$z{\textgreater}{\textbackslash}sim 2\$. The black hole mass function amplitude decreases with redshift and is locally dominated by quiescent galaxies for \$M\_\{{BH}\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, but for \$z{\textgreater}{\textbackslash}sim 1\$ star forming galaxies dominate at all \$M\_\{{BH}\}\$. The \$z=0\$ \$f\_\{Edd\}\$ distribution is roughly lognormal with a peak at \$f\_\{Edd\}{\textless}{\textbackslash}sim 0.01\$ as observed, shifting to higher \$f\_\{Edd\}\$ at higher redshifts. Finally, we study the dependence of black hole properties with {\textbackslash}{HI}{\textbackslash} content and find that the correlation between gas content and star formation rate is modulated by black hole properties, such that higher {SFR} galaxies at a given gas content have smaller black holes with higher \$f\_\{Edd\}\$},

We study the relation between the properties of globular cluster systems - as quantified by the {GC} specific frequency ({SN}) - and the properties of their host galaxies. In order to understand the origin of the relation between the {GC} specific frequency ({SN}) and galaxy mass, we devise a theoretical model for the specific frequency ({SN},th). {GC} erosion is considered to be an important aspect for shaping this relation, since observations show that galaxies with low densities have a higher {SN}, while high density galaxies have a small {SN}. We construct a model based on the hypothesis that star-formation is clustered and depends on the minimum embedded star cluster mass (Mecl,min), the slope of the power-law embedded cluster mass function (beta) and the relation between the star formation rate ({SFR}) and the maximum star cluster mass (Mecl,max).

	abstract = {We present a study of the gas cycle and star formation history in the central 500 pc of the Milky Way, known as Central Molecular Zone ({CMZ}). Through hydrodynamical simulations of the inner 4.5 kpc of our Galaxy, we follow the gas cycle in a completely self-consistent way, starting from gas radial inflow due to the Galactic bar, the channelling of this gas into a dense, star-forming ring/stream at {\textasciitilde} 200 - 300 pc from the Galactic centre, and the launching of galactic outflows powered by stellar feedback. We find that star formation activity in the {CMZ} goes through oscillatory burst/quench cycles, with a period of tens to hundreds of Myr, characterised by roughly constant gas mass but order-of-magnitude level variations in the star formation rate. Comparison with the observed present-day star formation rate of the {CMZ} suggests that we are currently near a minimum of this cycle. Stellar feedback drives a mainly two-phase wind off the Galactic disc. The warm phase dominates the mass flux, and carries 100 - 200 \% of the gas mass converted into stars. However, most of this gas goes into a fountain and falls back onto the disc rather than escaping the Galaxy. The hot phase carries most of the energy, with a time-averaged energy outflow rate of 10 - 20 \% of the supernova energy budget.},

Acquiring these datasets across full galactic systems will prove crucial for obtaining population samples that enable us to understand the time evolution of similar regions, and the variability of conditions among coeval regions. Separating the spatial and temporal dependencies in such way for different physical processes involved in star formation and the injection of feedback is crucial to overcome the inherit degeneracies associated with observing instantaneous snapshots of a dynamic {ISM} at any given time. Emission line diagnostics are at the core of measuring the physical condition in {\textbackslash}ion\{H\}\{ii\} regions (e.g. dynamics, {SFR}, chemical abundances, dust extinction, ionization and excitation, etc.). These measurements require high spatial resolution, contiguous coverage across full galactic systems, and sensitivities significantly deeper than past efforts.

	abstract = {An understanding of astrophysical feedback is important for constraining models of galaxy formation and for extracting cosmological information from current and future weak lensing surveys. The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, quantified via the Compton-\$y\$ parameter, is a powerful tool for studying feedback, because it directly probes the pressure of the hot, ionized gas residing in dark matter halos. Cross-correlations between galaxies and maps of Compton-\$y\$ obtained from cosmic microwave background surveys are sensitive to the redshift evolution of the gas pressure, and its dependence on halo mass. In this work, we use galaxies identified in year one data from the Dark Energy Survey and Compton-\$y\$ maps constructed from Planck observations. We find highly significant (roughly \$12{\textbackslash}sigma\$) detections of galaxy-\$y\$ cross-correlation in multiple redshift bins. By jointly fitting these measurements as well as measurements of galaxy clustering, we constrain the halo bias-weighted, gas pressure of the Universe as a function of redshift between \$0.15 {\textbackslash}lesssim z {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.75\$. We compare these measurements to predictions from hydrodynamical simulations, allowing us to constrain the amount of thermal energy in the halo gas relative to that resulting from gravitational collapse.},

The models can serve as initial conditions for simulations of isolated galaxies that include both hydrodynamics and collisionless dynamics. We test the code by evolving a pair of simple gas disc-halo models, which differ only in the initial temperature of the gas component. The models are similar to the ones considered in the Wang et al. except that here, the halo is live whereas they included the halo as a fixed potential. We find that the basic structural properties of the models, such as the rotation curve and surface density profiles, are well-preserved over 1.5 Gyr. We also construct a Milky Way model that includes thin and thick stellar disc components, a gas disc, a bulge, and a dark halo. Bar formation occurs in all disc-like components at about 1 Gyr. The bar is strongest in the thin disc while the gas disc contains the most prominent spiral features. The length of the bar in our model is comparable to what has been inferred for the Galactic bar.},

	abstract = {Energetic feedback from star clusters plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamical evolution of giant molecular clouds ({GMCs}). To study the effects of stellar feedback on the star formation efficiency of the clouds and the dynamical response of embedded star clusters, we perform a suite of isolated {GMC} simulations with star formation and momentum feedback subgrid models using the moving-mesh hydrodynamics code {\textbackslash}textsc\{Arepo\}. The properties of our simulated {GMCs} span a wide range of initial mass, radius, and velocity configurations. We find that the ratio of the final stellar mass to the total cloud mass, \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm int\}\$, scales strongly with the initial cloud surface density and momentum feedback strength. This correlation is explained by an analytic model that considers force balancing between gravity and momentum feedback. For all simulated {GMCs}, the stellar density profiles are systematically steeper than that of the gas at the epochs of the peaks of star formation, suggesting a centrally-concentrated stellar distribution. We also find that star clusters are always in a sub-virial state with virial parameter \${\textbackslash}sim0.6\$ prior to gas expulsion. Both the sub-virial dynamical state and steeper stellar density profiles prevent clusters from dispersal during the gas removal phase of their evolution. The final cluster bound fraction is a continuously increasing function of \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm int\}\$. {GMCs} with star formation efficiency smaller than 0.5 are still able to form clusters with large bound fractions.},

We aim to investigate the ionisation conditions and distances of Galactic high-velocity clouds ({HVCs}) in the Galactic halo and beyond in the direction of the Local Group ({LG}) barycentre and anti-barycentre, by studying spectral data of 29 extragalactic background sources obtained with Cosmic Origins Spectropgraph ({COS}) installed on the Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}). Methods. We model column-densities of low, intermediate, and high ions, such as Si {II}, C {II}, Si {III}, Si {IV}, and C {IV} and use this to construct a set of Cloudy ionisation models. Results. In total, we found 69 high-velocity absorption components along the 29 lines of sight. The ones in the direction of the {LG} barycentre span the entire range of studied velocities, 100 {\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbar}v\_\{{LSR}\}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}lesssim 400 km s{\textasciicircum}-1, while the anti-barycentre sample has velocities up to about 300 km s{\textasciicircum}-1. For 49 components, we infer the gas densities. In the direction of the {LG} barycentre, the gas densities exhibit a large range between log n\_H=-3.96 to -2.55, while in the anti-barycentre direction the densities are systematically higher, log n\_H{\textgreater}-3.25. The barycentre absorbers can be split into two groups based on their density: a high density group with log n\_H{\textgreater}-3.54, which can be affected by the Milky Way radiation field, and a low density group (log n\_H {\textbackslash}leq -3.54). The latter has very low thermal pressures of P/k{\textless}7.3 K cm{\textasciicircum}-3. Conclusions. Our study shows that part of the absorbers in the {LG} barycentre direction trace gas at very low gas densities and thermal pressures. Such properties indicate that these absorbers are located beyond the virial radius of the Milky Way. Our study also confirms results from earlier, single-sightline studies, suggesting the presence of a metal-enriched intragroup medium filling the {LG} near its barycentre.},

Here we present the largest catalog to date of galaxy half-mass radii at z {\textgreater} 1: 7,006 galaxies in the {CANDELS} fields at 1.0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5. The sample includes both star-forming and quiescent galaxies with stellar masses 9.0 {\textless} log(M\_* / M\_{\textbackslash}odot) {\textless} 11.5. We test three methods for calculating half-mass radii from multi-band {PSF}-matched {HST} imaging: two based on spatially-resolved {SED} modeling, and one that uses a rest-frame color profile. All three methods agree, with scatter {\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.3 dex. In agreement with previous studies, most galaxies in our sample have negative color gradients (the centers are redder than the outskirts, and r\_e,mass {\textless} r\_e,light). We find that color gradient strength has significant trends with increasing stellar mass, half-light radius, U-V color, and stellar mass surface density. These trends have not been seen before at z{\textgreater}1. Furthermore, color gradients of star-forming and quiescent galaxies show a similar redshift evolution: they are flat at z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}2, then steeply decrease as redshift decreases.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11465},
	abstract = {Theory suggests that there are two primary modes of accretion through which dark matter halos acquire the gas to form and fuel galaxies, hot and cold mode accretion. In cold mode accretion, gas streams along cosmic web filaments to the center of the halo, allowing for the efficient delivery of star-forming fuel. Recently, two {QSO}-illuminated {HI} Lyman alpha (Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}) emitting objects were reported to have properties of cold, rotating structures (Martin et al. 2015, Martin et al. 2016). However, the spatial and spectral resolution available was insufficient to constrain radial flows associated with connecting filaments. With the Keck Cosmic Web Imager ({KCWI}) we now have eight times the spatial resolution, permitting the detection of these in-spiraling flows. In order to detect these inflows, we introduce a suite of models which incorporate zonal radial flows, demonstrate their performance on a numerical simulation that exhibits coldflow accretion, and show that they are an excellent match to {KCWI} velocity maps of two Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} emitters observed around high-redshift quasars. These Multi-Filament Inflow models kinematically isolate zones of radial inflow that correspond to extended filamentary emission. The derived gas flux and inflow path is sufficient to fuel the inferred central galaxy star formation rate and angular momentum. Thus, our kinematic emission maps provide strong evidence for the inflow of gas from the cosmic web building galaxies at the peak of star formation.},

We detect transitions that trace multiple ionization states (e.g. {CaII}, {FeII}, {SiIV}, {CIV}) with column densities that remain constant with height from the disk, indicating that the gas most likely lies within z {\textless} 3.4 kpc. The intermediate ionization state gas traced by {CIV} and {SiIV} is strongly correlated over the full range of transverse separations probed by our sightlines, indicating large, coherent structures greater than 500 pc in size. The low ionization state material traced by {CaII} and {FeII} neither exhibits a correlation with N\_HI nor transverse separation, implying cloudlets or clumpiness on scales less than 10 pc. We find that the observed ratio log(N\_SiIV/ N\_CIV), with a median value of -0.69+/-0.04, is sensitive to the total carbon content of the ionized gas under the assumption of either photoionization or collisional ionization. Our data directly support a physical scenario in which the Milky Way is fed by complex, multiphase processes at its disk-halo interface that involve kpc-scale ionized envelopes or streams containing pc-scale, cool clumps.

	abstract = {In the local Universe, globular clusters ({GCs}) with metallicities \$[\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe\}/\{{\textbackslash}rm H\}]{\textless}-2.5\$ are extremely rare. In this Letter, the close connection between {GC} formation and galaxy evolution is used to show that this {GC} metallicity `floor' results from the galaxy mass-metallicity relation of ultra low-luminosity galaxies ({ULLGs}) at high redshift, where the most metal-poor {GCs} must have formed. Galaxies with metallicities \$[\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe\}/\{{\textbackslash}rm H\}]{\textbackslash}lesssim-2.5\$ have too low masses to form {GCs} with initial masses \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm i\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim10{\textasciicircum}5{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, needed to survive for a Hubble time. This translates the galaxy mass-metallicity relation into a maximum initial cluster mass-metallicity relation for \$[\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe\}/\{{\textbackslash}rm H\}]{\textbackslash}lesssim-1.8\$, which naturally leads to the observed colour-magnitude relation of metal-poor {GCs} at \$z=0\$ (the `blue tilt'). Its strength traces the slope of the gas phase mass-metallicity relation of {ULLGs}. Based on the observed blue tilt of {GCs} in the Virgo and Fornax Clusters, the galaxy mass-metallicity relation is predicted to have a slope of \${\textbackslash}alpha=0.4{\textbackslash}pm0.1\$ for \$10{\textasciicircum}5{\textbackslash}lesssim M\_{\textbackslash}star/\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textbackslash}lesssim10{\textasciicircum}7\$ at \$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim2\$. The {GC} metallicity floor implies a minimum host galaxy mass and a maximum redshift for {GC} formation.

	abstract = {We present new, deep observations of the Phoenix cluster from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the Karl Jansky Very Large Array. These data provide an order of magnitude improvement in depth and/or angular resolution at X-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths, yielding an unprecedented view of the core of the Phoenix cluster. We find that the one-dimensional temperature and entropy profiles are consistent with expectations for pure-cooling hydrodynamic simulations and analytic descriptions of homogeneous, steady-state cooling flow models. In the inner {\textasciitilde}10 kpc, the cooling time is shorter by an order of magnitude than any other known cluster, while the ratio of the cooling time to freefall time approaches unity, signaling that the {ICM} is unable to resist multiphase condensation on kpc scales. When we consider the thermodynamic profiles in two dimensions, we find that the cooling is highly asymmetric. The bulk of the cooling in the inner {\textasciitilde}20 kpc is confined to a low-entropy filament extending northward from the central galaxy. We detect a substantial reservoir of cool (10{\textasciicircum}4 K) gas (as traced by the [{OII}] doublet), which is coincident with the low-entropy filament. The bulk of this cool gas is draped around and behind a pair of X-ray cavities, presumably bubbles that have been inflated by radio jets, which are detected for the first time on kpc scales. These data support a picture in which {AGN} feedback is promoting the formation of a multiphase medium via a combination of ordered buoyant uplift and locally enhanced turbulence. These processes ought to counteract the tendency for buoyancy to suppress condensation, leading to rapid cooling along the jet axis. The recent mechanical outburst has sufficient energy to offset cooling, and appears to be coupling to the {ICM} via a cocoon shock, raising the entropy in the direction orthogonal to the radio jets.},

	abstract = {The excessive dispersion measure ({DM}) of fast radio bursts ({FRBs}) has been proposed to be a powerful tool to study intergalactic medium ({IGM}) and to perform cosmography. One issue is that the fraction of baryons in the {IGM}, \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {IGM}\}\$, is not properly constrained. Here we propose a method of estimating \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {IGM}\}\$ using a putative sample of {FRBs} with the measurements of both {DM} and luminosity distance \$d\_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\}\$. The latter can be obtained if the {FRB} is associated with a distance indicator (e.g. a gamma-ray burst or a gravitational wave event), or the redshift \$z\$ of the {FRB} is measured and \$d\_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\}\$ at the corresponding \$z\$ is available from other distance indicators (e.g. type Ia supernovae) at the same redshift. Since \$d\_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\}/\{{\textbackslash}rm {DM}\}\$ essentially does not depend on cosmological parameters, our method can determine \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {IGM}\}\$ independent of cosmological parameters. We parameterize \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {IGM}\}\$ as a function of redshift and model the {DM} contribution from a host galaxy as a function of star formation rate. Assuming \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {IGM}\}\$ has a mild evolution with redshift with a functional form and by means of Monte Carlo simulations, we show that an unbiased and cosmology-independent estimate of the present value of \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {IGM}\}\$ with a \${\textbackslash}sim 12{\textbackslash}\%\$ uncertainty can be obtained with 50 joint measurements of \$d\_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\}\$ and {DM}. In addition, such a method can also lead to a measurement of the mean value of {DM} contributed from the local host galaxy.},

In a proof-of-principle example with simulated data, we discover that unmodeled sources in the Fermi Bubbles can lead to a dark matter signal being misattributed to point sources by the {NPTF}. We discover striking behavior consistent with a mismodeling effect in the real Fermi data, finding that large artificial injected dark matter signals are completely misattributed to point sources.

	abstract = {We address the origin of the golden mass and time for galaxy formation and the onset of rapid black-hole growth. The preferred dark-halo mass of {\textasciitilde}\$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ is translated to a characteristic epoch, z{\textasciitilde}2, at which the typical forming halos have a comparable mass. We put together a coherent picture based on existing and new simple analytic modeling and cosmological simulations. We describe how the golden mass arises from two physical mechanisms that suppress gas supply and star formation below and above the golden mass, supernova feedback and virial shock heating of the circum-galactic medium ({CGM}), respectively. Cosmological simulations reveal that these mechanisms are responsible for a similar favored mass for the dramatic events of gaseous compaction into compact star-forming "blue nuggets", caused by mergers, counter-rotating streams or other mechanisms. This triggers inside-out quenching of star formation, to be maintained by the hot {CGM}, leading to today's passive early-type galaxies. The blue-nugget phase is responsible for transitions in the galaxy structural, kinematic and compositional properties, e.g., from dark-matter to baryon central dominance and from prolate to oblate shape. The growth of the central black hole is suppressed by supernova feedback below the critical mass, and is free to grow once the halo is massive enough to lock the supernova ejecta by its deep potential well and the hot {CGM}. A compaction near the golden mass makes the black hole sink to the galactic center and triggers a rapid black-hole growth. This ignites feedback by the Active Galactic Nucleus that helps keeping the {CGM} hot and maintaining long-term quenching.},

The galaxies are isolated at \$0.12{\textless}z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gal\}{\textless}0.66\$ and are probed by a background quasar within \$D{\textbackslash}approx 200\$ kpc. Each absorber-galaxy pair has Hubble Space Telescope images and {COS} quasar spectra, and most galaxy redshifts have been accurately measured from Keck/{ESI} spectra. Using the pixel-velocity two-point correlation function ({TPCF}) method, we find that {OVI} absorber kinematics have a strong halo mass dependence. Absorbers hosted by \${\textbackslash}sim L{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ast\}\$ galaxies have the largest velocity dispersions, which we interpret to be that the halo virial temperature closely matches the temperature at which the collisionally ionized {OVI} fraction peaks. Lower mass galaxies and group environments have smaller velocity dispersions. Total column densities follow the same behavior, consistent with theoretical findings. After normalizing out the observed mass dependence, we studied absorber-galaxy kinematics with a modified {TPCF} and found non-virialized motions due to outflowing gas. Edge-on minor axis gas has large optical depths concentrated near the galaxy systemic velocity as expected for bipolar outflows, while face-on minor axis gas has a smoothly decreasing optical depth distribution out to large normalized absorber-galaxy velocities, suggestive of decelerating outflowing gas. Accreting gas signatures are not observed due to "kinematic blurring" in which multiple line-of-sight structures are observed. These results indicate that galaxy mass dominates {OVI} properties over baryon cycle processes.},

Three main results emerge from the X-Shooter spectrum: (a) the Lya has three distinct peaks with the central one at the systemic redshift, indicating a ionised tunnel through which both Lya and {LyC} radiation escape; (b) the large O32 oxygen index ([{OIII}]5007 / [{OII}]3727) of 9.18\_\{-1.32\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.82\} is compatible to those measured in local (z{\textasciitilde}0.4) {LyC} leakers; (c) there are narrow nebular high-ionisation metal lines with {\textbackslash}sigma\_v {\textless} 20 km/s, which confirms the presence of young hot, massive stars.

We also observe that the physical nature of the gaseous halo connects to primary galaxy morphology beyond any relationship to the galaxy's stellar mass and star formation rate. We explore whether the model reproduces behavior related to the central galaxy's stellar mass, star formation rate, and morphology. We find that it is unsuccessful in reproducing the observations at this level of detail and discuss various shortcomings of our simple model that may be responsible.},

We report a high detection rate of up to {\textasciitilde}80\% of galaxies within 1000 km/s from {DLAs} and with impact parameters between 25 and 280 kpc.

The majority of the detections are at relatively large impact parameters ({\textgreater}50 kpc) with two detections being plausible host galaxies. Among our detections, we report four galaxies associated with the most metal-poor {DLA} in our sample (Z/Z\_sun = -2.33), which trace an overdense structure resembling a filament. By comparing our detections with predictions from the Evolution and Assembly of {GaLaxies} and their Environments ({EAGLE}) cosmological simulations and a semi-analytic model designed to reproduce the observed bias of {DLAs} at z{\textgreater}2, we conclude that our observations are consistent with a scenario in which a significant fraction of {DLAs} trace the neutral regions within halos with a characteristic mass of 10{\textasciicircum}11-10{\textasciicircum}12 M\_sun, in agreement with the inference made from the large-scale clustering of {DLAs}.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07274},
	abstract = {We have carried out a controlled comparison of the structural and kinematic properties of the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) around Milky Way mass galaxies in the Illustris and {IllustrisTNG} simulations. Very striking differences are found. At z=0, gas column density and temperature profiles at large radii (\${\textbackslash}sim 100\$ kpc) correlate strongly with disk gas mass fraction in Illustris, but not in {TNG}. The neutral gas at large radii is preferentially aligned in the plane of the disk in {TNG}, whereas it is much more isotropic in Illustris. The vertical coherence scale of the rotationally supported gas in the {CGM} is linked to the gas mass fraction of the galaxy in Illustris, but not in {TNG}. A tracer particle analysis allows us to show how these differences can be understood as a consequence of the different sub-grid models of feedback in the two simulations. A study of spatially matched galaxies in the two simulations shows that in {TNG}, feedback by supernovae and {AGN} helps to create an extended smooth reservoir of hot gas at high redshifts, that then cools to form a thin, rotationally-supported disk at later times. In Illustris, {AGN} dump heat in the form of hot gas bubbles that push diffuse material at large radii out of the halo. The disk is formed by accretion of colder, recycled material, and this results in more vertically extended gas distributions above and below the Galactic plane. We conclude that variations in the structure of gas around Milky Way mass galaxies are a sensitive probe of feedback physics in simulations and are worthy of more observational consideration in future.},

	abstract = {Evidence has increasingly mounted in recent decades that outflows of matter and energy from the central parsecs of our Galaxy have shaped the observed structure of the Milky Way on a variety of larger scales. On scales of {\textasciitilde}15 pc, the Galactic centre has bipolar lobes that can be seen in both X-rays and radio, indicating broadly collimated outflows from the centre, directed perpendicular to the Galactic plane. On far larger scales approaching the size of the Galaxy itself, gamma-ray observations have identified the so-called Fermi Bubble features, implying that our Galactic centre has, or has recently had, a period of active energy release leading to a production of relativistic particles that now populate huge cavities on both sides of the Galactic plane. The X-ray maps from the {ROSAT} all-sky survey show that the edges of these cavities close to the Galactic plane are bright in X-rays. At intermediate scales ({\textasciitilde}150 pc), radio astronomers have found the Galactic Centre Lobe, an apparent bubble of emission seen only at positive Galactic latitudes, but again indicative of energy injection from near the Galactic centre. Here we report the discovery of prominent X-ray structures on these intermediate (hundred-parsec) scales above and below the plane, which appear to connect the Galactic centre region to the Fermi bubbles. We propose that these newly-discovered structures, which we term the Galactic Centre Chimneys, constitute a channel through which energy and mass, injected by a quasi-continuous train of episodic events at the Galactic centre, are transported from the central parsecs to the base of the Fermi bubbles.},

	abstract = {The hosts of long duration gamma-ray bursts are predominantly starburst galaxies at subsolar metallicity. At redshifts z{\textless}1, this implies that most of them are low-mass dwarf galaxies similar to the populations of blue compact dwarfs and dwarf irregulars. What triggers the massive star-formation needed for producing a {GRB} progenitor is still largely unknown, as are the resolved gas properties and kinematics of these galaxies and their formation history. Here we present a sample of six spatially resolved {GRB} hosts at z{\textless}0.3 observed with 3D spectroscopy at high spectral resolution (R=8,000-13,000) using {FLAMES}/{VLT}. We analyze the resolved gas kinematics in the full and the abundances in a subsample. Only two galaxies show a regular disk-like rotation field, two are dispersion dominated and the others have several narrow emission components associated with different parts of the galaxy, which might indicate recent mergers. All galaxies show evidence for broad components underlying the main narrow emission with {FWHM} of 150-300 km/s. This broad component is more metal rich than the narrow components, blueshifted and follows a different velocity structure. We find a weak correlation between the star-formation rate and the {FHWM} of the broad component, its flux relative to the narrow component and the maximum outflow velocity of the gas, but we not find any correlation with the star-formation density, metallicity or stellar mass. We associate this broad component with a metal rich outflow from star-forming regions in the host. The {GRB} is not found at the brightest or most extreme region of the host but is always associated with a star-forming region showing a clear wind component. Our study shows the great potential of 3D spectroscopy to study the star-formation processes in galaxies hosting extreme transients, the need for high S/N and the dangers using un- or only partially resolved data.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05904},
	abstract = {Davies et al. (2019) established that for L{\textasciicircum}* galaxies the fraction of baryons in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) is inversely correlated with the mass of their central supermassive black holes ({BHs}) in the {EAGLE} hydrodynamic simulation. The interpretation is that, over time, a more massive {BH} has provided more energy to transport baryons beyond the virial radius, which additionally reduces gas accretion and star formation. We continue this research by focusing on the relationship between the 1) {BH} masses, 2) physical and observational properties of the {CGM}, and 3) galaxy colours for Milky Way-mass systems. The ratio of the cumulative {BH} feedback energy over the gaseous halo binding energy is a strong predictor of the {CGM} gas content, with {BHs} injecting {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10x the binding energy resulting in gas-poor haloes. Observable tracers of the {CGM}, including {CIV}, {OVI}, and {HI} absorption line measurements, are found to be effective tracers of the total z{\textasciitilde}0 {CGM} halo mass. We use high-cadence simulation outputs to demonstrate that {BH} feedback pushes baryons beyond the virial radius within 100 Myr timescales, but that {CGM} metal tracers take longer (0.5-2.5 Gyr) to respond. Secular evolution of galaxies results in blue, star-forming or red, passive populations depending on the cumulative feedback from {BHs}. The reddest quartile of galaxies with M\_*=10{\textasciicircum}\{10.2-10.7\} M\_solar (median u-r = 2.28) has a {CGM} mass that is 2.5x lower than the bluest quartile (u-r=1.59). We propose strategies for observing the predicted lower {CGM} column densities and covering fractions around galaxies hosting more massive {BHs} using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on Hubble.},

	abstract = {We have used the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer ({MUSE}) to study the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) of a z = 2.92 radio galaxy, {MRC} 0943-242 by parametrising its emitting and absorbing gas. In both Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ \${\textbackslash}lambda\$1216 and He {II} \${\textbackslash}lambda\$1640 lines, we observe emission with velocity shifts of \${\textbackslash}Delta v {\textbackslash}simeq-1000\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ from the systemic redshift of the galaxy. These blueshifted components represent kinematically perturbed gas that is aligned with the radio axis, which we interpret as jet-driven outflows.

With the added sensitivity of this {MUSE} observation, we are more capable of adding constraints to absorber column densities and consequently determining what powers their ionisation. To do this, we obtain photoionisation grid models in {\textbackslash}pkg\{cloudy\} which show that {AGN} radiation is capable of ionising the gas and producing the observed column densities in a gas of metallicity of Z/Z\$\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}simeq\$ 0.01 with a nitrogen abundance a factor of 10 greater than that of hydrogen. This metal-enriched absorbing gas, which is also spatially extended over a projected distance of \$r {\textbackslash}gtrsim 60\$ kpc, is likely to have undergone chemical enrichment through stellar winds that have swept up metals from the interstellar-medium and deposited them in the outer regions of the galaxy's halo.},

	abstract = {We investigate the nature of gas accretion onto haloes and galaxies at z=2 using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations run with the moving mesh code {AREPO}. Implementing a Monte Carlo tracer particle scheme to determine the origin and thermodynamic history of accreting gas, we make quantitative comparisons to an otherwise identical simulation run with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) code {GADGET}-3. Contrasting these two numerical approaches, we find significant physical differences in the thermodynamic history of accreted gas in haloes above 10{\textasciicircum}10.5 solar masses. In agreement with previous work, {GADGET} simulations show a cold fraction near unity for galaxies forming in massive haloes, implying that only a small percentage of accreted gas heats to an appreciable fraction of the virial temperature during accretion. The same galaxies in {AREPO} show a much lower cold fraction, {\textless}20\% in haloes above 10{\textasciicircum}11 solar masses. This results from a hot gas accretion rate which, at this same halo mass, is an order of magnitude larger than with {GADGET}, while the cold accretion rate is also lower. These discrepancies increase for more massive systems, and we explain both as due to numerical inaccuracies in the standard formulation of {SPH}. We also observe that the relatively sharp transition from cold to hot mode dominated accretion, at a halo mass of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}11, is a consequence of comparing past gas temperatures to a constant threshold value independent of virial temperature. Examining the spatial distribution of accreting gas, we find that gas filaments in {GADGET} tend to remain collimated and flow coherently to small radii, or artificially fragment and form a large number of purely numerical "blobs". Similar gas streams in {AREPO} show increased heating and disruption at 0.25-0.5 virial radii and contribute to the hot gas accretion rate in a manner distinct from classical cooling flows.},

The nearby edge-on galaxy {NGC} 891 has a multi-component gaseous halo and a background {AGN} ({LQAC} 035+042 003) projected 5 kpc above the disk near the minor axis. Against the {UV} continuum of this {AGN}, we detect lines from 13 ions associated with {NGC} 891 in new \{{\textbackslash}it {HST}\}/{COS} spectra. Most of the absorption is from the warm ionized gas with \${\textbackslash}log T=4.22{\textbackslash}pm0.04\$, \${\textbackslash}log n\_\{{\textbackslash}rm H\}=-1.26{\textbackslash}pm0.51\$, and \${\textbackslash}log N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm H\}=20.81{\textbackslash}pm 0.20\$.

The absorption system shows the depletion pattern seen for warm Galactic diffuse clouds, which is consistent with a mixture of ejected solar metallicity disk gases and the hot X-ray emitting halo (\$Z=0.1-0.2Z\_{\textbackslash}odot\$). The warm ionized gases are about 5 times more massive than the cold {\textbackslash}ion\{H\}\{1\} emitting gases around the galactic center, which might lead to accretion with a mean rate of \$10{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textbackslash}rm{\textasciitilde}yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for a period of time.

A complete census of star-forming regions in X-rays, combined with well matched infrared ({IR}) data, will advance our understanding of disk survival times and dissipation mechanisms. In addition, we will be able to directly observe the effects of X-ray irradiation on circumstellar grain growth to compare with grain evolution models in both high- and low-{UV} environments. X-rays are native to stars at all phases of star formation and affect planet-forming disks especially through flares. Moreover, X-rays trace magnetic fields which weave through the flares, providing a unique, non-gravitational feedback mechanism between disk and star. Finally, the bright X-ray emission emanating from hot plasma associated with massive stars can have large scale impacts on the topology of star-forming regions and their interface with the interstellar medium ({ISM}).},

	abstract = {In the near future galaxy surveys will target Lyman alpha emitting galaxies ({LAEs}) to unveil the nature of the dark energy. It has been suggested that the observability of {LAEs} is coupled to the large scale properties of the intergalactic medium. Such coupling could introduce distortions into the observed clustering of {LAEs}, adding a new potential difficulty to the interpretation of upcoming surveys. We present a model of {LAEs} that incorporates Lyman-alpha radiative transfer processes in the interstellar and intergalactic medium. The model is implemented in the {GALFORM} semi-analytic model of galaxy of formation and evolution. We find that the radiative transfer inside galaxies produces selection effects over galaxy properties. In particular, observed {LAEs} tend to have low metallicities and intermediate star formation rates. At low redshift we find no evidence of a correlation between the spatial distribution of {LAEs} and the intergalactic medium properties. However, at high redshift the {LAEs} are linked to the line of sight velocity and density gradient of the intergalactic medium. The strength of the coupling depends on the outflow properties of the galaxies and redshift. This effect modifies the clustering of {LAEs} on large scales, adding non linear features. In particular, our model predicts modifications to the shape and position of the baryon acoustic oscillation peak. This work highlights the importance of including radiative transfer physics in the cosmological analysis of {LAEs}.},

The simulations show that the age-metallicity distributions of {GC} populations exhibit strong galaxy-to-galaxy variations, resulting from differences in their evolutionary histories. We develop a formalism for systematically constraining the assembly histories of galaxies using {GC} age-metallicity distributions. These distributions are characterised through 13 metrics that we correlate with 30 quantities describing galaxy formation and assembly (e.g. halo properties, formation/assembly redshifts, stellar mass assembly time-scales, galaxy merger statistics), resulting in 20 statistically (highly) significant correlations. The {GC} age-metallicity distribution is a sensitive probe of the mass growth, metal enrichment, and minor merger history of the host galaxy. No such relation is found between {GCs} and major mergers, which play a sub-dominant role in {GC} formation for Milky Way-mass galaxies. Finally, we show how the {GC} age-metallicity distribution enables the reconstruction of the host galaxy's merger tree, allowing us to identify all progenitors with masses \$M\_*{\textbackslash}gtrsim10{\textasciicircum}8\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ for redshifts \$1{\textbackslash}leq z{\textbackslash}leq2.5\$. These results demonstrate that cosmological simulations of the co-formation and co-evolution of {GCs} and their host galaxies successfully unlock the potential of {GCs} as quantitative tracers of galaxy formation and assembly.},

We examine this connection by performing a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, exploring a range of parameters based on the galaxy formation model developed in Vogelsberger et al. 2013 (henceforth V13). We examine the effects of {AGN} feedback, wind mass loading, wind specific energy, and wind metal-loading on the properties of the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) of galaxies with \$M\_{\textbackslash}text\{halo\} {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. Note that while the V13 model was tuned to match observations including the stellar mass function, no explicit tuning was done for the {CGM}. The wind energy per unit outflow mass has the most significant effect on the {CGM} enrichment. High energy winds launch metals far beyond the virial radius. {AGN} feedback also has a significant effect, but only at \$z {\textless} 3\$. We compare to high redshift {HI} and {CIV} observations. All our simulations produce the observed number of Damped Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ Absorbers. At lower column density, several of our simulations produce enough Lyman Limit Systems ({LLS}) \$100\$ kpc from the galaxy, but in all cases the {LLS} abundance falls off with distance faster than observations, with too few {LLS} at \$200\$ kpc. Further, in all models the {CIV} abundance drops off too sharply with distance, with too little {CIV} \$100\$-\$200\$ kpc from the galaxy. Higher energy wind models produce more extended {CIV} but also produce less stars, in tension with star-formation rate density observations. This highlights the fact that circumgalactic observations are a strong constraint on galactic feedback models.},

These integrators preserve the Poincar{\textbackslash}'\{e\} invariants of Hamiltonian dynamics. The \$N\$-body Hamiltonian has another, perhaps overlooked, symmetry: it is perfectly smooth for particle separations greater than \$0\$. Many popular symplectic integrators, such as hybrid methods or block adaptive stepping methods, do not respect this symmetry and it is perhaps unclear whether they should. We investigate the importance of this symmetry by considering hybrid integrators, whose smoothness can be tuned easily. Hybrid methods are perfectly smooth, except at a finite number of phase space points. We study chaotic planetary orbits in a test considered by Wisdom. We find that increasing smoothness, at negligible extra computational cost in particular tests, improves the Jacobi constant error of the orbits by about \$5\$ orders of magnitude in long-term simulations. The results from this work suggest that smoothness of the \$N\$-body problem is a symmetry worth preserving in simulations.},

	abstract = {Supermassive Black Holes grow at the center of galaxies in consonance with them. In this review we discuss the mass feeding mechanisms that lead to this growth in Active Galactic Nuclei ({AGN}), focusing on constraints derived from observations of their environment, from extragalactic down to galactic and nuclear scales. At high {AGN} luminosities, galaxy mergers and interactions play an important role in {AGN} triggering and feeding. However, gas chaotic cold accretion ({CCA}) in galaxy clusters can trigger radiatively inefficient {AGNs} in brightest cluster galaxies ({BCGs}). At lower luminosities, minor mergers feed {AGN} in early-type, gas-starving galaxies, while secular processes dominate in later-type, gas-rich galaxies. While bars do not appear to directly feed {AGNs}, {AGN} flickering leads to the dissociation of small and large scales, hence affecting the interpretation of cause and effect. At {\textasciitilde} 100 pc scales, recent observations have revealed compact disks and inflows along nuclear gaseous spirals and bars, while {CCA} continues to feed {BCGs} at these scales. Estimated mass inflow rates - of 0.01 to a few Msun/yr - are in many cases thousand times higher than the mass accretion rate to the supermassive black hole. As a result, 10{\textasciicircum}6 - 10{\textasciicircum}9 Msun gas reservoirs can be built on 10{\textasciicircum}\{7-8\} yr, that in turn may lead to the formation of new stars and/or be ejected via the onset of {AGN} feedback.},

These correlations are smooth from sub-Eddington to super-Eddington accretion {AGNs}, probably implying that the {AGN} variability may be caused by the same physical mechanism.},

	abstract = {The role of gas accretion in galaxy evolution is still a matter of debate. The presence of inflows of metal-poor gas that trigger star formation bursts of low metallicity has been proposed as an explanation for the local anti-correlation between star formation rate ({SFR}) and gas-phase metallicity (\${\textbackslash}rm Z\_g\$) found in the literature. In the present study, we show how the anti-correlation is also present as part of a diversified range of behaviours for a sample of more than 700 nearby spiral galaxies from the {SDSS} {IV} {MaNGA} survey. We have characterized the local relation between {SFR} and \${\textbackslash}rm Z\_g\$ after subtracting the azimuthally averaged radial profiles of both quantities. \$60{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the analyzed galaxies display a \${\textbackslash}rm {SFR}-Z\_g\$ anti-correlation, with the remaining \$40{\textbackslash}\%\$ showing no correlation (\$19{\textbackslash}\%\$) or positive correlation (\$21{\textbackslash}\%\$). Applying a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm, we obtain that the slope of the correlation is mainly determined by the average gas-phase metallicity of the galaxy. Galaxy mass, \$g-r\$ colors, stellar age, and mass density seem to play a less significant role. This result is supported by the performed 2nd-order polynomial regression analysis. Thus, the local \${\textbackslash}rm {SFR}-Z\_g\$ slope varies with the average metallicity, with the more metal-poor galaxies presenting the lowest slopes (i.e., the strongest \${\textbackslash}rm {SFR}-Z\_g\$ anti-correlations), and reversing the relation for more metal-rich systems. The dependence seems to flatten in the metal-poor regime, hinting at a single slope for low-metallicity galaxies. Our results suggest that external gas accretion fuels star-formation in metal-poor galaxies, whereas in metal-rich systems the gas comes from previous star formation episodes.},

We use a large, cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation to investigate how this decline is related to the evolution of gas accretion and to outflows driven by active galactic nuclei ({AGN}). We find that the drop in the star formation rate follows a corresponding decline in the global cold-mode accretion rate density onto haloes, but with a delay of order the gas consumption time scale in the interstellar medium. Here we define cold-mode (hot-mode) accretion as gas that is accreted and whose temperature has never exceeded (did exceed) 10{\textasciicircum}5.5 K. In contrast to cold-mode accretion, which peaks at z{\textasciitilde}3, the hot mode continues to increase to z{\textasciitilde}1 and remains roughly constant thereafter. By the present time, the hot mode strongly dominates the global accretion rate onto haloes. Star formation does not track hot-mode halo accretion because most of the hot halo gas never accretes onto galaxies. {AGN} feedback plays a crucial role by preferentially preventing gas that entered haloes in the hot mode from accreting onto their central galaxies. Consequently, in the absence of {AGN} feedback, gas accreted in the hot mode would become the dominant source of fuel for star formation and the drop off in the cosmic star formation rate would be much less steep.},

	abstract = {The formation of Hoag-type galaxies with central spheroidal galaxies and outer stellar rings has yet to be understood in astronomy. We consider that these unique objects were formed from the past interaction between elliptical galaxies and gas-rich dwarf galaxies. We have modelled this potential formation process through simulation. These numerical simulations are a means of investigating this formation hypothesis, however the parameter space to be explored for these simulations is vast. Through the application of machine learning and computational science, we implement a new two-fold method to find the best model parameters for stellar rings in the simulations. First, test particle simulations are run to find a possible range of parameters for which stellar rings can be formed around elliptical galaxies (i.e. Hoag-type galaxies). A novel combination of particle swarm optimisation and Siamese neural networks has been implemented to perform the search over the parameter space and test the level of consistency between observations and simulations for numerous models. Upon the success of this initial step, we subsequently run full chemodynamical simulations for the derived range of model parameters in order to verify the output of the test particle simulations. We successfully find parameter sets at which stellar rings can be formed from the interaction between a gas-rich dwarf galaxy and a central elliptical galaxy. This is evidence that supports our hypothesis about the formation process of Hoag-type galaxies. In addition, this suggests that our new two-fold method has been successfully implemented in this problem search-space and can be investigated further in future applications. {\textasciitilde}},

	abstract = {We study the shape of the gas-phase mass-metallicity relation ({MZR}) of a combined sample of present-day dwarf and high-mass star-forming galaxies using {IZI}, a Bayesian formalism for measuring chemical abundances presented in Blanc et al. 2015. We observe a characteristic stellar mass scale at \$M\_* {\textbackslash}simeq 10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\}\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, above which the {ISM} undergoes a sharp increase in its level of chemical enrichment. In the \$10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\}\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ range the {MZR} follows a shallow power-law (\$Z{\textbackslash}propto M{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\_*\$) with slope \${\textbackslash}alpha=0.14{\textbackslash}pm0.08\$. At approaching \$M\_* {\textbackslash}simeq 10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\}\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ the {MZR} steepens significantly, showing a slope of \${\textbackslash}alpha=0.37{\textbackslash}pm0.08\$ in the \$10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\}\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ range, and a flattening towards a constant metallicity at higher stellar masses. This behavior is qualitatively different from results in the literature that show a single power-law {MZR} towards the low mass end. We thoroughly explore systematic uncertainties in our measurement, and show that the shape of the {MZR} is not induced by sample selection, aperture effects, a changing N/O abundance, the adopted methodology used to construct the {MZR}, secondary dependencies on star formation activity, nor diffuse ionized gas ({DIG}) contamination, but rather on differences in the method used to measure abundances. High resolution hydrodynamical simulations can qualitatively reproduce our result, and suggest a transition in the ability of galaxies to retain their metals for stellar masses above this threshold. The {MZR} characteristic mass scale also coincides with a transition in the scale height and clumpiness of cold gas disks, and a typical gas fraction below which the efficiency of star formation feedback for driving outflows is expected to decrease sharply.},

	abstract = {We introduce the "Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy Formation's Edge" ({EDGE}) project to study the cosmological formation and evolution of the smallest galaxies in the Universe. In this first paper, we explore the effects of resolution and sub-grid physics on a single low mass halo (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), simulated to redshift \$z=0\$ at a mass and spatial resolution of \${\textbackslash}sim 20{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and \${\textbackslash}sim 3\$ pc. We consider different star formation prescriptions, supernova feedback strengths and on-the-fly radiative transfer ({RT}). We show that {RT} changes the mode of galactic self-regulation at this halo mass, suppressing star formation by causing the interstellar and circumgalactic gas to remain predominantly warm (\${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ K) even before cosmic reionisation. By contrast, without {RT}, star formation regulation occurs only through starbursts and their associated vigorous galactic outflows. In spite of this difference, the entire simulation suite (with the exception of models without any feedback) matches observed dwarf galaxy sizes, velocity dispersions, \$V\$-band magnitudes and dynamical mass-to-light-ratios. This is because such structural scaling relations are predominantly set by the host dark matter halo, with the remaining model-to-model variation being smaller than the observational scatter. We find that only the stellar mass-metallicity relation differentiates the galaxy formation models. Explosive feedback ejects more metals from the dwarf, leading to a lower metallicity at a fixed stellar mass. We conclude that the stellar mass-metallicity relation of the very smallest galaxies provides a unique constraint on galaxy formation physics.},

Although it is challenging to observationally determine the outflow velocities, we overcome this challenge by making use of the {ALMA} [{CII}]158 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m emission lines for systemic velocities and the deep Keck spectra with metal absorption lines for velocity profiles available to date. We construct a composite Keck spectrum of the galaxies at \$z=\$5-6 with the [{CII}]-systemic velocities, and fit outflow-line profiles to the {SiII}1260, {CII}1335, and {SiIV}1394,1403 absorption lines in the composite spectrum. We measure the maximum (90\%) outflow velocity \$v\_{\textbackslash}rm\{max\}\$ and the central outflow velocity \$v\_{\textbackslash}rm\{out\}\$ to be \$v\_{\textbackslash}rm\{max\}=810{\textasciicircum}\{+140\}\_\{-160\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm\{km{\textbackslash} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ and \$v\_{\textbackslash}rm\{out\} = 440{\textasciicircum}\{+110\}\_\{-140\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm\{km{\textbackslash} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ on average, respectively.

Estimating the halo circular velocity \$v\_{\textbackslash}rm\{cir\}\$ from the stellar masses and the abundance matching results, we investigate a \$v\_{\textbackslash}rm\{max\}\$-\$v\_{\textbackslash}rm\{cir\}\$ relation. Interestingly, \$v\_{\textbackslash}rm\{max\}\$ for galaxies with \$M\_*=10{\textasciicircum}\{10.0-10.8\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ shows a clear positive correlation with \$v\_{\textbackslash}rm\{cir\}\$ (as well as the star-formation rate) over \$z=\$0-6 with small scatters of \${\textbackslash}simeq {\textbackslash}pm 0.1\$ dex, which is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions (Muratov et al. 2015). This positive correlation suggests that the outflow velocity is physically related to the halo circular velocity corresponding to the depth of the gravitational potential, and that the redshift evolution of \$v\_{\textbackslash}rm\{max\}\$ is explained by the increase of \$v\_{\textbackslash}rm\{cir\}\$ toward high redshift.},

We show that the {ICM} becomes increasingly multiphased at large radii, with the cool-warm gas becoming dominant in cluster outskirts. The diffuse cool-warm gas also exhibits a wider range of metallicity than the hot X-ray emitting gas. We make predictions for the covering fractions of key absorption-line tracers, both in the {ICM} and in the {CGM} of cluster galaxies, typically observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}).

	abstract = {High redshift, massive halos are observed to have sustained, high star formation rates, which require that the amount of cold gas in the halo is continuously replenished. The cooling time scale for the hot virialized halo gas is too long to provide the source of cold gas. Supersonic, cold streams have been invoked as a mechanism for feeding massive halos at high redshift and deliver the cold gas required for continued star formation at the rates observed. This mechanism for replenishing the cold gas reservoir is motivated by some cosmological simulations. However, the cold streams are likely to be subject to the supersonic version of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability ({KHI}), which eventually leads to stream disruption. Cosmological simulations have yet to obtain the spatial resolution required for understanding the detailed stability properties of cold streams. In this paper, we consider instead an idealized model of magnetized cold streams that we spatially resolve. Using linear theory we show how magnetic fields with dynamically important field strengths do not inhibit the {KHI} but rather enhance its growth rate. We perform nonlinear simulations of magnetized stream disruption and find that magnetic fields can nevertheless increase stream survival times by suppressing the mixing rate of cold gas with the circumgalactic medium. We find that magnetic fields can allow streams to survive \${\textbackslash}sim 2-8\$ times longer and, consequently, that streams \${\textbackslash}sim 2-8\$ times thinner can reach the central galaxy if the magnetic field strength is \${\textbackslash}sim 0.3-0.8 {\textbackslash}mu\$G.},

Here we outline several key open questions, briefly discussing the requirements of the observations necessary to make progress, and the relevance of several existing and planned facilities. It is clear that galaxy outflows, and particularly cold outflows, will remain a topic of active research for the next decade and beyond.},

	abstract = {We present {ALMA} rest-frame 230 {GHz} continuum and {CO}(2-1) line observations of the nearby Compton-thick Seyfert galaxy {ESO}428-G14, with angular resolution 0.7 arcsec (78 pc). We detect {CO}(2-1) emission from spiral arms and a circum-nuclear ring with 200 pc radius, and from a transverse gas lane with size of \${\textbackslash}sim100\$ pc, which crosses the nucleus and connects the two portions the circumnuclear ring. The molecular gas in the host galaxy is distributed in a rotating disk with intrinsic circular velocity \$v\_\{rot\}=135\$ km/s, inclination \$i=57\$ deg, and dynamical mass \$M\_\{dyn \}=5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}9{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ within a radius of \${\textbackslash}sim 1\$ kpc. In the inner 100 pc region {CO} is distributed in a equatorial bar, whose kinematics is highly perturbed and consistent with an inflow of gas towards the {AGN}. This inner {CO} bar overlaps with the most obscured, Compton-thick region seen in X-rays. We derive a column density of \${\textbackslash}rm N(H\_2) {\textbackslash}approx 2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{23\}{\textasciitilde} cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ in this region, suggesting that molecular gas may contribute significantly to the {AGN} obscuration. We detect a molecular outflow with a total outflow rate \${\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}dot M\_\{of\}{\textbackslash}approx 0.8{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}/yr\$, distributed along a bi-conical structure with size of \$700\$ pc on both sides of the {AGN}. The bi-conical outflow is also detected in the \${\textbackslash}rm H\_2\$ emission line at 2.12 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m, which traces a warmer nuclear outflow located within 170 pc from the {AGN}. This suggests that the outflow cools with increasing distance from the {AGN}. We find that the hard X-ray emitting nuclear region mapped with Chandra is {CO}-deprived, but filled with warm molecular gas traced by \${\textbackslash}rm H\_2\$ - thus confirming that the hard (3-6 {keV}) continuum and Fe K\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission are due to scattering from dense neutral clouds in the {ISM}.},

	abstract = {We use the {EAGLE} cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to predict the column density and equivalent width distributions of intergalactic O {VII} (\$E=574\$ {eV}) and O {VIII} (\$E=654\$ {eV}) absorbers at low redshift. These two ions are predicted to account for 40\% of the gas-phase oxygen, which implies that they are key tracers of cosmic metals. We find that their column density distributions evolve little at observable column densities from redshift 1 to 0, and that they are sensitive to {AGN} feedback, which strongly reduces the number of strong (column density \$N {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{16\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\})\$ absorbers. The distributions have a break at \$N {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{16\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, corresponding to overdensities of \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$, likely caused by the transition from sheet/filament to halo gas. Absorption systems with \$N {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{16\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ are dominated by collisionally ionized O {VII} and O {VIII}, while the ionization state of oxygen at lower column densities is also influenced by photoionization. At these high column densities, O {VII} and O {VIII} arising in the same structures probe systematically different gas temperatures, meaning their line ratio does not translate into a simple estimate of temperature. While O {VII} and O {VIII} column densities and covering fractions correlate poorly with the H I column density at \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{H {\textbackslash}, I\}\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, O {VII} and O {VIII} column densities are higher in this regime than at the more common, lower H I column densities. The column densities of O {VI} and especially Ne {VIII}, which have strong absorption lines in the {UV}, are good predictors of the strengths of O {VII} and O {VIII} absorption and can hence aid in the detection of the X-ray lines.},

We use a structure finding algorithm we developed to self-consistently parse and follow the evolution of poor clusters, filaments and voids in large scale simulations. We trace the complete evolution of the baryons in the gas phase and the star formation history within each structure in our simulated volume. We vary the structure measure threshold to probe the complex inner structure of star forming regions in poor clusters, filaments and voids. We find the majority of star formation occurs in cold, condensed gas in filaments at intermediate redshifts (z {\textasciitilde} 3). We also show that much of the star formation above a redshift z = 3 occurs in low contrast regions of filaments, but as the density contrast increases at lower redshift star formation switches to the high contrast regions, or inner parts, of filaments. Since filaments bridge the void and cluster regions, it suggests that the majority of star formation occurs in galaxies in intermediate density regions prior to the accretion onto poor clusters. We find that at the present epoch, the gas phase distribution is 43.1\%, 30.0\%, 24.7\% and 2.2\% in the diffuse, {WHIM}, hot halo and condensed phases, respectively. The majority of the {WHIM} is associated with filaments. However, their multiphase nature and the fact that the star formation occurs predominantly in the condensed gas both point to the importance of not conflating the filamentary environment with the {WHIM}. Moreover, in our simulation volume 8.77\%, 79.1\%, 2.11\% of the gas at z = 0 is located in poor clusters, filaments, and voids, respectively. We find that both filaments and poor clusters are multiphase environments distinguishing themselves by different distribution of gas phases.},

	abstract = {We have used the capability of the {MUSE} instrument to explore the impact of stellar feedback at large scales in Haro 11, a galaxy under extreme starburst condition and one of the first galaxies where Lyman continuum ({LyC}) has been detected. Using Ha, [{OIII}] and [{OI}] emission lines from deep {MUSE} observations, we have constructed a sequence of velocity-dependent maps of the Ha emission, the state of the ionised gas and a tracer of fast shocks. These allowed us to investigate the ionisation structure of the galaxy in 50 kms{\textasciicircum}2 bins over a velocity range of -400 to 350 kms. The ionised gas in Haro 11 is assembled by a rich arrangement of structures, such as superbubbles, filaments, arcs and galactic ionised channels, whose appearances change drastically with velocity. The central star forming knots and the star forming dusty arm are the main engines that power the strong mechanical feedback in this galaxy, although with different impact on the ionisation structure. Haro 11 appears to leak {LyC} radiation in many directions. We found evidence of a kpc-scale fragmented superbubble, that may have cleared galactic-scale channels in the {ISM}. Additionally, the southwestern hemisphere is highly ionised in all velocities, hinting at a density bound scenario. A compact kpc-scale structure of lowly ionised gas coincides with the diffuse Lya emission and the presence of fast shocks. Finally, we find evidence that a significant fraction of the ionised gas mass may escape the gravitational potential of the galaxy.},

	abstract = {Energy equipartition between cosmic rays and magnetic fields is often assumed to infer magnetic field properties from the synchrotron observations of star-forming galaxies. However, there is no compelling physical reason to expect the same. We aim to explore the validity of the energy equipartition assumption. After describing popular arguments in favour of the assumption, we first discuss observational results which support it at large scales and how certain observations show significant deviations from equipartition at scales smaller than \${\textbackslash}approx 1 {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm kpc\}\$, probably related to the propagation length of the cosmic rays. Then we test the energy equipartition assumption using test-particle and {MHD} simulations. From the results of the simulations, we find that the energy equipartition assumption is not valid at scales smaller than the driving scale of the {ISM} turbulence (\${\textbackslash}approx 100 {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm pc\}\$ in spiral galaxies), which can be regarded as the lower limit for the scale beyond which equipartition is valid. We suggest that one must be aware of the dynamical scales in the system before assuming energy equipartition to extract magnetic field information from synchrotron observations. Finally, we present ideas for future observations and simulations to investigate in more detail under which conditions the equipartition assumption is valid or not.},

We initially assume fluorescent emission from cold photo-ionized gas confined by the pressure of a hot halo. Acceptable {CGM} baryon fractions (equal or smaller than the cosmological value) require that the cold gas occupies \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$ 1\% of the volume, but is about as massive as the hot gas. {CGM} baryon fractions as low as 30\% of the cosmic value, as predicted by some strongly ejective feedback models at this redshift, are not easy to reconcile with observations, under our assumptions, unless both the {QSO}-hosting haloes at \$z{\textbackslash}sim3\$ are more massive than recent {BOSS} estimates based on clustering and the photo-ionized gas is colder than expected in a standard {QSO} ionizing radiation field. We also consider the option that the emission is dominated by photons scattered from the {QSO} broad line region. In this scenario, a very stringent lower limit to the baryon fraction can be obtained under the extreme assumption of optically thin scattering. We infer in this case a baryon fraction of at least 70\% of the cosmic value, for fiducial parameters. Lower values require halo masses or gas temperatures different than expected, or that some mechanism keeps the cold gas systematically over-pressured with respect to the ambient medium.},

	abstract = {We present a new method of quantifying a galaxy's accretion history from its integrated spectrum alone. Using full spectral fitting and calibrated regularization techniques we show how we can accurately derive a galaxy's mass distribution in age-metallicity space and further separate this into stellar populations from different chemical enrichment histories. By exploiting the fact that accreted lower mass galaxies will exhibit an offset to lower metallicities at fixed age compared to the in-situ stellar population, we quantify the fraction of light that comes from past merger events, that are long since mixed in phase-space and otherwise indistinguishable. Empirical age-metallicity relations ({AMRs}) parameterized for different galaxy masses are used to identify the accreted stellar populations and link them back to the progenitor galaxy's stellar mass. This allows us to not only measure the host galaxy's total ex-situ mass fraction (\$f\_\{acc\}\$), but also quantify the relative amount of accreted material deposited by satellite galaxies of different masses, i.e. the accreted satellite mass function in analogy to the subhalo mass function. Using mock spectra of simulated, present-day galaxies from the {EAGLE} suite we demonstrate that our method can recover the total accreted fraction to within \${\textbackslash}approx 12 {\textbackslash}\%\$, the stellar mass of the most massive accreted subhalo to within \${\textbackslash}approx 26 {\textbackslash}\%\$ and the slope of the accreted satellite mass function to within \${\textbackslash}approx 16 {\textbackslash}\%\$ of the true values from the {EAGLE} merger trees. Future application of this method to observations could potentially provide us accretion histories of hundreds of individual galaxies, for which deep integrated light spectroscopy is available.},

Using Hubble Space Telescope (\${HST}\$) \$H\$-band single-S{\textbackslash}'ersic residual images of \$17\$ {CANDELS} galaxies, we demonstrate the tool's ability to measure the surface brightness and improve the qualitative identification of a variety of common residual features (disk structures, spiral substructures, plausible tidal features, and strong gravitational arcs).

We extract \$H\$-band residual features corresponding to the birth, growth, and fading of tidal features during different stages and viewing orientations at {CANDELS} depths and resolution. We find that the extracted features at shallow depths have noisy visual appearance and are susceptible to viewing angle effects. For a {VELA} \$z{\textbackslash}sim 3\$ major merger, we find that James Webb Space Telescope {NIRCam} observations can probe high-redshift tidal features with considerable advantage over existing \${HST}\$ capabilities.

This is so even though most of the {CGM} in Mh(z = 2) ∼ 5 × 1010 M⊙ haloes first accretes on to the central galaxy before being ejected into the {IGM}. On the other hand, most of the {CGM} mass at z = 0.25 remains in the {CGM} by z = 0 at all halo masses analysed. Of the {CGM} gas that subsequently accretes on to the central galaxy in the progenitors of Mh(z = 0) ∼ 1012 M⊙ haloes, most of it is cool (T ∼ 104 K) at z = 2 but hot (∼Tvir) at z ∼ 0.25, consistent with the expected transition from cold mode to hot mode accretion.

This contrasts strongly with comparatively isolated dwarf galaxies, which are almost all actively star-forming and gas-rich. This near dichotomy implies a rapid transformation of satellite dwarf galaxies after falling into the halos of the {MW} or M31. We combine the observed quiescent fractions for satellites of the {MW} and M31 with the infall times of satellites from the Exploring the Local Volume in Simulations ({ELVIS}) suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations to determine the typical timescales over which environmental processes within the {MW}/M31 halos remove gas and quench star formation in low-mass satellite galaxies. The quenching timescales for satellites with M\_star {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_sun are short, {\textless} 2 Gyr, and quenching is more rapid at lower M\_star. These satellite quenching timescales can be 1 - 2 Gyr longer if one includes the time that satellites were environmentally preprocessed by low-mass groups prior to {MW}/M31 infall. We compare with quenching timescales for more massive satellites from previous works to synthesize the nature of satellite galaxy quenching across the observable range of M\_star = 10{\textasciicircum}\{3-11\} M\_sun. The satellite quenching timescale increases rapidly with satellite M\_star, peaking at {\textasciitilde}9.5 Gyr for M\_star {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_sun, and the timescale rapidly decreases at higher M\_star to {\textless} 5 Gyr at M\_star {\textgreater} 5 x 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_sun. Overall, galaxies with M\_star {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_sun, similar to the Magellanic Clouds, exhibit the longest quenching timescales, regardless of environmental or internal mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The vast majority of dwarf satellites orbiting the Milky Way and M31 are quenched, while comparable galaxies in the field are gas-rich and star-forming. Assuming that this dichotomy is driven by environmental quenching, we use the {ELVIS} suite of N-body simulations to constrain the characteristic timescale upon which satellites must quench following infall into the virial volumes of their hosts. The high satellite quenched fraction observed in the Local Group demands an extremely short quenching timescale ({\textasciitilde} 2 Gyr) for dwarf satellites in the mass range Mstar {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}6-10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun. This quenching timescale is significantly shorter than that required to explain the quenched fraction of more massive satellites ({\textasciitilde} 8 Gyr), both in the Local Group and in more massive host halos, suggesting a dramatic change in the dominant satellite quenching mechanism at Mstar {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun. Combining our work with the results of complementary analyses in the literature, we conclude that the suppression of star formation in massive satellites (Mstar {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}8 - 10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun) is broadly consistent with being driven by starvation, such that the satellite quenching timescale corresponds to the cold gas depletion time. Below a critical stellar mass scale of {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun, however, the required quenching times are much shorter than the expected cold gas depletion times. Instead, quenching must act on a timescale comparable to the dynamical time of the host halo. We posit that ram-pressure stripping can naturally explain this behavior, with the critical mass (of Mstar {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun) corresponding to halos with gravitational restoring forces that are too weak to overcome the drag force encountered when moving through an extended, hot circumgalactic medium.},

	abstract = {We discuss cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation performed with the new moving-mesh code {AREPO}, which promises higher accuracy compared with the traditional {SPH} technique that has been widely employed for this problem. We use an identical set of physics in corresponding simulations carried out with the well-tested {SPH} code {GADGET}, adopting also the same high-resolution gravity solver. We are thus able to compare both simulation sets on an object-by-object basis, allowing us to cleanly isolate the impact of different hydrodynamical methods on galaxy and halo properties. In accompanying papers, we focus on an analysis of the global baryonic statistics predicted by the simulation codes, (Vogelsberger et al. 2011) and complementary idealized simulations that highlight the differences between the hydrodynamical schemes (Sijacki et al. 2011). Here we investigate their influence on the baryonic properties of simulated galaxies and their surrounding haloes. We find that {AREPO} leads to significantly higher star formation rates for galaxies in massive haloes and to more extended gaseous disks in galaxies, which also feature a thinner and smoother morphology than their {GADGET} counterparts. Consequently, galaxies formed in {AREPO} have larger sizes and higher specific angular momentum than their {SPH} correspondents. The more efficient cooling flows in {AREPO} yield higher densities and lower entropies in halo centers (and the opposite trend in halo outskirts) leading to higher star formation rates of massive galaxies. While both codes agree to acceptable accuracy on a number of baryonic properties of cosmic structures, our results clearly demonstrate that galaxy formation simulations greatly benefit from the use of more accurate hydrodynamical techniques such as {AREPO}.},

Archival {HI} measurements of 47 targets are combined with new Arecibo observations of a further 51 galaxies. The stellar mass range of the post-merger sample, our observing strategy, detection thresholds and data analysis procedures replicate those of the extended {GALEX} Arecibo {SDSS} Survey ({xGASS}) which can therefore be used as a control sample. Our principal results are: 1) The post-merger sample shows a {\textasciitilde}50 per cent higher {HI} detection fraction compared with {xGASS}; 2) Accounting for non-detections, the median atomic gas fraction of the post-merger sample is larger than the control sample by 0.3 -- 0.6 dex; 3) The median atomic gas fraction enhancement (delta fgas), computed on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis at fixed stellar mass, is 0.51 dex. Our results demonstrate that recently merged galaxies are typically a factor of {\textasciitilde}3 more {HI} rich than control galaxies of the same M*. If the control sample is additionally matched in star formation rate, the median {HI} excess is reduced to delta fgas = 0.2 dex, showing that the enhanced atomic gas fractions in post-mergers are not purely a reflection of changes in star formation activity. We conclude that merger-induced starbursts and outflows do not lead to prompt quenching via exhaustion/expulsion of the galactic gas reservoirs. Instead, we propose that if star formation ceases after a merger, it is more likely due to an enhanced turbulence which renders the galaxy unable to effectively form new stars.},

The feedback is jet-driven with an energy determined by the amount of cold gas within 500 pc of the {SMBH}. When the intra-cluster medium ({ICM}) in the core of the cluster becomes marginally stable to radiative cooling, with the thermal instability to the free-fall timescale ratio t\_\{{TI}\}/t\_\{ff\} {\textless} 3-10, cold clumps of gas start to form along the propagation direction of the {AGN} jets. By tracing the particles in the simulations, we find that these cold clumps originate from low entropy (but still hot) gas that is accelerated by the jet to outward radial velocities of a few hundred km/s. This gas is out of hydrostatic equilibrium and so can cool. The clumps then grow larger as they decelerate and fall towards the center of the cluster, eventually being accreted onto the super-massive black hole. The general morphology, spatial distribution and estimated H\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} morphology of the clumps are in reasonable agreement with observations, although we do not fully replicate the filamentary morphology of the clumps seen in the observations, probably due to missing physics.},

The issue can be broken down into two distinct questions: 1) Can galaxy mergers trigger {AGN}? 2) Are galaxy mergers the dominant {AGN} triggering mechanism? A complete picture of the {AGN}-merger connection requires that both of these questions are addressed with the same dataset. In previous work, we have shown that galaxy mergers selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS}) show an excess of both optically-selected, and mid-{IR} colour-selected {AGN}, demonstrating that the answer to the first of the above questions is affirmative. Here, we use the same optical and mid-{IR} {AGN} selection to address the second question, by quantifying the frequency of morphological disturbances in low surface brightness r-band images from the Canada France Imaging Survey ({CFIS}). Only {\textasciitilde}30 per cent of optical {AGN} host galaxies are morphologically disturbed, indicating that recent interactions are not the dominant trigger. However, almost 60 per cent of mid-{IR} {AGN} hosts show signs of visual disturbance, indicating that interactions play a more significant role in nuclear feeding. Both mid-{IR} and optically selected {AGN} have interacting fractions that are a factor of two greater than a mass and redshift matched non-{AGN} control sample, an excess that increases with both {AGN} luminosity and host galaxy stellar mass.},

The post-mergers also show a stronger deficit in gas phase metallicity than the closest pairs, being more metal-poor than their control by -0.09 dex. Combined with the observed trends in {SFR} and the timescales predicted in merger simulations, we estimate that the post-mergers in our sample have undergone coalescence within the last few hundred Myr. In contrast with the incidence of star-forming galaxies, the frequency of active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) peaks in the post-mergers, outnumbering {AGN} in the control sample by a factor of 3.75. Moreover, amongst the galaxies that host an {AGN}, the black hole accretion rates in the closest pairs and post-mergers are higher by a factor of {\textasciitilde}3 than {AGN} in the control sample. These results are consistent with a picture in which star formation is initiated early on in the encounter, with {AGN} activity peaking post-coalescence.},

Using {\textasciitilde}487,000 spaxels from galaxies observed as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Mapping Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory ({MaNGA}) survey, we confirm previous results that a correlation also exists between the surface densities of star formation (Sigma\_SFR) and stellar mass (Sigma\_mass) on kpc scales, representing a `resolved' main sequence. Using a new metric (Delta Sigma\_SFR), which measures the relative enhancement or deficit of star formation on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis relative to the resolved main sequence, we investigate the {SFR} profiles of 864 galaxies as a function of their position relative to the global star forming main sequence (Delta {SFR}). For galaxies above the global main sequence (positive Delta {SFR}) Delta Sigma\_SFR is elevated throughout the galaxy, but the greatest enhancement in star formation occurs at small radii ({\textless} 3 kpc, or 0.5 R\_e). Moreover, galaxies that are at least a factor of three above the main sequence show diluted gas phase metallicities out to 2 R\_e, indicative of metal-poor gas inflows accompanying the starbursts. For quiescent/passive galaxies that lie at least a factor of 10 below the star forming main sequence there is an analogous deficit of star formation throughout the galaxy with the lowest values of Delta Sigma\_SFR in the central 3 kpc. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the `compaction' scenario in which a central starburst leads to mass growth in the bulge and may ultimately precede galactic quenching from the inside-out.},

We derive the age, [Fe/H], and [Mg/Fe] for each individual galaxy using a full-spectrum fitting technique. By comparing with the relations for \$z{\textbackslash}sim0\$ {SDSS} galaxies, we confirm our previous finding that the mass-[Fe/H] relation evolves with redshift. The mass-[Fe/H] relation at higher redshift has lower normalization and possibly steeper slope. However, based on our sample, the mass-[Mg/H] relation does not evolve over the observed redshift range. We use a simple analytic chemical evolution model to constrain average outflow that these galaxies experience over their lifetime, via the calculation of mass-loading factor. We find that the average mass-loading factor \${\textbackslash}eta\$ is a power-law function of galaxy stellar mass, \${\textbackslash}eta {\textbackslash}propto M\_*{\textasciicircum}\{-0.21{\textbackslash}pm0.09\}\$.

We present a deep redshift survey in the field of 1ES1553+113, a blazar with a unique combination of {UV}+X-ray spectra for surveys of the circum-/intergalactic medium ({CGM}/{IGM}). Nicastro et al. 2018 reported the detection of two O {VII} {WHIM} absorbers at \$z=0.4339\$ and \$0.3551\$ in its spectrum, suggesting that the {WHIM} is metal-rich and sufficient to close the missing baryons problem. Our survey indicates that the blazar is a member of a \$z=0.433\$ group and that the higher-\$z\$ O {VII} candidate arises from its intragroup medium. The resulting bias precludes its use in baryon censuses. The \$z=0.3551\$ candidate occurs in an isolated environment 630 kpc from the nearest galaxy (with stellar mass \${\textbackslash}log M\_*/M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}approx 9.7\$) which we show is unexpected for the {WHIM}. Finally, we characterize the galactic environments of broad H I Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ absorbers (Doppler widths of \$b=40-80\$ {\textbackslash}kms; \$T{\textbackslash}lesssim4{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}5\$ K) which provide metallicity independent {WHIM} probes.

While this gas is directly observable in X-ray emission around clusters of galaxies, it is primarily studied through its {UV} absorption. Recently, X-ray observations of large-scale filaments connecting to the cosmic web around the nearby (\$z=0.05584\$) cluster Abell 133 were reported. One of these filaments is intersected by the sightline to quasar [{VV}98] J010250.2\$-\$220929, allowing for a first-ever census of cold, cool, and warm gas in a filament of the cosmic web where hot gas has been seen in X-ray emission. Here, we present {UV} observations with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and optical observations with the Magellan Echellette spectrograph of [{VV}98] J010250.2\$-\$220929. We find no evidence of cold, cool, or warm gas associated with the filament.

As this sightline is \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}1100{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}textrm\{pkpc\}\$ (\$0.7R\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{vir\}\$) from the center of Abell 133, we suggest that all gas in the filament is hot at this location, or that any warm, cool, or cold components are small and clumpy. A broader census of this system -- combining more {UV} sightlines, deeper X-ray observations, and a larger redshift catalog of cluster members -- is needed to better understand the roles of filaments around clusters.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07976},
	abstract = {Over the last decades, cosmological simulations of galaxy formation have been instrumental for advancing our understanding of structure and galaxy formation in the Universe. These simulations follow the non-linear evolution of galaxies modeling a variety of physical processes over an enormous range of scales. A better understanding of the physics relevant for shaping galaxies, improved numerical methods, and increased computing power have led to simulations that can reproduce a large number of observed galaxy properties. Modern simulations model dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter in an expanding space-time starting from well-defined initial conditions. The modeling of ordinary matter is most challenging due to the large array of physical processes affecting this matter component. Cosmological simulations have also proven useful to study alternative cosmological models and their impact on the galaxy population. This review presents a concise overview of the methodology of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and their different applications.},

	abstract = {We revisit the question of ‘hot mode’ versus ‘cold mode’ accretion on to galaxies using steady-state cooling flow solutions and idealized 3D hydrodynamic simulations. We demonstrate that for the hot accretion mode to exist, the cooling time is required to be longer than the free-fall time near the radius where the gas is rotationally supported, Rcirc, i.e. the existence of the hot mode depends on physical conditions at the galaxy scale rather than on physical conditions at the halo scale. When allowing for the depletion of the halo baryon fraction relative to the cosmic mean, the longer cooling times imply that a virialized gaseous halo may form in halo masses below the threshold of \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}\$ derived for baryon-complete haloes. We show that for any halo mass there is a maximum accretion rate for which the gas is virialized throughout the halo and can accrete via the hot mode of \$\{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm crit\}{\textbackslash}approx 0.7(v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm c\}/100{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm km{\textbackslash} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}){\textasciicircum}\{5.4\}(R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm circ\}/10{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm kpc\})(Z/{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm Z\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}){\textasciicircum}\{-0.9\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, where Z and vc are the metallicity and circular velocity measured at Rcirc. For accretion rates \${\textbackslash}gtrsim \{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm crit\}\$ the volume-filling gas phase can in principle be ‘transonic’ – virialized in the outer halo but cool and free-falling near the galaxy. We compare \$\{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm crit\}\$ to the average star formation rate ({SFR}) in haloes at 0 \&lt; z \&lt; 10 implied by the stellar-mass–halo-mass relation.

	abstract = {Radio, X-ray and infrared observations of the inner few hundred pc of the Galactic center have highlighted two characteristics to the {ISM}. The cosmic ray ionization rate derived from molecular ions such as H\${\textasciicircum}+\_3\$, is at least two to three orders of magnitudes higher than in the Galactic disk. The other is bipolar X-ray and radio emission away from the Galactic plane. These features are consistent with a scenario in which high cosmic ray pressure drives large-scale winds away from the Galactic plane. The interaction of such a wind with stellar wind bubbles may explain the energetic nonthermal radio filaments found throughout the Galactic center. Some of the implications of this scenario is the removal of gas driven by outflowing winds, acting as a feedback to reduce the star formation rate in the central molecular zone ({CMZ}), and the distortion of azimuthal magnetic field lines in the {CMZ} to vertical direction away from the plane. The combined effects of the wind and vertical magnetic field can explain why most magnetized filaments run perpendicular to the Galactic plane. This proposed picture suggests our Milky Way nucleus has recently experienced starburst or black hole activity, as recent radio and X-ray observations indicate.},

In order to extract the Galactic halo component from the diffuse soft X-ray emission spectrum, accurately modeling the foreground components is crucial. Here we present complex modeling of the foregrounds with unprecedented details. A careful analysis of the spectrum yields two temperature components of the halo gas (T\${\textasciicircum}\{em\}\_1\$= 10\${\textasciicircum}\{6.32\}\$K, T\${\textasciicircum}\{em\}\_2\$= 10\${\textasciicircum}\{6.82\}\$K).

This provides us with interesting insights into the nature of emitting and absorbing systems. We discuss several possibilities objectively, and conclude that most likely we are observing multiple (3 to 4) discrete temperatures between 10\${\textasciicircum}\{5.5\}\$K and \${\textbackslash}geqslant\$10\${\textasciicircum}7\$K.},

At first, by numerical simulations we demonstrate the growing effect of self-gravity on interstellar clouds and, by this, moreover argue against their initial setup as homogeneous. We apply the adaptive-mesh refinement code \{{\textbackslash}sc Flash\} with extensions to metal-dependent radiative cooling and external heating of the gas, self-gravity, mass diffusion, and semi-analytic dissociation of molecules and ionization of atoms. We show that the criterion of Jeans mass or Bonnor-Ebert mass, respectively, provides only a sufficient but not a necessary condition for self-gravity to be effective, because even low-mass clouds are affected on reasonable dynamical timescales. The second part of this paper is dedicated to analytically study the reduction of heat conduction by a magnetic dipole field.We demonstrate that in this configuration, the effective heat flow, i.e. integrated over the cloud surface, is suppressed by only \$32\$ per cent by magnetic fields in energy equipartition and still insignificantly for even higher field strengths.},

These calculations are conducted by transforming the {HVC} velocities into the Galactic Standard of Rest ({GSR}) reference frame, identifying inflowing (v\_GSR {\textless} 0 km/s) and outflowing (v\_GSR {\textgreater} 0 km/s) populations, and using observational constraints on the distance, metallicity, dust content, covering fractions, and total hydrogen column density of each population. After removing {HVCs} associated with the Magellanic Stream and the Fermi Bubbles, we find inflow and outflow rates in cool (T{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}4 K) ionized gas of {dM}\_in/dt {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 0.53+/-0.17 (d/12 kpc) (Z/0.2 Z\_sun){\textasciicircum}-1 M\_sun/yr and {dM}\_out/dt {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 0.16+/-0.06 (d/12 kpc) (Z/0.5 Z\_sun){\textasciicircum}-1 M\_sun/yr. The excess of inflowing over outflowing gas suggests that the Milky Way is currently in an inflow-dominated phase, but the presence of substantial mass flux in both directions supports a Galactic fountain model, in which gas is constantly recycled between the disk and the halo. We also find that the metal flux in both directions (in and out) is indistinguishable. By comparing the outflow rate to the Galactic star formation rate, we present the first estimate of the mass loading factor (etc\_HVC) of the disk-wide Milky Way wind, finding eta\_HVC {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 0.10+/-0.06 (d/12 kpc) (Z/0.5 Z\_sun){\textasciicircum}-1.

We analyze an {HST}/{COS} archival spectrum of a quasar sightline ({PHL}2525), which is 45 kpc (0.5 virial radius) from {WLM} and close to the Magellanic Stream ({MS}). Along this sightline, two ion absorbers are detected in Si {II}, Si {III}, Si {IV}, C {II}, and C {IV} at velocities of \${\textbackslash}sim\$-220 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ (Component v-220) and \${\textbackslash}sim\$-150 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ (Component v-150). To identify their origins, we study the position-velocity alignment of the components with {WLM} and the nearby {MS}. Near the Magellanic longitude of {PHL}2525, the {MS}-related neutral and ionized gas moves at \${\textbackslash}lesssim-190\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, suggesting an {MS} origin for Component v-220, but not for Component v-150. Because {PHL}2525 passes near {WLM} and Component v-150 is close to {WLM}'s systemic velocity (\${\textbackslash}sim\$-132 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$), it is likely that Component v-150 arises from the galaxy's {CGM}.

	abstract = {The rotational kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich ({rkSZ}) signal, imprinted on the cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) by the gaseous halos of foreground galaxies, would be a novel probe of galaxy formation. Although the signal is too weak to detect in individual galaxies, we analyze the feasibility of its statistical detection via stacking {CMB} data on many galaxies for which the spin orientation can be estimated spectroscopically. We use an "optimistic" model, in which fully ionized atmospheres contain the cosmic baryon fraction and spin at the halo's circular velocity \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm circ\}\$, and a more realistic model, with multi-phase atmospheres spinning at a fraction of \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm circ\}\$. We incorporate realistic noise estimates into our analysis. Using low-redshift galaxy properties from the {MaNGA} spectroscopic survey (with median halo mass of \$6.6{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$), and {CMB} data quality from Planck, we find that a \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ detection would require \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}6\$ galaxies. This is too high for current surveys, but higher-angular resolution future {CMB} experiments will significantly reduce the requirements: stacking {CMB} data on galaxy spins in a few\${\textbackslash}times10\$ deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ can rule out the optimistic models, and \${\textbackslash}approx\$1,300 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ will suffice for a \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ detection with {CMB}-S4 experiments. As a proof-of-concept, we stacked Planck data on the position of \${\textbackslash}approx2,000\$ {MaNGA} galaxies. We rule out average temperature dipoles larger than \${\textbackslash}approx5.7 {\textbackslash}mu\$K. Restricted to spiral galaxies outside clusters, we find a hint of a temperature dipole of 2.3\$ {\textbackslash}mu\$K (at \${\textbackslash}approx2{\textbackslash}sigma\$). This value is two orders of magnitude larger than the expected {rkSZ} signal, but if the detection is confirmed in future data to be real, it could be explained by Doppler-shifted emission from dust that is kinematically coupled to the gas.},

Fitting a gas-regulator model to the spaxel data, we are able to account for variations in the local gas fraction, stellar mass surface density and local escape velocity-dependent outflows. We find that the best explanation for the metallicity differences is the variation in the average metallicity of accreted gas between different environments that depends on the stellar mass of the dominant galaxies in each halo.

This multi-epoch abundance matching ({MEAM}) model self-consistently takes into account that satellite galaxies first become satellites at times earlier than they are observed. We employ a redshift-dependent parameterization of the stellar-to-halo mass relation to populate haloes and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with galaxies, requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at several redshifts be reproduced simultaneously. Using merger trees extracted from the dark matter simulations in combination with {MEAM}, we predict the average assembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within the galaxies (in-situ) and accretion of stars (ex-situ). The peak star formation efficiency decreases with redshift from 23\% at z=0 to 9\% at z=4 while the corresponding halo mass increases from 10{\textasciicircum}11.8M{\textbackslash}odot to 10{\textasciicircum}12.5M{\textbackslash}odot. The star formation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halo mass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-mass galaxies the peak has not been reached yet. In haloes similar to that of the Milky-Way about half of the central stellar mass is assembled after z=0.7. In low-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly of their central galaxies, while in massive haloes more than half of the central stellar mass is formed ex-situ with significant accretion of satellites at z{\textless}2. We find that our method implies a cosmic star formation history and an evolution of specific star formation rates which are consistent with those inferred directly. We present convenient fitting functions for stellar masses, star formation rates, and accretion rates as functions of halo mass and redshift.},

The galaxies were divided into three subsamples, with mean redshifts z=1.7, 2.2, 2.9, according to the {UGR} selection criteria of Adelberger et al. (2004) and Steidel et al. (2003). Combining the galaxies' measured angular clustering with redshift distributions inferred from 1600 spectroscopic redshifts, we find comoving correlation lengths at the three redshifts of r\_0 = 4.5+-0.6, 4.2+-0.5, and 4.0+-0.6 h{\textasciicircum}-1 Mpc, respectively, and infer a roughly constant correlation function slope of gamma=1.6+-0.1. We derive similar numbers from the 1600 object spectroscopic sample itself with a new statistic, K, that is insensitive to many possible systematics. Galaxies that are bright in R (lambda\_rest {\textasciitilde} 1500-2500A) cluster more strongly than fainter galaxies at z=2.9 and z=2.2 but not, apparently, at z=1.7. Comparison to a numerical simulation that is consistent with recent {WMAP} observations suggests that galaxies in our samples are associated with dark matter halos of mass {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}12, and that a small fraction of the halos contain more than one galaxy that satisfies our selection criteria. Adding recent observations of galaxy clustering at z{\textasciitilde}0 and z{\textasciitilde}1 to the simulation results, we conclude that the typical object in our samples will evolve into an elliptical galaxy by redshift z=0 and will already have an early-type spectrum by redshift z=1.

	abstract = {We investigate the impact of cosmic rays ({CRs}) on the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) in {FIRE}-2 simulations, for ultra-faint dwarf through Milky Way ({MW})-mass haloes hosting star-forming ({SF}) galaxies. Our {CR} treatment includes injection by supernovae, anisotropic streaming and diffusion along magnetic field lines, and collisional and streaming losses, with constant parallel diffusivity \${\textbackslash}kappa {\textbackslash}sim 3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{29\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ chosen to match γ-ray observations. With this, {CRs} become more important at larger halo masses and lower redshifts, and dominate the pressure in the {CGM} in {MW}-mass haloes at z ≲ 1–2. The gas in these ‘{CR}-dominated’ haloes differs significantly from runs without {CRs}: the gas is primarily cool (a few \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}10{\textasciicircum}\{4\}{\textbackslash},\$ K), and the cool phase is volume-filling and has a thermal pressure below that needed for virial or local thermal pressure balance. Ionization of the ‘low’ and ‘mid’ ions in this diffuse cool gas is dominated by photoionization, with O vi columns \$\{{\textbackslash}gtrsim\}10{\textasciicircum}\{14.5\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\}\$ at distances \$\{{\textbackslash}gtrsim\}150{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$. {CR} and thermal gas pressure are locally anticorrelated, maintaining total pressure balance, and the {CGM} gas density profile is determined by the balance of {CR} pressure gradients and gravity. Neglecting {CRs}, the same haloes are primarily warm/hot (\$T{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{5\}{\textbackslash},\$K) with thermal pressure balancing gravity, collisional ionization dominates, O vi columns are lower and Ne viii higher, and the cool phase is confined to dense filaments in local thermal pressure equilibrium with the hot phase.},

	abstract = {We present a systematic study of the extraplanar gas ({EPG}) in a sample of 15 nearby late-type galaxies at intermediate inclinations using publicly available, deep interferometric {HI} data from the {HALOGAS} survey. For each system we mask the {HI} emission coming from the regularly rotating disc and use synthetic datacubes to model the leftover "anomalous" {HI} flux. Our model consists of a smooth, axisymmetric thick component described by 3 structural and 4 kinematical parameters, which are fit to the data via a Bayesian {MCMC} approach. We find that extraplanar {HI} is nearly ubiquitous in disc galaxies, as we fail to detect it in only two of the systems with the poorest spatial resolution. The {EPG} component encloses {\textasciitilde}5-25\% of the total {HI} mass, with a mean value of 14\%, and has a typical thickness of a few kpc, incompatible with expectations based on hydrostatic equilibrium models. The {EPG} kinematics is remarkably similar throughout the sample, and consists of a lagging rotation with typical vertical gradients of about -10 km/s/kpc, a velocity dispersion of 15-30 km/s and, for most galaxies, a global inflow in both the vertical and radial directions with speeds of 20-30 km/s. The {EPG} {HI} masses are in excellent agreement with predictions from simple models of the galactic fountain powered by stellar feedback. The combined effect of photo-ionisation and interaction of the fountain material with the circumgalactic medium can qualitatively explain the kinematics of the {EPG}, but dynamical models of the galactic fountain are required to fully test this framework.},

	abstract = {(abridged) The far-{UV} wavelength range (912-2000A) provides access to atomic and molecular transitions of many species the interstellar medium ({ISM}), circumgalactic medium ({CGM}), and intergalactic medium, within phases spanning a wide range of ionization, density, temperature, and molecular gas fraction. Far-{UV} space telescopes have enabled detailed studies of the {ISM} in the Milky Way thanks to absorption features appearing in the {UV} spectra of hot stars and yielding fundamental insights into the composition and physical characteristics of all phases of the {ISM} along with the processes that influence them. However, we have yet to design a spectrometer able to observe the full {UV} domain at resolving power R{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}5 with a signal-to-noise ratio {SNR}{\textgreater}500. Such a resolution is necessary to resolve lines from both the cold molecular hydrogen and the warm metal ions with a turbulent velocity of about 1 km s-1, and to differentiate distinct velocity components. Future {UV} spectroscopic studies of the Milky Way {ISM} must revolutionize our understanding of the {ISM} as a dynamical, unstable, and magnetized medium, and rise to the challenge brought forward by current theories. Another interesting prospect is to transpose the same level of details that has been reached for the Milky Way to the {ISM} in external galaxies, in particular in metal-poor galaxies, where the {ISM} chemical composition, physical conditions, and topology change dramatically, with significant consequences on the star-formation properties. Finally, we need to be able to perform statistical analyses of background quasar lines of sight intersecting the {CGM} of galaxies at various redshifts and to comprehend the role of gas exchanges and flows for galaxy evolution.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03076},
	abstract = {The redshift range z=4-6 marks a transition phase between primordial and mature galaxy formation in which galaxies considerably increase their stellar mass, metallicity, and dust content. The study of galaxies in this redshift range is therefore important to understand early galaxy formation and the fate of galaxies at later times. Here, we investigate the burstiness of the recent star-formation history ({SFH}) of 221 \$z{\textbackslash}sim4.5\$ main-sequence galaxies at log(M) {\textgreater} 9.7 by comparing their ultra-violet ({UV}) continuum, H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosity, and H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ equivalent-width ({EW}). The H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ properties are derived from the Spitzer [3.6\${\textbackslash}mu\$m]-[4.5\${\textbackslash}mu\$m] broad-band color, thereby properly taking into account model and photometric uncertainties. We find a significant scatter between H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and {UV}-derived luminosities and star-formation rates ({SFRs}). About half of the galaxies show a significant excess in H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ compared to expectations from a constant smooth {SFH}. We also find a tentative anti-correlation between H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ {EW} and stellar mass, ranging from 1000\${\textbackslash}r\{A\}\$ at log(M) {\textless} 10 to below 100\${\textbackslash}r\{A\}\$ at log(M) {\textgreater} 11. Consulting models suggests that most \$z{\textbackslash}sim4.5\$ galaxies had a burst of star-formation within the last 50 Myrs, increasing their {SFRs} by a factor of {\textgreater} 5. The most massive galaxies on the other hand might decrease their {SFRs}, and may be transitioning to a quiescent stage by z=4. We identify differential dust attenuation (f) between stars and nebular regions as the main contributor to the uncertainty. With local galaxies selected by increasing H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ {EW} (reaching values similar to high-z galaxies), we predict that f approaches unity at \$z{\textgreater}4\$ consistent with the extrapolation of measurements out to z=2.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02632},
	abstract = {We explore the survival and lifetimes of cool clouds in multi-phase circum-galactic medium. We revisit the "cloud crushing problem" in a large survey of numerical simulations including radiative cooling and heating, ionization and self-shielding, self-gravity, magnetic fields, and anisotropic Braginskii conduction and viscosity. We explore a wide range of parameters as well as a variety of magnetic field strengths and geometries and initial cloud turbulence. For realistic magnetic field and internal turbulence strengths in "full physics" 3D simulations, magnetic fields and turbulence have relatively weak effects on cloud survival; the most important physics is radiative cooling and conduction. Self-gravity and self-shielding are important for clouds which are initially Jeans unstable, but largely irrelevant otherwise. Non-self-gravitating, realistically magnetized clouds separate into four regimes: (1) At low column densities, clouds evaporate rapidly via conduction. (2) A "failed pressure confinement" regime, where the ambient hot gas cools faster than the cloud-crossing time and fails to provide pressure confinement for the cloud. (3) An "infinitely long-lived" regime, in which the cloud lifetime becomes longer than the cooling time of gas swept up in the leading bow shock, so the cloud begins to accrete and grow. (4) A "classical cloud destruction" regime, where clouds are eventually destroyed by instabilities. In the final regime, the cloud lifetime can exceed the naive cloud-crushing time, as initial conduction produces rapid evaporation off the surface which compresses clouds into denser configurations than implied by simple two-phase pressure equilibrium. However, it is also possible that small and/or slow-moving clouds evaporate more rapidly than the cloud-crushing time. We develop simple analytic models that explain the simulated cloud destruction times in this regime.},

	abstract = {We examine the growth of the stellar content of galaxies from z= 3 → 0 in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations incorporating parametrized galactic outflows. Without outflows, galaxies overproduce stellar masses (M*) and star formation rates ({SFRs}) compared to observations. Winds introduce a three-tier form for the galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate functions, where the middle tier depends on the differential (i.e. mass-dependent) recycling of ejected wind material back into galaxies. A tight M*-{SFR} relation is a generic outcome of all these simulations and its evolution is well described as being powered by cold accretion, although current observations at z≳ 2 suggest that the star formation in small early galaxies must be highly suppressed. Roughly, one-third of z= 0 galaxies at masses below M★ are satellites and the star formation in satellites is not much burstier than in centrals. All models fail to suppress the star formation and stellar mass growth in massive galaxies at z≲ 2, indicating the need for an external quenching mechanism such as black hole feedback. All models also fail to produce dwarfs as young and rapidly star forming as observed. An outflow model following scalings expected for momentum-driven winds broadly matches the observed galaxy evolution around M★ from z= 0 to 3, which is a significant success since these galaxies dominate cosmic star formation, but the failures at higher and lower masses highlight the challenges still faced by this class of models. We argue that central star-forming galaxies are well described as living in a slowly evolving equilibrium between inflows from gravity and recycled winds, star formation, and strong and ubiquitous outflows that regulate how much inflow forms into stars. Star-forming galaxy evolution is thus primarily governed by the continual cycling of baryons between galaxies and intergalactic gas.},

	abstract = {Cosmic rays ({CRs}) are transported out of the galaxy by diffusion and advection due to streaming along magnetic field lines and resonant scattering off self-excited Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic ({MHD}) waves. Thus momentum is transferred to the plasma via the frozen-in waves as a mediator assisting the thermal pressure in driving a galactic wind. Galactic {CRs} ({GCRs}) are accelerated by shock waves generated in supernova remnants ({SNRs}), and they propagate from the disc into the halo. Therefore {CR} acceleration in the halo strongly depends on the inner disc boundary conditions. We performed hydrodynamical simulations of galactic winds in flux tube geometry appropriate for disc galaxies, describing the {CR} diffusive-advective transport in a hydrodynamical fashion (by taking appropriate moments of the Fokker-Planck equation) along with the energy exchange with self-generated {MHD} waves. Our time-dependent {CR} hydrodynamic simulations confirm that the evolution of galactic winds with feedback depends on the structure of the galactic halo. In case of a wind-structured halo, the wind breaks down after the last super nova ({SN}) has exploded. The mechanism described here offers a natural and elegant solution to explain the power-law distribution of {CRs} between the `knee' and the `ankle'. The transition will be naturally smooth, because the Galactic {CRs} accelerated at {SN} shocks will be `post-accelerated' by shocks generated at the inner boundary and travelling through the halo.},

	abstract = {We present a new theoretical framework for using entropy to understand how outflows driven by supernovae are launched from disc galaxies: via continuous, buoyant acceleration through the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}). When young star clusters detonate supernovae in the interstellar medium ({ISM}) of a galaxy, they generate hot, diffuse bubbles that push on the surrounding {ISM} and evaporate that {ISM} into their interiors. As these bubbles reach the scale height of the {ISM}, they break out of the disc, rising into the {CGM}. Once these bubbles break out, if they have sufficiently high entropy, they will feel an upward acceleration, owing to a local buoyant force. This upward force will accelerate these bubbles, driving them to high galactocentric radii, keeping them in the {CGM} for {\textgreater} Gyr, even if their initial velocity is much lower than the local escape velocity. We derive an equation of motion for these entropy-driven winds that connects the {ISM} properties, halo mass, and {CGM} profile of galaxies to the ultimate evolution of feedback-driven winds. We explore the parameter space of these equations, and show how this novel mechanism can explain both self-consistent simulations of star formation and galactic outflows as well as the new wealth of observations of {CGM} kinematics. We show that these entropy-driven winds can produce long wind recycling times, while still carrying a significant amount of mass. Comparisons to simulations and observations show entropy-driven winds convincingly explain the kinematics of galactic outflows.},

	abstract = {We examine the connection between the properties of the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) and the quenching and morphological evolution of central galaxies in the {EAGLE} and {IllustrisTNG} simulations. The simulations yield very different median {CGM} mass fractions, \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CGM}\}\$, as a function of halo mass, \$M\_\{200\}\$, with low-mass haloes being significantly more gas-rich in {IllustrisTNG} than in {EAGLE}. Nonetheless, in both cases scatter in \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CGM}\}\$ at fixed \$M\_\{200\}\$ is strongly correlated with the specific star formation rate and the kinematic morphology of central galaxies. The correlations are strongest for \${\textbackslash}sim L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}star\$ galaxies, corresponding to the mass scale at which expulsive {AGN} feedback becomes efficient. This feedback elevates the {CGM} cooling time, preventing gas from accreting onto the galaxy to fuel star formation, and thus establishing a preference for quenched, spheroidal galaxies to be hosted by haloes with low \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CGM}\}\$ for their mass. In both simulations, \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CGM}\}\$ correlates negatively with the host halo's intrinsic concentration, and hence with its binding energy and formation redshift, primarily because early halo formation fosters the rapid early growth of the central black hole ({BH}). This leads to a lower \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CGM}\}\$ at fixed \$M\_\{200\}\$ in {EAGLE} because the {BH} reaches high accretion rates sooner, whilst in {IllustrisTNG} it occurs because the central {BH} reaches the mass threshold at which {AGN} feedback is assumed to switch from thermal to kinetic injection earlier. Despite these differences, there is consensus from these state-of-the-art simulations that the expulsion of efficiently-cooling gas from the {CGM} is a crucial step in the quenching and morphological evolution of central galaxies.},

	abstract = {Heating of virialized gas by streaming cosmic rays ({CRs}) may be energetically important in galaxy halos, groups and clusters. We present a linear thermal stability analysis of plasmas heated by streaming {CRs}. We separately treat equilibria with and without background gradients, and with and without gravity. We include both {CR} streaming and diffusion along the magnetic-field direction. Thermal stability depends strongly on the ratio of {CR} pressure to gas pressure, which determines whether modes are isobaric or isochoric. Modes with \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{k {\textbackslash}cdot B \}{\textbackslash}neq 0\$ are strongly affected by {CR} diffusion. When the streaming time is shorter than the {CR} diffusion time, thermally unstable modes (with \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{k {\textbackslash}cdot B \}{\textbackslash}neq 0\$) are waves propagating at a speed \${\textbackslash}propto\$ the Alfv{\textbackslash}'en speed. Halo gas in photoionization equilibrium is thermally stable independent of {CR} pressure, while gas in collisional ionization equilibrium is unstable for physically realistic parameters. In gravitationally stratified plasmas, the oscillation frequency of thermally overstable modes can be higher in the presence of {CR} streaming than the buoyancy/free-fall frequency. This may modify the critical \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ at which multiphase gas is present. The criterion for convective instability of a stratified, {CR}-heated medium can be written in the familiar Schwarzschild form \$d s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} / d z {\textless} 0\$, where \$s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ is an effective entropy involving the gas and {CR} pressures.

We construct two-dimensional axisymmetric models of the local starburst and super-wind galaxy M82 using the {CR} propagation code {GALPROP}. Using prescribed gas density and magnetic field distributions, wind profiles, {CR} injection rates, and stellar radiation fields, we simultaneously fit both the integrated gamma-ray emission and the spatially-resolved multi-frequency radio emission extended along M82's minor axis. We explore the resulting constraints on the gas density, magnetic field strength, {CR} energy density, and the assumed {CR} advection profile. In accord with earlier one-zone studies, we generically find low central {CR} pressures, strong secondary electron/positron production, and an important role for relativistic bremsstrahlung losses in shaping the synchrotron spectrum. We find that the relatively low central {CR} density produces {CR} pressure gradients that are weak compared to gravity, strongly limiting the role of {CRs} in driving M82's fast and mass-loaded galactic outflow. Our models require strong magnetic fields and advection speeds of order {\textasciitilde}1000 km/s on kpc scales along the minor axis in order to reproduce the extended radio emission. Degeneracies between the controlling physical parameters of the model and caveats to these findings are discussed.},

For each, we describe the measured clustering signal with a power-law correlation function xi(r) = (r/r\_0){\textasciicircum}(-gamma) and find that (r\_0,gamma) = (5.48 +/- 0.07 h\_100{\textasciicircum}-1 Mpc, 1.33 +/- 0.04) for the auto-correlation and (6.00 +/- 1 h{\textasciicircum}-1 Mpc, 1.25 +/- 0.18) for galaxy-{OVI} cross-correlation. We further estimate a bias factor of b\_gg = 1.3 +/- 0.1 from the galaxy-galaxy auto-correlation indicating the galaxies are hosted by halos with mass M\_halo {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}(12.1 +/- 0.05) Msun. Finally, we estimate an {OVI}-galaxy bias factor b\_OVI = 1.0 +/- 0.1 from the cross-correlation which is consistent with {OVI} absorbers being hosted by dark matter halos with typical mass M\_halo {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}(11) Msun. Future works with upcoming datasets (e.g., {CGM}{\textasciicircum}2) will improve upon these results and will assess whether any of the detected {OVI} arises in the intergalactic medium.},

	abstract = {Galaxies represent the main form of organization of matter in our universe. Therefore, they are of obvious interest for the new multidisciplinary field of astrobiology. In particular, to study habitability of galaxies represents one of the main emerging challenges of theoretical and numerical astrobiology. Its theoretical underpinnings are, however, often confused and vague. Here we present a systematic attempt to list and categorize major causal factors playing a role in emergent habitability of galaxies. Furthermore, we argue that the methodology of cosmological merger trees is particularly useful in delineating what are systematic and lawful astrobiological properties of galaxies at present epoch vs. those which are product of historical contingency and, in particular, interaction with wider extragalactic environment. Employing merger trees extracted from cosmological N-body simulations as a new and promising research method for astrobiology has been pioneered by Stanway et al. (2018). We analyse the general issue of applicability of merger trees and present preliminary results on a set of trees extracted from the Illustris Project. In a sense, this approach is directly complementary to using large-scale cosmological simulations to study habitable zones of individual galaxies with high mass/spatial resolution; taken together, they usher a new era of synergy and synthesis between cosmology and astrobiology.},

	abstract = {Integral Field Spectroscopy ({IFS}) is well known for providing detailed insight of extended sources thanks to the possibility of handling space resolved spectroscopic information. Simple and straightforward analysis such as single line fitting yield interesting results, although it might miss a more complete picture in many cases. Violent star forming regions, such as starburst galaxies, display very complex emission line profiles due to multiple kinematic components superposed in the line of sight. We perform a spatially resolved kinematical study of a single Green Pea ({GP}) galaxy, {SDSSJ}083843.63+385350.5, using a new method for analyzing Integral Field Unit ({IFU}) observations of emission line spectra. The method considers the presence of multiple components in the emission-line profiles and makes use of a statistical indicator to determine the meaningful number of components to fit the observed profiles. We are able to identify three distinct kinematic features throughout the field and discuss their link with a rotating component, a strong outflow and a turbulent mixing layer. We also derive an updated star formation rate for {\textbackslash}ourobj and discuss the link between the observed signatures of a large scale outflow and of the Lyman continuum ({LyC}) leakage detected in {GP} galaxies.},

We use a sample of \${\textbackslash}sim40\$ spectroscopically confirmed {PSBs}, recently identified in the {UDS} field, and perform a stacking analysis in order to analyse the structure of strong interstellar absorption features such as Mg ii (\${\textbackslash}lambda2800\$ Ang.). We find that for massive (\$M\_* {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) {PSBs} at \$z {\textgreater} 1\$, there is clear evidence for a strong blue-shifted component to the Mg ii absorption feature, indicative of high-velocity outflows (\$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm out\}{\textbackslash}sim1150{\textbackslash}pm160{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},km{\textbackslash},s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) in the interstellar medium. We conclude that such outflows are typical in massive {PSBs} at this epoch, and potentially represent the residual signature of a feedback process that quenched these galaxies. Using full spectral fitting, we also obtain a typical stellar velocity dispersion \${\textbackslash}sigma\_*\$ for these {PSBs} of \${\textbackslash}sim200{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},km{\textbackslash},s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, which confirms they are intrinsically massive in nature (dynamical mass \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm d\}{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$). Given that these high-\$z\$ {PSBs} are also exceptionally compact (\$r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}{\textbackslash}sim1\$--\$2{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},kpc\$) and spheroidal (Sersic index \$n{\textbackslash}sim3\$), we propose that the outflowing winds may have been launched during a recent compaction event (e.g. major merger or disc collapse) that triggered either a centralised starburst or active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) activity. Finally, we find no evidence for {AGN} signatures in the optical spectra of these {PSBs}, suggesting they were either quenched by stellar feedback from the starburst itself, or that if {AGN} feedback is responsible, the {AGN} episode that triggered quenching does not linger into the post-starburst phase.},

The observations reveal a compact, high-ionization outflow region (r\_max{\textasciitilde}0.9 kpc) set in a more extensive (r\_max{\textasciitilde}1.4 kpc) halo that is kinematically quiescent and has a lower ionization state. A large line width (600 {\textless} {FWHM} {\textless} 1500 km/s) is measured throughout the outflow region, and the outflowing gas shows a steep velocity gradient with radius, with the magnitude of the blueshifted velocities increasing from {\textasciitilde}500 to 1800 km/s from the inner to the outer part of the outflow. We interpret the observations in terms of the local acceleration, and hydrodynamic destruction, of dense clouds as they are swept up in a hot, low density wind driven by the {AGN}.

In this context, the community carries an effort to model the aspects of star cluster formation and evolution in galactic and even cosmological context. However, it is not always easy to understand the caveats and the shortcuts taken in theories and simulations, and their implications on the conclusions drawn.

All considered galaxies have star formation driven bi-conical central outflows ({SFB}), with no signs of {AGN}. We find that the {SFB} outflows require high central concentration of the star formation rate. This increases the gas velocity dispersion over the equilibrium limit and helps maintain the gas outflows. The central starbursts increase the metallicity, extinction, and the alpha/Fe ratio in the gas. Significant amount of young stellar population at the centers suggests that the {SFBs} are associated with the formation of young bulges in galaxies. More than 70\% of {SFB} galaxies are group members or have companions with no prominent interaction, or show asymmetry of external isophotes. In 15\% {SFB} cases stars and gas rotate in the opposite directions, which points at the gas infall from satellites as the primary reason for triggering the {SFB} phenomena.},

We use spherically-symmetric, idealized, high-resolution simulations of the {CGM} in \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ dark matter halos to characterize the gas pressure, turbulent and radial velocities, and degree of thermal and effective dynamic pressure support in the overall {CGM} as well as in its high- and low-temperature phases. We find that the \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ halo contains a {CGM} mostly formed of a hot gas halo in hydrostatic equilibrium out of which cold gas condenses and falls onto the central galaxy, while the \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ halo's {CGM} is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, has a wider spread of properties at a given galactocentric radius, does not have a clear separation of hot and cold phases, and is dominated by bulk motions. We also find that the degree of pressure support in the \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ halo is strongly dependent on the parameters of the galactic winds of the central galaxy. These results promote the idea that there is no "average" {CGM} and care must be taken when setting the initial conditions for a small-box simulation of a patch of the {CGM}.},

	abstract = {Stellar feedback plays a significant role in modulating star formation, redistributing metals, and shaping the baryonic and dark structure of galaxies -- however, the efficiency of its energy deposition to the interstellar medium is challenging to constrain observationally.

We use {\textbackslash}texttt\{{STARBURST}99\} models and prescriptions for feedback from simulations to demonstrate that the observed star formation energetics can reproduce the ionised and molecular gas dynamics -- provided a dominant component of the momentum injection comes from direct photon pressure from young stars, on top of supernovae, photoionisation heating and stellar winds. The mechanical energy budget from these sources is comparable to low luminosity {AGN}, suggesting that stellar feedback can be a relevant driver of bulk gas motions in galaxy centres - although here \${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ of the ionized gas mass is escaping the galaxy. We test several scenarios for the survival/formation of the cold gas in the outflow, including in-situ condensation and cooling. Interestingly, the geometry of the molecular gas shell, observed magnetic field strengths and emission line diagnostics are consistent with a scenario where magnetic field lines aided survival of the dusty {ISM} as it was initially launched (with mass loading factor \${\textbackslash}lesssim 1\$) from the ring by stellar feedback. This system's unique feedback driven morphology can hopefully serve as a useful litmus test for feedback prescriptions in magnetohydrodynamical galaxy simulations.},

	abstract = {We present direct \$N\$-body simulations of tidally filling 30,000 \$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ star clusters orbiting between 10 kpc and 100 kpc in galaxies with a range of dark matter substructure properties. The time-dependent tidal force is determined based on the combined tidal tensor of the galaxy's smooth and clumpy dark matter components, the latter of which causes fluctuations in the tidal field that can heat clusters. The strength and duration of these fluctuations are sensitive to the local dark matter density, substructure fraction, sub-halo mass function, and the sub-halo mass-size relation. Based on the cold dark matter framework, we initially assume sub-halos are Hernquist spheres following a power-law mass function between \$10{\textasciicircum}5\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and find that tidal fluctuations are too weak and too short to affect star cluster evolution. Treating sub-halos as point masses, to explore how denser sub-halos affect clusters, we find that only sub-halos with masses greater than \$10{\textasciicircum}\{6\} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ will cause cluster dissolution times to decrease. These interactions can also decrease the size of a cluster while increasing the velocity dispersion and tangential anisotropy in the outer regions via tidal heating. Hence increased fluctuations in the tidal tensor, especially fluctuations that are due to low-mass halos, do not necessarily translate into mass loss. We further conclude that the tidal approximation can be used to model cluster evolution in the tidal fields of cosmological simulations with a minimum cold dark matter sub-halo mass of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{6\} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, as the effect of lower-mass sub-halos on star clusters is negligible.},

Exploiting constraints derived from Hubble Space Telescope images and Keck longslit spectroscopy, our finding of apparent debris trails and dramatically enhanced star formation rates in an additional seven {RPS} candidates support the hypothesis that {RPS}, and hence rapid galaxy evolution in high-density environments, is intricately linked to cluster collisions. Unexpectedly, we find the vast majority of {RPS} candidates in A1758N to be moving toward us, and in a shared direction as projected on the plane of the sky. We hypothesize that this directional bias is the result of two successive events: (1) the quenching, during and after the first core passage, of star formation in galaxies with an approximately isotropic velocity distribution within the central region of the merger, and (2) {RPS} events triggered in late-type galaxies falling into the merging system along a filament, possibly enhanced by a shock front expanding into the outskirts of the south-eastern subcluster. Since this explanation implies that the merger axis of A1758N must be significantly inclined with respect to the plane of the sky, our findings open the possibility of {RPS} events becoming important diagnostic tools to constrain the geometry of cluster collisions that, due to the orientation of the merger axis, lack the classic observational signatures of face-on mergers.},

At low masses, the increase in {SFR} in mergers is mostly attributed to an increase in the \$H\_2\$ content, but for \$M\_*{\textbackslash}geq 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ mergers also show an elevated star formation efficiency suggesting denser gas within merging galaxies. The merger rate for star-forming galaxies shows a rapid increase with redshift \${\textbackslash}propto (1+z){\textasciicircum}\{3.5\}\$, but the quenching rate evolves much more slowly, \${\textbackslash}propto (1+z){\textasciicircum}\{0.9\}\$; there are insufficient mergers to explain the quenching rate at \$z{\textbackslash}leq 1.5\$. Simba first quenches galaxies at \$z{\textbackslash}geq 3\$, with a number density in good agreement with observations. The quenching timescales \${\textbackslash}tau\_q\$ are strongly bimodal, with `slow' quenchings (\${\textbackslash}tau\_q {\textbackslash}sim 0.1t\_\{H\}\$) dominating overall, but `fast' quenchings (\${\textbackslash}tau\_q{\textbackslash}sim 0.01 t\_H\$) dominating in \$M\_*{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ galaxies, likely induced by Simba's jet-mode black hole feedback. The delay time distribution between mergers and quenching events suggests no physical connection to either fast or slow quenching. Hence, Simba predicts that major mergers induce starbursts, but are unrelated to quenching in either fast or slow mode.},

	abstract = {We investigate the build-up of the galactic dynamo and subsequently the origin of a magnetic driven outflow. We use a setup of an isolated disc galaxy with a realistic circum-galactic medium ({CGM}). We find good agreement of the galactic dynamo with theoretical and observational predictions from the radial and toroidal components of the magnetic field as function of radius and disc scale height. We find several field reversals indicating dipole structure at early times and quadrupole structure at late times. Together with the magnetic pitch angle and the dynamo control parameters \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$, \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}omega\}\$ and \$D\$ we present strong evidence for an \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textasciicircum}2\$-\${\textbackslash}Omega\$ dynamo. The formation of a bar in the centre leads to further amplification of the magnetic field via adiabatic compression which subsequently drives an outflow. Due to the Parker-Instability the magnetic field lines rise to the edge of the disc, break out and expand freely in the {CGM} driven by the magnetic pressure. Finally, we investigate the correlation between magnetic field and star formation rate. Globally, we find that the magnetic field is increasing as function of the star formation rate surface density with a slope between \$0.3\$ and \$0.45\$ in good agreement with predictions from theory and observations. Locally, we find that the magnetic field can decrease while star formation increases. We find that this effect is correlated with the diffusion of magnetic field from the spiral arms to the inter-arm regions which we explicitly include by solving the induction equation and accounting for non-linear terms.},

	title = {Global Simulations of Galactic Discs: Violent Feedback from Clustered Supernovae during Bursts of Star Formation},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10623},
	abstract = {A suite of idealised, global, gravitationally unstable, star-forming galactic disc simulations with 2 pc spatial resolution, performed with the adaptive mesh refinement code {RAMSES} is used in this paper to predict the emergent effects of supernova feedback. The simulations include a simplified prescriptions for formation of single stellar populations of mass \${\textbackslash}sim 100 {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, radiative cooling, photoelectric heating, an external gravitational potential for a dark matter halo and an old stellar disc, self-gravity, and a novel implementation of supernova feedback. The results of these simulations show that gravitationally unstable discs can generate violent supersonic winds with mass loading factors \${\textbackslash}eta {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10\$, followed by a galactic fountain phase. These violent winds are generated by highly clustered supernovae exploding in dense environments created by gravitational instability, and they are not produced in simulation without self-gravity. The violent winds significantly perturb the vertical structure of the disc, which is later re-established during the galactic fountain phase. Gas resettles into a quasi-steady, highly turbulent disc with volume-weighted velocity dispersion \${\textbackslash}sigma {\textgreater} 50 {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm km/s\}\$. The new configuration drives weaker galactic winds with mass loading factor \${\textbackslash}eta {\textbackslash}leq 0.1\$. The whole cycle takes place in \${\textbackslash}leq 10\$ dynamical times. Such high time variability needs to be taken into account when interpreting observations of galactic winds from starburst and post-starburst galaxies.},

Discovered in a recent set of targeted far-{UV} \${HST}\$/{COS} spectroscopic observations, these absorbers have the highest H I column densities ever observed in the outskirts of galaxy clusters, and are also rich in metal absorption lines. Photoionization models yield single phase solutions for the three absorbers with gas densities of \$n\_\{H\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} - 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ and metallicities of [X/H] \${\textgreater}\$ -1.0 (from one-tenth solar to near-solar). The widths of detected absorption lines suggest gas temperatures of \$T {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ K. The inferred densities (temperatures) are significantly higher (lower) compared to the X-ray emitting intracluster medium in cluster cores. The absorbers are tracing a cool phase of the intracluster gas in the cluster outskirts, either associated with gas stripped from cluster galaxies via outflows, tidal streams or ram-pressure forces, or denser regions within the intracluster medium that were uniformly chemically enriched from an earlier epoch of enhanced supernova and {AGN} feedback.},

The detection rate of outflows increases from the protostellar stage to the H {II} stage, but decreases again at the photodissociation ({PDR}) stage suggesting that outflows are being switched off during the {PDR} stage. An intimate relationship is found between outflow action and the presence of masers, and water masers appear together with 6.7 {GHz} methanol masers. Comparing the infall detection rate of clumps with and without outflows, we find that outflow candidates have a lower infall detection rate. Finally, we find that outflow action has some influence on the local environment and the clump itself, and this influence decreases with increasing evolutionary time as the outflow action ceases.},

	abstract = {We present results from our on-going {MusE} {GAs} {FLOw} and Wind ({MEGAFLOW}) survey, which consists of 22 quasar lines-of-sight, each observed with the integral field unit ({IFU}) {MUSE} and the {UVES} spectrograph at the {ESO} Very Large Telescopes ({VLT}). The goals of this survey are to study the properties of the circum-galactic medium around \$z{\textbackslash}sim1\$ star-forming galaxies. The absorption-line selected survey consists of 79 strong {\textbackslash}{MgII}{\textbackslash} absorbers (with rest-frame equivalent width ({REW})\${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$0.5{\textbackslash}{AA}) and, currently, 86 associated galaxies within 100 projected{\textasciitilde}kpc of the quasar with stellar masses (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$) from \$10{\textasciicircum}9\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ {\textbackslash}msun. We find that the cool halo gas traced by {\textbackslash}{MgII}{\textbackslash} is not isotropically distributed around these galaxies, as we show the strong bi-modal distribution in the azimuthal angle of the apparent location of the quasar with respect to the galaxy major-axis. This supports a scenario in which outflows are bi-conical in nature and co-exist with a coplanar gaseous structure extending at least up to 60 to 80 kpc. Assuming that absorbers near the minor axis probe outflows, the current {MEGAFLOW} sample allowed us to select 26 galaxy-quasar pairs suitable for studying winds. From this sample, we find that the outflow velocity only exceeds the escape velocity when \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}{\textbackslash}lesssim 4{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}9\${\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}msun, implying the cool material is likely to fall back except in the smallest halos. Finally, using a simple geometrical model, we find that the mass loading factor \${\textbackslash}eta\$, the ratio between the ejected mass rate and the star formation rate ({SFR}), appears to be roughly constant with respect to the galaxy mass.},

	abstract = {We present a novel absorption line survey using 54 blue horizontal branch stars ({BHBs}) in the Milky Way halo as background sources for detecting gas flows at the disk-halo interface. Distance measurements to high-latitude (\$b\$ {\textgreater} 60\{{\textbackslash}deg\}) background stars at 3.1-13.4 kpc, combined with unprecedented spatial sampling and spectral resolution, allow us to examine the 3-dimensional spatial distribution and kinematics of gas flows near the disk. We detect absorption signatures of extraplanar {CaII} and {NaI} in Keck {HIRES} spectra and find that their column densities exhibit no trend with distance to the background sources, indicating that these clouds lie within 3.1 kpc of the disk. We calculate covering fractions of \$f\_\{{CaII}\}\$ = 63\%, \$f\_\{{NaI}\}\$ = 26\%, and \$f\_\{{HI}\}\$ = 52\%, consistent with a picture of the {CGM} that includes multi-phase clouds containing small clumps of cool gas within hotter, more diffuse gas. Our measurements constrain the scale of any substructure within these cool clouds to {\textless}0.5 kpc. {CaII} and {NaI} absorption features exhibit an intermediate-velocity ({IV}) component inflowing at velocities of -75 km/s {\textless} v {\textless} -25 km/s relative to the local standard of rest, consistent with previously-studied {HI} structures in this region. We report the new detection of an inflow velocity gradient \$\{{\textbackslash}Delta\}v\_z\$ {\textasciitilde} 6-9 km/s/kpc across the Galactic plane. These findings place constraints on the physical and kinematic properties of {CGM} gas flows through the disk-halo interface, and support a galactic fountain model in which cold gas rains back onto the disk.},

	doi = {10.1086/427277},
	abstract = {Measurements of interstellar absorption lines in 18 ultraluminous infrared galaxies ({ULIGs}) have been combined with published data, in order to reassess the dependence of galactic outflow speeds on starburst luminosity and galactic mass. The Doppler shifts reveal outflows of relatively cool gas at \$330 {\textbackslash}pm 100\$km/s. The outflow speeds increase with the star formation rate ({SFR}) as roughly \$v {\textbackslash}propto {SFR}{\textasciicircum}\{0.35\}\$. This result is surprising since, in the traditional model for starburst-driven winds, these relatively cool gas clouds are accelerated by the ram pressure of a hot, supernova-heated wind that exhibits weak (if any) {\textbackslash}x temperature variation with increasing galactic mass. The lack of evidence for much hotter winds is partly a sensitivity issue; but the outflow velocities in ultraluminous starbursts actually are consistent with acceleration by the tepid wind, indicating a hotter component is unlikely to dominate the momentum flux. The {\textbackslash}nad velocities in the dwarf starburst winds do not reach the terminal velocity of a hot wind at the measured temperature of {kT} {\textasciitilde}0.73 {keV}. A dynamically-motivated explanation is that the dwarf starburst winds simply lack enough momentum to accelerate the clouds to the velocity of the hot wind. Among the subsample of starbursts with well- constrained dynamical masses, the terminal outflow velocities approach the galactic escape velocity. If this relation, which is similar to that observed for stellar winds, arises from radiation pressure on dust and gas limiting the maximum luminosity of a starburst, then feedback will be stronger in massive galaxies than previously thought helping shape the high-mass end of the galaxy luminosity function.},

	abstract = {We present {MeerKAT} observations of neutral hydrogen gas ({HI}) in the nearby merger remnant {NGC} 1316 (Fornax A), the brightest member of a galaxy group which is falling into the Fornax cluster. We find {HI} on a variety of scales, from the galaxy centre to its large-scale environment. For the first time we detect {HI} at large radii (70 - 150 kpc in projection), mostly distributed on two long tails associated with the galaxy. Gas in the tails dominates the {HI} mass of {NGC} 1316: 7e+8 Msun -- 14 times more than in previous observations. The total {HI} mass is comparable to the amount of neutral gas found inside the stellar body, mostly in molecular form. The {HI} tails are associated with faint optical tidal features thought to be the remnant of a galaxy merger occurred a few billion years ago. They demonstrate that the merger was gas-rich. During the merger, tidal forces pulled some gas and stars out to large radii, where we now detect them in the form of optical tails and, thanks to our new data, {HI} tails; while torques caused the remaining gas to flow towards the centre of the remnant, where it was converted into molecular gas and fuelled the starburst revealed by the galaxy's stellar populations. Several of the observed properties of {NGC} 1316 can be reproduced by a {\textasciitilde} 10:1 merger between a dominant, gas-poor early-type galaxy and a smaller, gas-rich spiral occurred 1 - 3 Gyr ago, likely followed by subsequent accretion of satellite galaxies.},

The sky covering fraction, defined as the ratio between the number of detections and the sample size, increases from at about 40\% for all targets to 100\% for the brightest targets, suggesting a uniform distribution of the O {VII} absorbers. We correlate the line equivalent width with the Galactic coordinates and do not find any strong correlations between these quantities. Some {AGNs} have warm absorbers that may complicate the analysis of the local X-ray absorber since the recession velocity can be compensated by the outflow velocity, especially for the nearby targets. We discuss the potential impact of the warm absorbers on our analysis. A comprehensive theoretical modelling of the X-ray absorbers will be presented in a later paper.},

The measurement is based on cross-correlating the positions of about one million red galaxies at z ˜ 0.5 and the flux decrements induced in the spectra of about 105 background quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that: (i) this galaxy-gas correlation reveals a change of slope on scales of about 1 Mpc, consistent with the expected transition from a dark matter halo dominated environment to a regime where clustering is dominated by halo-halo correlations. Assuming that, on average, the distribution of Mg {II} gas follows that of dark matter up to a gas-to-mass ratio, we find the standard halo model to provide an accurate description of the gas distribution over three orders of magnitude in scale. Within this framework, we estimate the average host halo mass of {LRGs} to be about 1013.5 M⊙, in agreement with other methods. We also find the Mg {II} gas-to-mass ratio around {LRGs} to be consistent with the cosmic mean value estimated on Mpc scales. Combining our galaxy-gas correlation and the galaxy-mass correlation function from galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses, we can directly measure the Mg {II} gas-to-mass ratio as a function of scale and reach the same conclusion. (ii) From linewidth estimates, we show that the velocity dispersion of the gas clouds also shows the expected one- and two-halo behaviours. On large scales the gas distribution follows the Hubble flow, whereas on small scales we observe the velocity dispersion of the Mg {II} gas clouds to be lower than that of collisionless dark matter particles within their host halo.},

These observations were chosen from a much larger set of observations as they are expected to be the least contaminated by solar wind charge exchange emission. We characterize the halo emission in the {XMM}-Newton band with a single-temperature plasma model. We find that the observed halo temperature is fairly constant across the sky ({\textasciitilde}(1.8-2.4) × 106 K), whereas the halo emission measure varies by an order of magnitude ({\textasciitilde}0.0005-0.006 cm-6 pc). When we compare our observations with the model predictions, we find that most of the hot gas observed with {XMM}-Newton does not reside in isolated extraplanar supernova ({SN}) remnants—this model predicts emission an order of magnitude too faint. A model of an {SN}-driven interstellar medium, including the flow of hot gas from the disk into the halo in a galactic fountain, gives good agreement with the observed 0.4-2.0 {keV} surface brightness. This model overpredicts the halo X-ray temperature by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2, but there are a several possible explanations for this discrepancy. We therefore conclude that a major (possibly dominant) contributor to the halo X-ray emission observed with {XMM}-Newton is a fountain of hot gas driven into the halo by disk {SNe}. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the extended hot halo of accreted material predicted by disk galaxy formation models also contributes to the emission.},

In an attempt to minimize contamination from near-Earth solar wind charge exchange ({SWCX}) emission, we remove times of high solar wind proton flux from the data. Without this filtering we are able to extract measurements from 586 {XMM}-Newton observations. With this filtering, {\textasciitilde}1/2 of the observations are rendered unusable, and we are able to extract measurements from 303 observations. The oxygen intensities are typically {\textasciitilde}0.5-10 photons cm-2 s-1 sr-1 (line units, L.U.) for O {VII} and {\textasciitilde}0-5 L.U. for O {VIII}. The proton flux filtering does not systematically reduce the oxygen intensities measured from a given observation. However, the filtering does preferentially remove the observations with higher oxygen intensities. Our data set includes 69 directions with multiple observations, whose oxygen intensity variations can be used to constrain {SWCX} models. One observation exhibits an O {VII} enhancement of {\textasciitilde}25 L.U. over two other observations of the same direction, although most {SWCX} enhancements are lsim4 L.U. for O {VII} and lsim2 L.U. for O {VIII}. We find no clear tendency for the O {VII} centroid to shift toward the forbidden line energy in observations with bright {SWCX} enhancements. There is also no universal association between enhanced {SWCX} emission and increased solar wind flux or the closeness of the sightline to the sub-solar region of the magnetosheath. After removing observations likely to be contaminated by heliospheric {SWCX} emission, we use our results to examine the Galactic halo. There is some scatter in the halo intensity about the predictions of a simple plane-parallel model, indicating a patchiness to the halo emission. The O {VII}/O {VIII} intensity ratio implies a halo temperature of {\textasciitilde}2.0-2.5 × 106 K, in good agreement with previous studies.},

	abstract = {We present the equivalent width and column density measurements for low and intermediate ionization states of the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) surrounding 44 low-z, L {\textasciitilde} L* galaxies drawn from the {COS}-Halos survey. These measurements are derived from far-{UV} transitions observed in {HST}/{COS} and Keck/{HIRES} spectra of background quasars within an impact parameter R {\textless} 160 kpc to the targeted galaxies. The data show significant metal-line absorption for 33 of the 44 galaxies, including quiescent systems, revealing the common occurance of a cool (T {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}\{4 - 5\} K), metal-enriched {CGM}. The detection rates and column densities derived for these metal lines decrease with increasing impact parameter, a trend we interpret as a declining metal surface density profile for the {CGM}. A comparison of the relative column densities of adjacent ionization states indicates the gas is predominantly ionized. The large surface density in metals demands a large reservoir of metals and gas in the cool {CGM} (very conservatively, M\_ {CGMcool} {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}9 {MSun}), which likely traces a distinct density and/or temperature regime from the highly-ionized {CGM} traced by {OVI} absorption. The large dispersion in absorption strengths (including non-detections) suggests the cool {CGM} traces a wide range of densities or a mix of local ionizing conditions. Lastly, the kinematics inferred from the metal-line profiles are consistent with the cool {CGM} being bound to the dark matters halos hosting the galaxies; this gas may serve as fuel for future star-formation. Future work will leverage this dataset to provide estimates on the mass, metallicity, dynamics, and origin of the cool {CGM} in low-z, L* galaxies.},

	abstract = {Observations reveal massive amounts of {OVI} around star-forming \$L\_*\$ galaxies, with covering fractions of near unity extending to the host halo's virial radius. This {OVI} absorption is typically kinematically centered upon photoionized gas, with line widths that are suprathermal and kinematically offset from the galaxy. We discuss various scenarios and whether they could result in the observed phenomenology (cooling gas flows, boundary layers, shocks, virialized gas, photoionized clouds in thermal equilibrium). If predominantly collisionally ionized, as we argue is most probable, the {OVI} observations require that the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) of \$L\_*\$ galaxies holds nearly all the associated baryons within a virial radius (\${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) and hosts massive flows of cooling gas with \${\textbackslash}approx30[{nT}/30\{{\textbackslash}rm{\textasciitilde}cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}K\}]{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textasciitilde}\$yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, which must be largely prevented from accreting onto the host galaxy. Cooling and feedback energetics considerations require \$10 {\textless}{\textbackslash}langle {nT}{\textbackslash}rangle{\textless}100\{{\textbackslash}rm{\textasciitilde}cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}K\}\$ for the warm and hot halo gases. We argue that virialized gas, boundary layers, hot winds, and shocks are unlikely to directly account for the bulk of the {OVI}. Furthermore, we show that there is a robust constraint on the number density of many of the photoionized \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}4\$K absorption systems that yields upper bounds in the range \$n{\textless}(0.1-3){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}(Z/0.3)\$cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, where \$Z\$ is the metallicity, suggestive that the dominant pressure in some photoionized clouds is nonthermal. This constraint, which requires minimal ionization modeling, is in accord with the low densities inferred from more complex photoionization modeling. The large amount of cooling gas that is inferred could re-form these clouds in a fraction of the halo dynamical time, as some arguments require, and it requires much of the feedback energy available from supernovae and stellar winds to be dissipated in the {CGM}.},

	abstract = {Metallicity and gas content are intimately related in the baryonic exchange cycle of galaxies, and galaxy evolution scenarios can be constrained by quantifying this relation. To this end, we have compiled a sample of {\textasciitilde}450 galaxies in the Local Universe, dubbed "{MAGMA}" (Metallicity And Gas for Mass Assembly), which covers an unprecedented range in parameter space, spanning more than 5 orders of magnitude in stellar mass (Mstar), star-formation rate ({SFR}), and gas mass (Mgas), and a factor of {\textasciitilde}60 in metallicity [Z, 12+log(O/H)]. We have applied 4-dimensional and 3-dimensional (3D) principal component analyses ({PCAs}) to our sample, to assess the true dimensionality of the data. In confirmation of previous work, we find that even with the vast parameter space covered by {MAGMA}, the relations between Mstar, {SFR}, Z and Mgas ({MHI}+{MH}2) require only two dimensions to describe the hypersurface. Nevertheless, to accommodate the curvature in the Mstar-Z relation, we have applied a piecewise 3D {PCA} that successfully predicts observed 12+log(O/H) to an accuracy of {\textasciitilde}0.07 dex. We also present a new relation to express Mgas as a linear combination of Mstar and {SFR}, to an accuracy of {\textasciitilde}0.2 dex. Finally, for the first time on a statistically significant sample with all the necessary measurements, we quantify Mgas as a function of Mstar and evaluate the effect of gas on the mass-metallicity relation ({MZR}). By inferring the metallicity-loading and mass-loading factors for the outflows produced by the {MAGMA} galaxies, we find that the metal-retention efficiency is not constant with Mstar; metals are expelled more efficiently from low-mass galaxies than from massive ones. Agreement with earlier work is excellent, but is highly sensitive to the values adopted for the stellar nucleosynthetic yield y. Our analysis shows clearly that gas content and outflows driven by star formation shape the {MZR}.},

	abstract = {Cosmic rays play a pivotal role in launching galactic winds, particularly in quiescently star-forming galaxies where the hot gas alone is not sufficient to drive a wind. Except for the Milky Way, not much is known about the transport of cosmic rays in galaxies. In this Letter, we present low-frequency observations of the nearby edge-on spiral galaxy {NGC} 4565 using the {LOw}-Frequency {ARray} ({LOFAR}). With our deep 144-{MHz} observations, we obtain a clean estimate of the emission originating from old cosmic-ray electrons ({CRe}), which is almost free from contamination by thermal emission. We measured vertical profiles of the non-thermal radio continuum emission that we fitted with Gaussian and exponential functions. The different profile shapes correspond to 1D cosmic-ray transport models of pure diffusion and advection, respectively. We detect a warp in the radio continuum that is reminiscent of the previously known {HI} warp. Because the warp is not seen at {GHz}-frequencies in the radio continuum, its minimum age must be about 100 Myr. The warp also explains the slight flaring of the thick radio disc that can otherwise be well described by a Gaussian profile with an {FWHM} of 65 arcsec (3.7 kpc). The diffusive radio halo together with the extra-planar X-ray emission may be remnants of enhanced star-forming activity in the past where the galaxy had a galactic wind, as {GHz}-observations indicate only a weak outflow in the last 40 Myr. {NGC} 4565 could be in transition from an outflow- to an inflow-dominated phase.},

We compiled a sample of medium-resolution (\${\textbackslash}delta\$v \${\textless}\$ 50 km/s) and high signal-to-noise (typical {SNR} \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 10) spectra from 27 {GRB} afterglows covering z \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 2 - 6, with six of them at z \${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$ 4. We analyzed the high- and low-ionization absorption features within \${\textbackslash}pm\$400 km/s to extract the {CGM} and {ISM} kinematics. In the stacked spectra, high-ionization absorption profiles (e.g. C {IV}, Si {IV}) present significant absorption excess in their blue wings (v \${\textless}\$ -100 km/s) relative to the red wings (v \${\textgreater}\$ 100 km/s). The stronger blue wings in high-ionization species are indicative of the presence of ubiquitous warm outflows in the {GRB} hosts at high redshifts.

	abstract = {We investigate the geometric distribution of gas metallicities in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) around \$47\$, \$z{\textless}0.7\$ galaxies from the "Multiphase Galaxy Halos" Survey. Using a combination of quasar spectra from {HST}/{COS} and from Keck/{HIRES} or {VLT}/{UVES} we measure column densities of, or determine limits on, {CGM} absorption lines. We then use a Monte-Carlo Markov chain approach with Cloudy to estimate the metallicity of cool (T\${\textbackslash}sim\$\$10{\textasciicircum}4\$K) {CGM} gas. We also use {HST} images to determine host galaxy inclination and quasar--galaxy azimuthal angles.

We find (1) while the metallicity distribution appears bimodal, a Hartigan dip test cannot rule out a unimodal distribution (\$0.4{\textbackslash}sigma\$). (2) {CGM} metallicities are independent of halo mass, spanning three orders of magnitude at fixed halo mass. (3) The {CGM} metallicity does not depend on the galaxy azimuthal and inclination angles regardless of {HI} column density, impact parameter and galaxy color. (4) Ionization parameter does not depend on azimuthal angle. We suggest that the partial Lyman limit metallicity bimodality is not driven by a spatial azimuthal bimodality. Our results are consistent with simulations where the {CGM} is complex and outflowing, accreting, and recycled gas are well-homogenized at \$z{\textless}0.7\$. The presence of low metallicity gas at all orientations suggests that cold streams of accreting filaments are not necessarily aligned with the galaxy plane at low redshifts or intergalactic transfer may dominate. Finally, our results support simulations showing that strong metal absorption can mask the presence of low metallicity gas in integrated line-of-sight {CGM} metallicities.},

Galaxies of all luminosity L{\textgreater}0.01L* and spectral type are surrounded by a diffuse and ionized circumgalactic medium ({CGM}), whose baryonic mass is estimated at {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}(10.5 +/- 0.3) Msun for a constant N\_H.

	abstract = {We analyze the absorption and emission-line profiles produced by a set of simple, cool gas wind models motivated by galactic-scale outflow observations. We implement monte carlo radiative transfer techniques that track the propagation of scattered and fluorescent photons to generate 1D spectra and 2D spectral images. We focus on the {MgII} 2796,28303 doublet and {FeII} {UV}1 multiplet at {\textasciitilde}2600A, but the results are applicable to other transitions that trace outflows (e.g. {NaI}, Lya, {SiII}). By design, the resonance transitions show blue-shifted absorption but one also predicts strong resonance and fine-structure line-emission at roughly the systemic velocity. This line-emission `fills-in' the absorption reducing the equivalent width by up to 50\%, shift the absorption-lin centroid by tens of km/s, and reduce the effective opacity near systemic. Analysis of cool gas outflows that ignores this line-emission may incorrectly infer that the gas is partially covered, measure asignificantly lower peak optical depth, and/or conclude that gas at systemic velocity is absent. Because the {FeII} lines are connected by optically-thin transitions to fine-structure levels, their profiles more closely reproduce the intrinsic opacity of the wind. Together these results naturally explain the absorption and emission-line characteristics observed for star-forming galaxies at z{\textless}1. We also study a scenario promoted to describe the outflows of z{\textasciitilde}3 Lyman break galaxies and find prfiles inconsistent with the observations due to scattered photon emission. Although line-emission complicates the analysis of absorption-line profiles, the surface brightness profiles offer a unique means of assessing the morphology and size of galactic-scale winds. Furthermore, the kinematics and line-ratios offer powerful diagnostics of outflows, motivating deep, spatially-extended spectroscopic observations.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04771},
	abstract = {The existence of fast moving, cold gas ubiquitously observed in galactic winds is theoretically puzzling, since the destruction time of cold gas is much smaller than its acceleration time. In Gronke \& Oh (2018), we showed that cold gas can accelerate to wind speeds and grow in mass if the radiative cooling time of mixed gas is shorter than the cloud destruction time. Here, we study this process in much more detail, and find remarkably robust cloud acceleration and growth in a wide variety of scenarios. Radiative cooling, rather than the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, enables self-sustaining entrainment of hot gas onto the cloud via cooling-induced pressure gradients. Indeed, growth peaks when the cloud is almost co-moving. The entrainment velocity is of order the cold gas sound speed, and growth is accompanied by cloud pulsations. Growth is also robust to the background wind and initial cloud geometry. In an adiabatic Chevalier-Clegg type wind, for instance, the mass growth rate is constant. Although growth rates are similar with magnetic fields, cloud morphology changes dramatically, with low density, magnetically supported filaments which have a small mass fraction but dominate by volume. This could bias absorption line observations. Cloud growth from entraining and cooling hot gas can potentially account for the cold gas content of the {CGM}. It can also fuel star formation in the disk as cold gas recycled in a galactic fountain accretes and cools halo gas. We speculate that galaxy-scale simulations should converge in cold gas mass once cloud column densities of \$\{{\textbackslash}rm N\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{18\} {\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\}\$ are resolved.},

	doi = {10.1093/mnras/stz1708},
	abstract = {Galaxies are surrounded by massive gas reservoirs (i.e. the circumgalactic medium; {CGM}) which play a key role in their evolution. The properties of the {CGM}, which are dependent on a variety of internal and environmental factors, are often inferred from absorption line surveys which rely on a limited number of single lines-of-sight. In this work we present an analysis of 28 galaxy haloes selected from the Auriga project, a cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical zoom-in simulation suite of isolated Milky Way-mass galaxies, to understand the impact of {CGM} diversity on observational studies. Although the Auriga haloes are selected to populate a narrow range in halo mass, our work demonstrates that the {CGM} of L* galaxies is extremely diverse: column densities of commonly observed species span {\textasciitilde}3-4 dex and their covering fractions range from {\textasciitilde}5 to 90 per cent. Despite this diversity, we identify the following correlations: 1) the covering fractions ({CF}) of hydrogen and metals of the Auriga haloes positively correlate with stellar mass, 2) the {CF} of H I, C {IV}, and Si {II} anticorrelate with active galactic nucleus luminosity due to ionization effects, and 3) the {CF} of H I, C {IV}, and Si {II} positively correlate with galaxy disc fraction due to outflows populating the {CGM} with cool and dense gas. The Auriga sample demonstrates striking diversity within the {CGM} of L* galaxies, which poses a challenge for observations reconstructing {CGM} characteristics from limited samples, and also indicates that long-term merger assembly history and recent star formation are not the dominant sculptors of the {CGM}.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04333},
	abstract = {The connections among galaxies, the dark matter halos where they form and the properties of the large-scale Cosmic Web still need to be completely disentangled. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation {TNG}100 of the {IllustrisTNG} suite to quantify the effects played by the large-scale density field and the Cosmic Web morphology on the relation between halo mass and galaxy stellar mass. We select objects with total dynamical mass in the range \${\textbackslash}geq 6.3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} h {\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ up to a few \$10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ between redshift \$z=4\$ and redshift \$z=0\$. A Cosmic Web class (knot, filament, sheet, void) is assigned to each region of the volume using a density field deformation tensor-based method. We find that galaxy stellar mass strongly correlates with total dynamical mass and formation time, and more weakly with large-scale overdensity and Cosmic Web class. The latter two quantities correlate with each other, but are not entirely degenerate. Furthermore, we find that at fixed halo mass, galaxies with stellar mass lower than the median value are more likely to be found in voids and sheets, whereas galaxies with stellar mass higher than the median are more likely to be found in filaments and knots. The effect is stronger at redshift \$z{\textbackslash}leq 1\$, but it decreases at higher redshift. We predict that this effect should already be measurable from available galaxy surveys. Finally, we find that the dependence on environment is stronger for satellites than for centrals, and discuss the physical implications of these results.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02983},
	abstract = {We present a survey for metal absorption systems traced by neutral oxygen over \$3.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 6.5\$. Our survey uses Keck/{ESI} and {VLT}/X-Shooter spectra of 199 {QSOs} with redshifts up to 6.6. In total we detect 74 O I absorbers, of which 57 are separated from the background {QSO} by more than 5000 km/s. We use a maximum likelihood approach to fit the distribution of O I \${\textbackslash}lambda\$1302 equivalent widths in bins of redshift, and from this determine the evolution in number density of absorbers with \$W\_\{1302\} {\textgreater} 0.05\$ angstroms. We find that the number density does not monotonically increase with decreasing redshift, as would naively be expected from the buildup of metal-enriched circumgalactic gas with time. The number density over \$4.9 {\textless} z {\textless} 5.7\$ is a factor of 1.7--4.1 lower (68\% confidence) than over \$5.7 {\textless} z {\textless} 6.5\$, with a lower value at \$z {\textless} 5.7\$ favored with 99\% confidence. This decrease suggests that the fraction of metals in a low-ionization phase is larger at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 6\$ than at lower redshifts. Absorption from highly ionized metals traced by C {IV} is also weaker in higher-redshift O I systems, supporting this picture. The evolution of O I absorbers implies that metal-enriched circumgalactic gas at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 6\$ is undergoing an ionization transition driven by a strengthening ultraviolet background. This in turn suggests that the reionization of the diffuse intergalactic medium may still be ongoing at or only recently ended by this epoch.},

	abstract = {The warm (\${\textbackslash}log{\textasciitilde}T{\textbackslash}approx5\$) gas is an important gaseous component in the galaxy baryonic cycle. We built a 2-dimension disk-{CGM} model to study the warm gas distribution of the Milky Way ({MW}) using the absorption line surveys of Si {IV} and O {VI}. In this model, the disk component of both ions has the same density profile (\$n(r, z)=n\_0{\textbackslash}exp(-{\textbar}z{\textbar}/z\_0){\textbackslash}exp(-r/r\_0)\$) with a scale height of \$z\_0=2.6{\textbackslash}pm0.4{\textbackslash}rm{\textasciitilde}kpc\$ and a scale length of \$r\_0=6.1{\textbackslash}pm1.2{\textbackslash}rm{\textasciitilde}kpc\$. For this disk component, we calculate the warm gas mass of \${\textbackslash}log(M/M\_{\textbackslash}odot)=(7.6{\textbackslash}pm0.2)-{\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}frac\{Z\}\{Z\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. The similar disk density profiles and total masses of Si {IV} and O {VI}-bearing gas set constraints on the ionization mechanisms. We suggest that the warm gas disk might be dominated by the Galactic fountain mechanism, which ejects and recycles gas to set both the scale height and the scale length of the warm gas disk. The {CGM} component in our model has a dependence on Galactic latitude with a higher column density along the direction perpendicular to the Galactic plane (\$b=90{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$) than the column density along the radial direction (\$b=0{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$). The column density difference between these two directions is \$0.82{\textbackslash}pm0.32{\textbackslash}rm{\textasciitilde}dex\$ at \$6.3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ for both ions. This difference may be due to the enrichment of Galactic feedback to the entire {CGM}, or an additional interaction layer between the warm gas disk and the {CGM}; existing data cannot distinguish between these two scenarios. If this higher column density at \$b=90{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ is for the entire {CGM}, the total warm {CGM} mass is \${\textbackslash}log(M/M\_{\textbackslash}odot){\textbackslash}approx(9.5-9.8)-{\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}frac\{Z\}\{0.5Z\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ within the {MW} virial radius of \$250{\textbackslash}rm{\textasciitilde}kpc\$.},

We show that supernova feedback has a significant impact on both the inflowing and outflowing circumgalactic medium by driving outflows, reducing diffuse inflow rates, and by increasing the neutral fraction of inflowing gas. By temporally stacking simulation outputs we find that significant net mass exchange occurs between inflowing and outflowing phases: none of the phases are mass-conserving. In particular, we find that the mass in neutral outflowing hydrogen declines exponentially with radius as gas flows outwards from the halo centre. This is likely caused by a combination of both fountain-like cycling processes and gradual photo/collisional ionization of outflowing gas. Our simulations do not predict the presence of fast-moving neutral outflows in the {CGM}. Neutral outflows instead move with modest radial velocities ({\textasciitilde} 50 kms{\textasciicircum}-1), and the majority of the kinetic energy is associated with tangential rather than radial motion.},

	abstract = {We have used the {NIHAO} simulations to explore how supernovae ({SNe}) affect star formation in galaxies. We find that {SN} feedback operates on all scales from the interstellar medium ({ISM}) to several virial radii. {SNe} regulate star formation by preventing condensation of {HI} into H\$\_2\$ and by moving cold neutral gas to the hot {HII} phase. The first effect explains why the cold neutral gas in dwarf galaxies forms stars inefficiently. The second maintains the hot {ISM} of massive galaxies ({HII} vents out at lower masses). At \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}{\textbackslash}simeq 67\{{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},km{\textbackslash},s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, the outflow rate follows the relation: \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm out\}=23{\textbackslash},(v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}/67\{{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},km{\textbackslash},s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}){\textasciicircum}\{-4.6\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$. \$20{\textbackslash}\%\$ to \$70{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the gas expelled from galaxies escapes from the halo (ejective feedback) but outflows are dominated by cold swept-up gas, most of which falls back onto the galaxy on a \${\textbackslash}sim 1{\textbackslash},\$Gyr timescale. This `fountain feedback' reduces the masses of galaxies by a factor of two to four, since gas spends half to three quarter of its time in the fountain. Less than \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the ejected gas mixes with the hot circumgalactic medium and this gas is usually not reaccreted. On scales as large as \$6r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$, galactic winds divert the incoming gas from cosmic filaments and prevent if from accreting onto galaxies (pre-emptive feedback). This process is the main reason for the low baryon content of ultradwarves.},

	abstract = {We report the formation of bound star clusters in a sample of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of z{\textgreater}5 galaxies from the {FIRE} project. We find that bound clusters preferentially form in high-pressure clouds with gas surface densities over 10{\textasciicircum}4 Msun pc{\textasciicircum}-2, where the cloud-scale star formation efficiency is near unity and young stars born in these regions are gravitationally bound at birth. These high-pressure clouds are compressed by feedback-driven winds and/or collisions of smaller clouds/gas streams in highly gas-rich, turbulent environments. The newly formed clusters follow a power-law mass function of {dN}/{dM}{\textasciitilde}M{\textasciicircum}-2. The cluster formation efficiency is similar across galaxies with stellar masses of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}7-10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun at z{\textgreater}5. The age spread of cluster stars is typically a few Myrs and increases with cluster mass. The metallicity dispersion of cluster members is {\textasciitilde}0.08 dex in [Z/H] and does not depend on cluster mass significantly. Our findings support the scenario that present-day old globular clusters ({GCs}) were formed during relatively normal star formation in high-redshift galaxies. Simulations with a stricter/looser star formation model form a factor of a few more/fewer bound clusters per stellar mass formed, while the shape of the mass function is unchanged. Simulations with a lower local star formation efficiency form more stars in bound clusters. The simulated clusters are larger than observed {GCs} due to finite resolution. Our simulations are among the first cosmological simulations that form bound clusters self-consistently in a wide range of high-redshift galaxies.},

Using this simulation, we study the evolution of the intergalactic medium in between these two halos at unprecedented resolution. At 5{\textgreater}z{\textgreater}3, the two halos are found to lie in a large intergalactic sheet, or "pancake", consisting of multiple co-planar dense filaments along which nearly all halos with M\_v{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}9M\_\{sun\} are located. This sheet collapses at z{\textasciitilde}5 from the merger of two smaller sheets. The strong shock generated by this merger leads to thermal instabilities in the post-shock region, and to a shattering of the sheet resulting in {\textless}{\textasciitilde}kpc scale clouds with temperatures of T{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}2x10{\textasciicircum}4K and densities of n{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}, which are pressure confined in a hot medium with T{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}6K and n{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}.

Their chemical composition is pristine, having zero metalicity, similar to several recently observed systems. Since these systems form far from any galaxies, these results are robust to galaxy formation physics, resulting purely from the collapse of large scale structure and radiative cooling, provided sufficient spatial resolution is available.},

E-{MOSAICS} incorporates models describing the formation, evolution and disruption of star clusters into the {EAGLE} galaxy formation simulations, enabling the examination of the co-evolution of star clusters and their host galaxies in a fully cosmological context. A fraction of the star formation rate of dense gas is assumed to yield a cluster population; this fraction, and the population's initial properties, are governed by the physical properties of the natal gas. The subsequent evolution and disruption of the entire cluster population is followed accounting for two-body relaxation, stellar evolution, and gravitational shocks induced by the local tidal field. This introductory paper presents a detailed description of the model and initial results from a suite of 10 simulations of \${\textbackslash}sim L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}star\$ galaxies with disc-like morphologies at \$z=0\$. The simulations broadly reproduce key observed characteristics of young star clusters and globular clusters ({GCs}), without invoking separate formation mechanisms for each population. The simulated {GCs} are the surviving population of massive clusters formed at early epochs (\$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim1-2\$), when the characteristic pressures and surface densities of star-forming gas were significantly higher than observed in local galaxies. We examine the influence of the star formation and assembly histories of galaxies on their cluster populations, finding that (at similar present-day mass) earlier-forming galaxies foster a more massive and disruption-resilient cluster population, while galaxies with late mergers are capable of forming massive clusters even at late cosmic epochs.

Despite this success, the Bower et al. model fails to match some observational constraints and certain aspects of its physical implementation are not as realistic as we would like. The model described in this work includes substantially updated physics, taking into account developments in our understanding over the past decade, and removes certain limiting assumptions made by this (and most other) semi-analytic models. This allows it to be exploited reliably in high-redshift and low mass regimes. Furthermore, we have performed an exhaustive search of model parameter space to find a particular set of model parameters which produce results in good agreement with a wide range of observational data (luminosity functions, galaxy sizes and dynamics, clustering, colours, metal content) over a wide range of redshifts.

Accordingly, it is timely to assess critically some of the assumptions of traditional semi-analytic galaxy formation models. We use the Eagle simulations to assess assumptions built into the Galform semi-analytic model, focussing on those relating to baryon cycling, angular momentum and feedback. We show that the assumption in Galform that newly formed stars have the same specific angular momentum as the total disc leads to a significant overestimate of the total stellar specific angular momentum of disc galaxies. In Eagle, stars form preferentially out of low specific angular momentum gas in the interstellar medium ({ISM}) due to the assumed gas density threshold for stars to form, leading to more realistic galaxy sizes. We find that stellar mass assembly is similar between Galform and Eagle but that the evolution of gas properties is different, with various indications that the rate of baryon cycling in Eagle is slower than is assumed in Galform. Finally, by matching individual galaxies between Eagle and Galform, we find that an artificial dependence of {AGN} feedback and gas infall rates on halo mass doubling events in Galform drives most of the scatter in stellar mass between individual objects. Put together our results suggest that the Galform semi-analytic model can be significantly improved in light of recent advances.},

Cooling flow solutions can thus be used as a benchmark for observations and simulations to constrain the timing and extent of feedback heating. Using analytic calculations and idealized 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we show that for a given halo mass and cooling function, steady-state cooling flows form a single-parameter family of solutions, while initially hydrostatic gaseous haloes converge on one of these solutions within a cooling time. The solution is thus fully determined once either the mass inflow rate \$\{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\}\$ or the total halo gas mass are known. In the Milky Way halo, a cooling flow with \$\{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\}\$ equal to the star formation rate predicts a ratio of the cooling time to the free-fall time of ∼10, similar to some feedback-regulated models. This solution also correctly predicts observed \${\textbackslash}rm\{O{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}small {VII}\}\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}rm\{O{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}small {VIII}\}\}\$ absorption columns, and the gas density profile implied by \${\textbackslash}rm\{O{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}small {VII}\}\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}rm\{O{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}small {VIII}\}\}\$ emission. These results suggest ongoing heating by feedback may be negligible in the inner Milky-Way halo. Extending similar solutions out to the cooling radius however underpredicts observed \${\textbackslash}rm\{O{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}small {VI}\}\}\$ columns around the Milky-Way and around other low-redshift star-forming galaxies. This can be reconciled with the successes of the cooling flow model with either a mechanism which preferentially heats the \${\textbackslash}rm\{O{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}small {VI}\}\}\$-bearing outer halo, or alternatively if \${\textbackslash}rm\{O{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}small {VI}\}\}\$ traces cool photoionized gas beyond the accretion shock. We also demonstrate that the entropy profiles of some of the most relaxed clusters are reasonably well described by a cooling flow solution.},

	abstract = {Hot ionized gas is observed in the local vicinity of our galaxy through spectral absorption features. The most common hypothesis is that this gas forms a halo surrounding our Milky-Way ({MW}), in collisional ionization equilibrium. In this paper we investigate the elemental abundance of this hot and ionized local gas. We use a 2.4 Ms stacked X-ray spectrum of the bright blazar 3C 273 and probe the local absorption features. Using ion-by-ion fitting of the X-ray absorption lines we derive the column density of each ionization species. Based on the column densities we reconstruct the Absorption measure distribution ({AMD}), namely the hydrogenic column density as a function of temperature. We report the elemental abundances of C, N, Ne, and Fe relative to solar O. Previous measurements of local X-ray emission lines in conjunction with the present column densities indicate a scale height of \$1-80\$ kpc and hydrogen number density of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ for the hot ionized gas. Additionally, we detect He-like O lines from the quasar broad line region with velocities of 6400\${\textbackslash}pm\$1500 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$},

	abstract = {The circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) of the Milky Way is mostly obscured by nearby gas in position-velocity space due to the location and motion of observers inside the Galaxy. While most studies on the Milky Way's {CGM} to date focus on easier-to-detect high-velocity gas (\${\textbar}v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {LSR}\}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}gtrsim100\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$), it only partially represents the entire {CGM}, resulting in substantial biases. Here we investigate four observational biases inherent in the studies of the Milky Way's {CGM} with mock observations on a Milky-Way analog from the {FOGGIE} simulations. With a mock observer placed inside the simulated galaxy at off-center locations consistent with that of the Sun, we find that: (i) high-velocity-based studies could miss \${\textbackslash}sim\$2/3 of the Milky Way's {CGM} mass; (ii) once we correct velocities from the local standard of rest to the galaxy's rest frame, gas infall rate (\${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\$) for cold gas observable in {HI} 21cm emission is reduced from -0.25 M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ to -0.05 M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, while \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\$ for gases at warmer phases are less affected; (iii) {OVI} and {NV} are likely to be good {UV} tracers of the Milky Way's outer {CGM} (\$r{\textbackslash}gtrsim\$15 kpc), whereas {CIV} maybe less sensitive; (iv) because of the clumpiness and radial distribution of {CGM} gas, the scatter in ionic column densities is a factor of 2 higher when the {CGM} is observed from the inside-out versus from external views. Our work highlights that observations of the Milky Way's {CGM}, especially those using {HI} emission and {UV} absorption lines, are highly biased because we reside inside the Galaxy. We demonstrate that these biases can be quantified and calibrated through synthetic observations with simulated Milky-Way analogs.},

	abstract = {We present models of {CO}(1-0) emission from Milky Way-mass galaxies at redshift zero in the {FIRE}-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations. We calculate the molecular abundances by post-processing the simulations with an equilibrium chemistry solver while accounting for the effects of local sources, and determine the emergent {CO}(1-0) emission using a line radiative transfer code. We find that the results depend strongly on the shielding length assumed, which in our models sets the attenuation of the incident {UV} radiation field. Commonly used choices for the shielding length, such as the Jeans length, result in {CO} abundances that are too high at a given H\$\_2\$ abundance. We find that a model with a distribution of shielding lengths, which has a median shielding length of \${\textbackslash}sim 3\$ pc in cold gas (\$T {\textless} 300\$ K) for both {CO} and H\$\_\{2\}\$, is able to reproduce both the observed {CO}(1-0) luminosity and inferred {CO}-to-H\$\_\{2\}\$ conversion factor at a given star formation rate compared with observations. We suggest that this short shielding length can be thought of as a subgrid model which controls the amount of radiation that penetrates giant molecular clouds.},

We study three cases of galaxy asymmetry dividing each galaxy in two halves using the plane (i) perpendicular to the \${\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}texttt\{velocity\}\$ direction, differentiating the galaxy part approaching to the cluster center, hereafter dubbed as the "leading half", and the opposite one "trailing half", (ii) perpendicular to the \${\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}texttt\{radial\}\$ position of the satellite to the centre of the cluster, (iii) that maximizes the star-formation rate (\${\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\$) difference between the two halves.

These results suggest that ram pressure ({RP}) is boosting the star formation by gas compression in the leading half, and transporting the gas to the trailing half. This effect is more pronounced in satellites of intermediate stellar masses \${\textbackslash}rm 10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5-10.5\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, with gas masses above \${\textbackslash}rm 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, and located within one virial radius or in the most massive clusters. In (iii) we find an alignment between the velocity and the vector perpendicular to the plane that maximizes the \${\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\$ difference between the two halves. It suggests that finding this plane in real galaxies can provide insights into the velocity direction.},

	abstract = {During the last years, Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ nebulae have been routinely detected around high-z, radio-quiet quasars ({RQQs}) thanks to the advent of sensitive integral field spectrographs. Constraining the physical properties of the Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ nebulae is crucial for a full understanding of the circum-galactic medium ({CGM}), which is a venue of feeding and feedback processes. The most luminous quasars are privileged test-beds to study these processes, given their large ionizing fluxes and dense {CGM} environments in which they are expected to be embedded. We aim at characterizing the rest-frame {UV} emission lines in the {CGM} around a hyper-luminous, broad emission line, {RQQ} at z{\textasciitilde}3.6, that exhibits powerful outflows at both nuclear and host galaxy scales. We analyze {VLT}/{MUSE} observations of the quasar J1538+08 and perform a search for extended {UV} emission lines to characterize its morphology, emissivity, kinematics and metal content. We report the discovery of a very luminous (\${\textbackslash}sim2 {\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{44\}{\textasciitilde}erg{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$), giant Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ nebula and a likely associated extended {CIV} nebula.

The Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line profile exhibits a significant asymmetry towards negative velocity values at 20-30 kpc south of the quasar and is well parameterized by two Gaussian components: a narrow (\${\textbackslash}sigma\${\textasciitilde}\$470{\textasciitilde}km{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) systemic one plus a broad (\${\textbackslash}sigma\${\textasciitilde}1200 \$km{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$), blueshifted ({\textasciitilde}1500 \$km{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) one. Our analysis of the {MUSE} observation of J1538+08 reveals metal-enriched {CGM} around this hyper-luminous quasar and our detection of blueshifted emission in the line profile of the Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ nebula suggests that powerful nuclear outflows can propagate through the {CGM} over tens of kpc.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07214},
	abstract = {Recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are able to reproduce numerous statistical properties of galaxies that are consistent with observational data. Yet, the adopted subgrid models strongly affect the simulation outcomes, limiting the predictive power of these simulations. In this work, we perform a suite of isolated galactic disk simulations under the \{{\textbackslash}it {SMUGGLE}\} framework and investigate how different subgrid models affect the properties of giant molecular clouds ({GMCs}). We employ \{{\textbackslash}sc astrodendro\}, a hierarchical clump-finding algorithm, to identify {GMCs} in the simulations. We find that different choices of subgrid star formation efficiency, \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$, and stellar feedback channels, yield dramatically different mass and spatial distributions for the {GMC} populations. Without feedback, the mass function of {GMCs} has a shallower power-law slope and extends to higher mass ranges compared to runs with feedback. Moreover, higher \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ results in faster molecular gas consumption and steeper mass function slopes. Feedback also suppresses power in the two-point correlation function ({TPCF}) of the spatial distribution of {GMCs}. Specifically, radiative feedback strongly reduces the {TPCF} on scales below 0.2{\textasciitilde}kpc, while supernova feedback reduces power on scales above 0.2{\textasciitilde}kpc. Finally, runs with higher \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ exhibit a higher {TPCF} than runs with lower \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$, because the dense gas is depleted more efficiently thereby facilitating the formation of well-structured supernova bubbles. We argue that comparing simulated and observed {GMC} populations can help better constrain subgrid models in the next-generation of galaxy formation simulations.},

	title = {Positive feedback at the disc-halo interface},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06012},
	abstract = {The flat star formation ({SF}) history of the Milky Way ({MW}) requires gas in the Galactic disc to be replenished, most likely from a reservoir outside the Galaxy. Such a replenishment may be achieved by a form of `positive' feedback, whereby {SF} feedback creates a Galactic fountain cycle that collects and cools additional gas from the hot halo surrounding the Galaxy. In this paper we present a model of this process for the {MW}. A section of the Galactic disc is allowed to form stars which subsequently explode as supernovae ({SNe}) and send gas out into the hot halo. The gas that is sent out is colder than the hot halo gas and, as it mixes, the halo gas is cooled, providing fuel for further {SF} as the mixture falls back onto the Galactic disc. We find that this process can be sufficient to maintain a roughly-constant cold gas mass in the {MW} over at least 3 Gyr. Our results further suggest that there is a positive feedback trend whereby increasing {SF} leads to an increase in the cold gas budget at average {SF} rates below 0.5 solar masses per year but above which becomes negative, where further increasing the {SFR} causes the cold gas budget to decrease. We have constructed an analytical model for this that reproduces the data well and could have profound implications for galaxy evolution in feedback-dominated regimes.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05003},
	abstract = {Starburst galaxies have elevated star formation rates ({SFRs}) for their stellar mass. In Ellison et al. (2018) we used integral field unit ({IFU}) maps of star formation rate surface density (Sigma\_SFR) and stellar mass surface density (Sigma\_*) to show that starburst galaxies in the local universe are driven by {SFRs} that are preferentially boosted in their central regions. Here, we present molecular gas maps obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array ({ALMA}) observatory for 12 central starburst galaxies at z{\textasciitilde}0 drawn from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory ({MaNGA}) survey. The {ALMA} and {MaNGA} data are well matched in spatial resolution, such that the {ALMA} maps of molecular gas surface density (Sigma\_H2) can be directly compared with {MaNGA} maps at kpc-scale resolution. The combination of Sigma\_H2, Sigma\_* and Sigma\_SFR at the same resolution allow us to investigate whether central starbursts are driven primarily by enhancements in star formation efficiency ({SFE}) or by increased gas fractions. By computing offsets from the resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (Sigma\_H2 vs. Sigma\_SFR) and the molecular gas main sequence (Sigma\_* vs. Sigma\_H2), we conclude that the primary driver of the central starburst is an elevated {SFE}. We also show that the enhancement in Sigma\_SFR is accompanied by a dilution in O/H, consistent with a triggering that is induced by metal poor gas inflow. These observational signatures are found in both undisturbed (9/12 galaxies in our sample) and recently merged galaxies, indicating that both interactions and secular mechanisms contribute to central starbursts.},

However, the metallicity of such extended haloes is still poorly understood. We perform a detailed analysis on a large sample of 80 quasars at z\${\textbackslash}sim\$3 based on {MUSE}-{VLT} data. We find clear evidence of extended emission of the {UV} nebular lines C {IV} \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}1549 and He {II} \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}1640 for about 18\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the sample, while C {III}] \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}1909 is only marginally detected in a few objects.

C {IV} and He {II} show a radial decline much steeper than Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}, while C {III}] shows a shallower profile similar to Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} in the inner 45 kpc. We infer that the average metallicity of the circumgalactic gas within the central 30-50 kpc is \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.5 solar, or even higher. However, we also find evidence of a component of the Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} haloes, which has much weaker metal emission lines relative to Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}. We suggest that the high metallicity of the circumgalactic medium within the central 30-50 kpc is associated with chemical pre-enrichment by past quasar-driven outflows and that there is a more extended component of the {CGM} that has much lower metallicity and likely associated with near-pristine gas accreted from the intergalactic medium. We show that our observational results are in good quantitative agreement with the expectations of the {FABLE} cosmological simulations.},

We apply the 3D radiation transfer code radmc-3d to model 13CO (J=1-0) line emission from the simulated clouds. We train two {CASI}-3d models: {ME}1 predicts only the position of feedback, while {MF} predicts the fraction of the mass coming from feedback in each voxel. We adopt 75\% of the synthetic observations as the training set and assess the accuracy of the two models with the remaining data. We demonstrate that model {ME}1 identifies bubbles in simulated data with 95\% accuracy, and model {MF} predicts the bubble mass within 4\% of the true value. We use bubbles previously visually identified in Taurus in 13CO to validate the models and show both perform well on the highest confidence bubbles. We apply our two models on the full 98 deg2 {FCRAO} 13CO survey of the Taurus cloud. Models {ME}1 and {MF} predict feedback gas mass of 2894 M and 302 M, respectively. When including a correction factor for missing energy due to the limited velocity range of the 13CO data cube, model {ME}1 predicts feedback kinetic energies of 4.0*1e46 ergs and 1.5*1e47 ergs with/without subtracting the cloud velocity gradient. Model {MF} predicts feedback kinetic energy of 9.6*1e45 ergs and 2.8*1e46 ergs with/without subtracting the cloud velocity gradient. Model {ME}1 predicts bubble locations and properties consistent with previous visually identified bubbles. However, model {MF} demonstrates that feedback properties computed based on visual identifications are significantly overestimated due to line of sight confusion and contamination from background and foreground gas.},

After subtracting the best-fit model of a rotating disk, we kinematically identify two residual components in the channel maps. Both observing simulations and analysis of dirty images confirm that these two subcomponents are not artificially created by noise fluctuations and beam deconvolution. One of the two has a velocity offset of 200 km/s and a physical separation of 2 kpc from the primary disk and is located along the kinematic minor axis of disk rotation. We conclude that this gas component is falling into the galaxy from a direction perpendicular to the disk rotation. The accretion of such small non-corotating gas components could stimulate violent disk instability, driving radial gas inflows into the center of galaxies and leading to formation of in-situ clumps such as identified in dust continuum and {CO}. We require more theoretical studies on high gas fraction mergers with mass ratio of 1:{\textgreater}10 to verify this process.},

	abstract = {Single-phase photoionization equilibrium ({PIE}) models are often used to infer the underlying physical properties of galaxy halos probed in absorption with ions at different ionization potentials. To incorporate the effects of turbulence, we use the {MAIHEM} code to model an isotropic turbulent medium exposed to a redshift zero metagalactic {UV} background, while tracking the ionizations, recombinations, and species-by-species radiative cooling for a wide range of ions. By comparing observations and simulations over a wide range of turbulent velocities, densities, and metallicity with a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we find that {MAIHEM} models provide an equally good fit to the observed low-ionization species compared to {PIE} models, while reproducing at the same time high-ionization species such as {\textbackslash}ion\{Si\}\{4\} and {\textbackslash}ion\{O\}\{6\}.

	abstract = {Galaxy mergers are a major evolutionary transformation whose effects are borne out by a plethora of observations and numerical simulations. However, most previous simulations have used idealised, isolated, binary mergers and there has not been significant progress on studying statistical samples of galaxy mergers in large cosmological simulations. We present a sample of 27,691 post-merger ({PM}) galaxies (\$0{\textbackslash}le z {\textbackslash}le 1\$) identified from {IllustrisTNG}: a cosmological, large box, magneto-hydrodynamical simulation suite. The {PM} sample spans a wide range of merger and galaxy properties (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$, \${\textbackslash}mu\$, \$f\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{gas\}\$). We demonstrate that star forming ({SF}) {PMs} exhibit enhanced star formation rates ({SFRs}) on average by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 2\$, while the passive {PMs} show no statistical enhancement. We find that the {SFR} enhancements: (1) show no dependence on redshift, (2) anti-correlate with the {PM}'s stellar mass, and (3) correlate with the gas fraction of the {PM}'s progenitors. However, {SF} {PMs} show stronger enhancements which may indicate other processes being at play (e.g., gas phase, feedback efficiency). Although the {SFR} enhancement correlates mildly with the merger mass ratio, the more abundant minor mergers (\$0.1 {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}mu {\textless} 0.3 \$) still contribute \${\textbackslash}sim 50{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the total {SFR} enhancement. By tracing the {PM} sample forward in time, we find that galaxy mergers can drive significant {SFR} enhancements which decay over \${\textbackslash}sim 0.5\$ Gyr independent of the merger mass ratio, although the decay timescale is dependent on the simulation resolution. The strongest merger-driven starburst galaxies evolve to be passive/quenched on faster timescales than their controls.},

Furthermore, all candidates are in the luminosity range 0.18-1.15 L*\$(Ly\{ {\textbackslash}alpha \}, z = 5.7)\$ indicating that the environment of {CIV} systems within 200 pkpc is populated by the faint end of the Ly\$\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ luminosity function. We report a 0.28 L*\$(Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\})\$ galaxy at a separation of \${\textbackslash}rho = 10\$ pkpc from a strong {CIV} absorption (log10({NCIV}[cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$]) = 14.52) at \$z\_\{{CIV}\} = 5.72419\$. The prevalence of sub-L*(Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$) galaxies in the proximity of z \${\textgreater} 4.9\$ {CIV} systems suggest that the absorbing material is rather young, likely ejected in the recent past of the galaxies at these redshifts. The connection between faint {LAEs} and high-ionization absorption systems reported in this work, is potentially a consequence of the role of low mass galaxies in the early evolution of the circum-galactic and intergalactic media.},

	abstract = {Satellites constitute an important fraction of the overall galaxy population and are believed to form in dark matter subhalos. Here we use the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation {TNG}100 to investigate how the formation histories of subhalos affect the properties and evolution of their host galaxies. We use a scaled formation time (\$a\_\{{\textbackslash}rm nf\}\$) to characterize the mass assembly histories of the subhalos before they are accreted by massive host halos. We find that satellite galaxies in young subhalos (low \$a\_\{{\textbackslash}rm nf\}\$) are less massive and more gas rich, and have stronger star formation and a higher fraction of ex situ stellar mass than satellites in old subhalos (high \$a\_\{{\textbackslash}rm nf\}\$). Furthermore, these low \$a\_\{{\textbackslash}rm nf\}\$ satellites require longer timescales to be quenched as a population than the high \$a\_\{{\textbackslash}rm nf\}\$ counterparts. We find very different merger histories between satellites in fast accretion ({FA}, \$a\_\{{\textbackslash}rm nf\}{\textless}1.3\$) and slow accretion ({SA}, \$a\_\{{\textbackslash}rm nf\}{\textgreater}1.3\$) subhalos. For {FA} satellites, the galaxy merger frequency dramatically increases just after accretion, which enhances the star formation at accretion. While, for {SA} satellites, the mergers occur smoothly and continuously across the accretion time. Moreover, mergers with {FA} satellites happen mainly after accretion, while a contrary trend is found for {SA} satellites. Our results provide insight into the evolution and star formation quenching of the satellite population.},

	abstract = {We explore the expected galaxy environments of {CIV} absorbers at z{\textgreater}5 using the Technicolor Dawn simulations. These simulations reproduce the observed history of reionization, the z{\textasciitilde}6 galaxy stellar mass function, the Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} forest transmission at z{\textgreater}5, and the {SiIV} column density distribution ({CDD}) at z=5.5. Nonetheless, the {CIV} {CDD} remains underproduced. Comparison with observed {CII}/{SiII} equivalent width ratios and the {CII} line incidence suggests that a low carbon yield accounts for some, but not all, of the {CIV} discrepancy. Alternatively, a density-bounded escape scenario could harden the metagalactic ionizing background more dramatically even than binary stellar evolution, boosting the {CIV} {CDD} into near-agreement with observations. In this case galaxies ionize more efficiently and fewer are required to host a given high-ionization absorber. Absorbers' environments therefore constrain ionizing escape. Regardless of the escape scenario, galaxies correlate with {CIV} absorbers out to 300 proper kpc (pkpc). The correlation strengthens independently with galaxy luminosity and {CIV} column density. Around strong systems (log(N\_CIV) {\textgreater} 14)), the overdensity of galaxies with M\_UV {\textless} -18 or log(L\_Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}) {\textgreater} 41.9 declines from 200-300 within 100 pkpc to 40-60 within 250 pkpc. The previously-suggested association between strong {CIV} absorbers and Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} emitters at z{\textgreater}5 is not expected. It may arise if both populations inhabit large-scale voids, but for different reasons. Although most neighboring galaxies are too faint for {HST}, {JWST} will, with a single pointing, identify {\textasciitilde}10 neighboring galaxies per strong {CIV} absorber at z{\textgreater}5. Ground-based tests of these predictions are possible via deep surveys for Ly\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} emission using integral field units.},

	abstract = {Surveys of the Milky Way ({MW}) and M31 enable detailed studies of stellar populations across ages and metallicities, with the goal of reconstructing formation histories across cosmic time. These surveys motivate key questions for galactic archaeology in a cosmological context: when did the main progenitor of a {MW}/M31-mass galaxy form, and what were the galactic building blocks that formed it? We investigate the formation times and progenitor galaxies of {MW}/M31-mass galaxies using the {FIRE}-2 cosmological simulations, including 6 isolated {MW}/M31-mass galaxies and 6 galaxies in Local Group ({LG})-like pairs at z = 0. We examine main progenitor "formation" based on two metrics: (1) transition from primarily ex-situ to in-situ stellar mass growth and (2) mass dominance compared to other progenitors. We find that the main progenitor of a {MW}/M31-mass galaxy emerged typically at z {\textasciitilde} 3-4 (11.6-12.2 Gyr ago), while stars in the bulge region (inner 2 kpc) at z = 0 formed primarily in a single main progenitor at z {\textless} 5 ({\textless} 12.6 Gyr ago). Compared with isolated hosts, the main progenitors of {LG}-like paired hosts emerged significantly earlier ({\textbackslash}Delta z {\textasciitilde} 2, {\textbackslash}Delta t {\textasciitilde} 1.6 Gyr), with {\textasciitilde} 4x higher stellar mass at all z {\textgreater} 4 ({\textgreater} 12.2 Gyr ago). This highlights the importance of environment in {MW}/M31-mass galaxy formation, especially at early times. Overall, about 100 galaxies with M\_star {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}5 M\_sun formed a typical {MW}/M31-mass system. Thus, surviving satellites represent a highly incomplete census (by {\textasciitilde} 5x) of the progenitor population.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we provide updated constraints on the bolometric quasar luminosity function ({QLF}) from \$z=0\$ to \$z=7\$. The constraints are based on an observational compilation that includes observations in the rest-frame {IR}, B band, {UV}, soft and hard X-ray in past decades. Our method follows {\textbackslash}citet\{Hopkins2007\} with an updated quasar {SED} model and bolometric and extinction corrections. The new best-fit bolometric quasar luminosity function behaves qualitatively different from the {\textbackslash}citet\{Hopkins2007\} model at high redshift. The bright-end slope is steeper at \$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim 2\$ compared with the old model. The faint-end slope is steeper at \$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim 3\$ and becomes progressively steeper at higher redshifts. The steep faint-end slope we constrain is primarily driven by observations in the rest-frame {UV} and could be affected by the lack of measurements of the faint-end {QLF}. Multi-band observations on the faint-end {QLF} are needed to confirm this trend. The evolutionary pattern of the bolometric {QLF} can be interpreted as an early phase likely dominated by the hierarchical assembly of structures and a late phase likely dominated by the quenching of galaxies. We explore the implications of this model on the ionizing photon production by quasars, the {CXB} spectrum, the {SMBH} mass density and mass functions. The predicted hydrogen ionization rate contributed by quasars is subdominant during the epoch of reionization and only becomes important at \$z{\textbackslash}lesssim 3\$. The predicted {CXB} spectrum, cosmic {SMBH} mass density and {SMBH} mass function are generally consistent with existing observations.},

	abstract = {We present a framework for characterizing the large-scale movement of baryons relative to dark matter in cosmological simulations, requiring only the initial conditions and final state of the simulation. This is performed using the spread metric that quantifies the distance in the final conditions between initially neighbouring particles, and by analysing the baryonic content of final haloes relative to that of the initial Lagrangian regions ({LRs}) defined by their dark matter component. Applying this framework to the simba cosmological simulations, we show that 40 per cent (10 per cent) of cosmological baryons have moved \${\textbackslash}gt 1{\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}\{\}\$ (\$3{\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}\{\}\$) by z = 0, primarily due to entrainment of gas by jets powered by an active galactic nucleus, with baryons moving up to \$12{\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}\{\}\$ away in extreme cases. Baryons decouple from the dynamics of the dark matter component due to hydrodynamic forces, radiative cooling, and feedback processes. As a result, only 60 per cent of the gas content in a given halo at z = 0 originates from its {LR}, roughly independent of halo mass. A typical halo in the mass range Mvir = 1012–1013 M⊙ only retains 20 per cent of the gas originally contained in its {LR}. We show that up to 20 per cent of the gas content in a typical Milky Way-mass halo may originate in the region defined by the dark matter of another halo. This inter-Lagrangian baryon transfer may have important implications for the origin of gas and metals in the circumgalactic medium of galaxies, as well as for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and ‘zoom-in’ simulations.},

	abstract = {We consider the effects of different criteria for determining where stars will form in gas on galactic scales, in simulations with high (1 pc) resolution, with explicitly resolved physics of Giant Molecular Cloud ({GMC}) formation and destruction, and stellar feedback from supernovae, radiation pressure, stellar winds and photoheating.We compare: (1) a self-gravity criterion (based on the local virial parameter and the assumption that self-gravitating gas collapses to high density in a single free-fall time), (2) a fixed density threshold, (3) a molecular-gas law, (4) a temperature threshold, (5) a requirement that the gas be Jeans unstable, (6) a criteria that cooling times be shorter than dynamical times and (7) a convergent-flow criterion. We consider all of these in both a {MilkyWay} ({MW})-like and high-density (starburst or high-redshift) galaxy. With feedback present, all models produce identical integrated star formation rates ({SFRs}), in good agreement with the Kennicutt relation; without feedback all produce ordersof- magnitude excessive {SFRs}. This is totally dependent on feedback and independent of the star formation ({SF}) law, even if the 'local' collapse efficiency is 100 per cent. However, the predicted spatial and density distribution depend strongly on the {SF} criteria. Because cooling rates are generally fast within galaxy discs, and gas is turbulent, criteria (4)-(7) are very 'weak' and spread the {SF} uniformly over most of the disc (down to densities n ̃ 0.01-0.1 cm-3). A molecular criterion (3) localizes to slightly higher densities, but still a wide range; for metallicity near solar, it is almost identical to a fixed density threshold at n ̃ 1 cm-3 (well below the mean density in the central {MW} or starburst systems). A fixed density threshold (2) can always select the highest resolved densities, but must be adjusted both for simulation resolution and individual galaxy properties - the same threshold that works well in {aMW}-like simulation will select nearly all gas in a starburst. Binding criteria (1) tend to adaptively select the largest local overdensities, independent of galaxy model or resolution, and automatically predict clustered {SF}. We argue that this {SF} model (possible with other secondary criteria) is most physically motivated and presents significant numerical advantages in simulations with a large dynamic range. © 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

[Fe/H] measurements and masses estimated from {GLQ} astrometry suggest the lens galaxies lie below the total mass-metallicity relation for early-type galaxies as well as measurements for quasar-galaxy pairs and gravitationally lensed galaxies at comparable redshifts. This difference may arise in part from the dust depletion of Fe. Higher resolution measurements of H and metals (especially undepleted elements) for more {GLQ} absorbers and accurate lens redshifts are needed to confirm these trends.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00590},
	abstract = {Recent zoom-in cosmological simulations have shown that stellar feedback can flatten the inner density profile of the dark matter halo in low-mass galaxies. A correlation between the stellar/gas velocity dispersion (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{star\}\$, \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{gas\}\$) and the specific star formation rate ({sSFR}) is predicted as an observational test of the role of stellar feedback in re-shaping the dark matter density profile. In this work we test the validity of this prediction by studying a sample of star-forming galaxies at \$0.6{\textless}z{\textless}1.0\$ from the {\textbackslash}mbox\{{LEGA}-C\} survey, which provides high signal-to-noise measurements of stellar and gas kinematics. We find that a correlation between \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{star\}\$ (and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{gas\}\$) and {sSFR} indeed exists for galaxies in the lowest mass bin (M\$\_{\textbackslash}ast{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$). This correlation holds for different tracers of star formation, and becomes stronger with redshift. This result generally agrees with the picture that at higher redshifts star formation rate was generally higher, and galaxies at M\$\_{\textbackslash}ast{\textbackslash}lesssim10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ have not yet settled into a disk. As a consequence, they have shallower gravitational potentials more easily perturbed by stellar feedback. The observed correlation between \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{star\}\$ (and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{gas\}\$) and {sSFR} supports the scenario predicted by cosmological simulations, in which feedback-driven outflows cause fluctuations in the gravitation potential which flatten the density profiles of low-mass galaxies.},

The signals from groups of different mass are constrained simultaneously to take care of projection effects of nearby halos. The total {kSZE} flux within halos estimated implies that the gas fraction in halos is about the universal baryon fraction, even in low-mass halos, indicating that the `missing baryons' are found. Various tests performed show that our results are robust against systematic effects, such as contamination by infrared/radio sources and background variations, beam-size effects and contributions from halo exteriors. Combined with the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, our results indicate that the `missing baryons' associated with galaxy groups are contained in warm-hot media with temperatures between \$10{\textasciicircum}5\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}6{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\$.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08213},
	abstract = {We predict, analytically and by simulations, that gas discs tend to survive only in haloes above a threshold mass \${\textbackslash}sim 2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ (stellar mass \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), with only a weak redshift dependence. At lower masses, the disc spins typically flip in less than an orbital time due to mergers associated with a change in the pattern of the feeding cosmic-web streams. This threshold arises from the halo merger rate when accounting for the mass dependence of the ratio of galactic baryons and halo mass. Above the threshold, wet compactions lead to massive central nuggets that allow the longevity of extended clumpy gas rings. Supernova feedback has a major role in disrupting discs below the critical mass, by driving the stellar-to-halo mass ratio that affects the merger rate, by stirring up turbulence and suppressing high-angular-momentum gas supply, and by confining major compactions to the critical mass. Our predictions seem consistent with current observed fractions of gas discs, to be explored by future observations that will resolve galaxies below \$10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ at high redshifts, e.g. by {JWST}.},

We detect 43 galaxies associated with absorbers down to star formation rate ({SFR}) limits of 0.01-0.1 solar masses/yr, found within impact parameters (b) of 250 kpc from the quasar sightline. Excluding the targeted absorbers, we report a high detection rate of 89 per cent and find that most absorption systems are associated with pairs or groups of galaxies (three to eleven members). We note that galaxies with the smallest impact parameters are not necessarily the closest to the absorbing gas in velocity space. Using a multi-wavelength dataset ({UVES}/{HIRES}, {HST}, {MUSE}), we combine metal and {HI} column densities, allowing for derivation of the lower limits of neutral gas metallicity as well as emission line diagnostics ({SFR}, metallicities) of the ionised gas in the galaxies. We find that groups of associated galaxies follow the canonical relations of N({HI}) -- b and W\_r(2796) -- b, defining a region in parameter space below which no absorbers are detected. The metallicity of the {ISM} of associated galaxies, when measured, is higher than the metallicity limits of the absorber. In summary, our findings suggest that the physical properties of the {CGM} of complex group environments would benefit from associating the kinematics of individual absorbing components with each galaxy member.},

Here, we use 3D hydrodynamic simulations to study the pressure-driven fragmentation of cooling gas. This is a complex, multi-stage process, with an initial Rayleigh-Taylor unstable contraction phase which seeds perturbations, followed by a rapid, violent expansion leading to the dispersion of small cold gas `droplets' in the vicinity of the gas cloud. Finally, due to turbulent motions, and cooling, these droplets may coagulate. Our results show that a gas cloud `shatters' if it is sufficiently perturbed out of pressure balance (\${\textbackslash}delta P/P{\textbackslash}sim 1\$), and has a large final overdensity \${\textbackslash}chi\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{f\}\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim 300\$, with only a weak dependence on the cloud size.

We study five quasars at redshifts 3.1 to 4.4 with {AAL} complexes containing from 7 to 18 {CIV} 1548, 1551 systems in high-resolution spectra. These complexes span velocity ranges \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$3600 km/s within \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$8200 km/s of the quasar redshifts. All are highly ionised with no measurable low-ionisation ions like {SiII} or {CII}, and all appear to form in the quasar/host galaxy environments based on evidence for line locking, partial covering of the background light source, strong {NV} absorption, and/or roughly solar metallicities, and on the implausibility of such complexes forming in unrelated intervening galaxies. Most of the lines in all five complexes identify high-speed quasar-driven outflows at velocity shifts \$v{\textbackslash}lesssim -1000\$ km/s. Four of the complexes also have lines at smaller blueshifted velocities that might form in ambient interstellar clouds, low-speed outflows or at feedback interfaces in the host galaxies where high-speed winds impact and shred interstellar clouds. The partial covering we measure in some of the high-speed outflow lines require small absorbing clouds with characteristic sizes \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$1 pc or \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$0.01 pc. The short survival times of these clouds require locations very close to the quasars, or cloud creation in situ at larger distances perhaps via feedback/cloud-shredding processes. The {AAL} complex in one quasar, J1008+3623, includes unusually narrow {CIV} systems at redshifted velocities \$350{\textbackslash}lesssim v{\textbackslash}lesssim640\$ km/s that are excellent candidates for gaseous infall towards the quasar, e.g., ''cold-mode" accretion or a gravitationally-bound galactic fountain.},

	abstract = {As demonstrated in Paper I, the quenching properties of central and satellite galaxies are quite similar as long as both stellar mass and halo mass are controlled. Here we extend the analysis to the size and bulge-to-total light ratio (B/T) of galaxies. In general central galaxies have size-stellar mass and B/T-stellar mass relations different from satellites. However, the differences are eliminated when halo mass is controlled. We also study the dependence of size and B/T on halo-centric distance and find a transitional stellar mass (M\$\_\{*,t\}\$) at given halo mass (M\$\_h\$), which is about one fifth of the mass of the central galaxies in halos of mass M\$\_h\$. The transitional stellar masses for size, B/T and quenched fraction are similar over the whole halo mass range, suggesting a connection between the quenching of star formation and the structural evolution of galaxies. Our analysis further suggests that the classification based on the transitional stellar mass is more fundamental than the central-satellite dichotomy, and provide a more reliable way to understand the environmental effects on galaxy properties. We compare the observational results with the hydro-dynamical simulation, {EAGLE} and the semi-analytic model, L-{GALAXIES}. The {EAGLE} simulation successfully reproduces the similarities of size for centrals and satellites and even M\$\_\{*,t\}\$, while L-{GALAXIES} fails to recover the observational results.},

We aim to search and characterize inflows and outflows of molecular gas in four ultraluminous infrared galaxies ({ULIRGs}) at \$z{\textbackslash}sim0.2-0.3\$ and one distant {QSO} at \$z=6.13\$. Methods. We use Herschel {PACS} and {ALMA} Band 7 observations of the hydroxyl molecule ({OH}) line at rest-frame wavelength 119 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m which in absorption can provide unambiguous evidence for inflows or outflows of molecular gas in nuclear regions of galaxies. Our study contributes to double the number of {OH} observations of luminous systems at \$z{\textbackslash}sim0.2-0.3\$, and push the search for molecular outflows based on the {OH} transition to \$z{\textbackslash}sim6\$. Results. We detect {OH} high-velocity absorption wings in three of the four {ULIRGs}. In two cases, {IRAS} F20036-1547 and {IRAS} F13352+6402, the blueshifted absorption profiles indicate the presence of powerful and fast molecular gas outflows. Consistent with an inside-out quenching scenario, these outflows are depleting the central reservoir of molecular gas at a similar rate than the intense star formation activity. In the case of the starburst-dominated system {IRAS} 10091+4704, we detect an inverted P-Cygni profile that is unique among {ULIRGs} and indicates the presence of a fast (\${\textbackslash}sim400\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) inflow of molecular gas at a rate of \${\textbackslash}sim100{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ towards the central region. Finally, we tentatively detect (\${\textbackslash}sim3{\textbackslash}sigma\$) the {OH} doublet in absorption in the \$z=6.13\$ {QSO} {ULAS} J131911+095051. The {OH} feature is blueshifted with a median velocity that suggests the presence of a molecular outflow, although characterized by a modest molecular mass loss rate of \${\textbackslash}sim200{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. This value is comparable to the small mass outflow rates found in the stacking of the [{CII}] spectra of other \$z{\textbackslash}sim6\$ {QSOs} and suggests that ejective feedback in this phase of the evolution of {ULAS} J131911+095051 has subsided.},

In this work, we demonstrate that the {rSFMS} emerges naturally in {FIRE}-2 zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We make {SFR} and stellar mass maps of the simulated galaxies at a variety of spatial resolutions and star formation averaging time-scales and fit the {rSFMS} using multiple methods from the literature. While the absolute value of the {SFMS} slope depends on the fitting method, the slope is steeper for longer star formation time-scales and lower spatial resolutions regardless of the fitting method employed. We present a toy model that quantitatively captures the dependence of the simulated galaxies' {rSFMS} slope on spatial resolution and use it to illustrate how this dependence can be used to constrain the characteristic mass of star-forming clumps.},

These recently quenched galaxies, usually referred to as post-starburst galaxies, span a wide range of colors and we find a clear correlation between color and half-light radius, such that bluer galaxies are smaller. We build simple toy models to explain this correlation: a normal star-forming disk plus a central, compact starburst component. Bursts with exponential decay timescale of \${\textbackslash}sim\${\textasciitilde}100 Myr that produce \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textbackslash}\%\$ to more than 100{\textbackslash}\% of the pre-existing masses can reproduce the observed correlation. More significant bursts also produce bluer and smaller descendants. Our findings imply that when galaxies shut down star formation rapidly, they generally had experienced compact, starburst events and that the large, observed spread in sizes and colors mostly reflects a variety of burst strengths. Recently quenched galaxies should have younger stellar ages in the centers; multi-wavelength data with high spatial resolution are required to reveal the age gradient. Highly dissipative processes should be responsible for this type of formation history. While determining the mechanisms for individual galaxies is challenging, some recently quenched galaxies show signs of gravitational interactions, suggesting that mergers are likely an important mechanism in triggering the rapid shut-down of star-formation activities at \$z{\textbackslash}sim0.8\$.},

For both bulge-types, their Eddington ratios are correlated with specific star formation rates ({SSFR}).

We find that \$5-40{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the outer (\$50-300\$ kpc) stellar halo in each system consists of \${\textbackslash}textit\{in-situ\}\$ stars that were born in outflows from the main galaxy. Outflow stars originate from gas accelerated by super-bubble winds, which can be compressed, cool, and form co-moving stars. The majority of these stars remain bound to the halo and fall back with orbital properties similar to the rest of the stellar halo at \$z=0\$.In the outer halo, outflow stars are more spatially homogeneous, metal rich, and alpha-element-enhanced than the accreted stellar halo. At the solar location, up to \${\textbackslash}sim 10 {\textbackslash}\%\$ of our kinematically-identified halo stars were born in outflows; the fraction rises to as high as \${\textbackslash}sim 40{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the most metal-rich local halo stars ([Fe/H] \${\textgreater} -0.5\$). We conclude that the Milky Way stellar halo could contain local counterparts to stars that are observed to form in molecular outflows in distant galaxies.

The sample includes 256 spectroscopic members across all five {dSphs}. We confirm previous measurements of the velocity dispersions and dynamical masses, and we provide upper limits on bulk rotation. Our measurements confirm that M31 satellites obey the same relation between stellar mass and stellar metallicity as Milky Way ({MW}) satellites and other dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. The metallicity distributions show similar trends with stellar mass as {MW} satellites, including evidence in massive satellites for external influence, like pre-enrichment or gas accretion. We present the first measurements of individual element ratios, like [Si/Fe], in the M31 system, as well as measurements of the average [alpha/Fe] ratio. The trends of [alpha/Fe] with [Fe/H] also follow the same galaxy mass-dependent patterns as {MW} satellites. Less massive galaxies have more steeply declining slopes of [alpha/Fe] that begin at lower [Fe/H]. Finally, we compare the chemical evolution of M31 satellites to M31's Giant Stellar Stream and smooth halo. The properties of the M31 system support the theoretical prediction that the inner halo is composed primarily of massive galaxies that were accreted early. As a result, the inner halo exhibits higher [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] than surviving satellite galaxies.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14235},
	abstract = {Feedback is indispensable in galaxy formation. However, cosmological simulations often use {\textbackslash}textit\{ad hoc\} feedback recipes due to a lack of resolution. Conversely, small-box simulations, while better resolving the feedback process, cannot capture gas evolution beyond the simulation domain. We aim to bridge the gap by implementing small-box results of {SNe}-driven outflows into a Mpc simulation and studying their impact on large scales. Small-box simulations show that the outflows are multiphase, but the hot phase (T\${\textbackslash}approx\$ 10\${\textasciicircum}\{6-7\}\$ K) carries the majority of energy and metals. We implement the hot outflows at the base of a Milky Way-mass galaxy, and examine how they impact the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}). In this paper, we discuss the case when the hot outflows are gravitationally bound by the dark matter halo. We find that outflows form a large-scale, metal-enriched atmosphere with fountain motions. As more hot gas accumulates, the inner atmosphere becomes "saturated". Cool clumps condense and fall toward the galaxy; the rate of condensation balances the injection of the hot outflows. This balance leads to a universal density profile of the hot atmosphere, independent of the outflow mass flux. The atmosphere has a radially-decreasing temperature, which naturally produces the observed X-ray luminosity and column densities of O {VI}, O {VII}, O {VIII} of the {CGM} around Milky Way-like galaxies. The self-regulated atmosphere has a baryon and a metal mass of \$(0.5-1.2){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and \$(0.6-1.4){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, respectively, small compared to the "missing" baryons and metals from the halo.

We find that previously observed relationships between obscuration and Eddington ratio or stellar mass are not sufficient reproduce the observed quasar clustering results (\${\textbackslash}langle {\textbackslash}log M\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{halo\}\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textbackslash}rangle = 12.94 {\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.10\}\_\{- 0.11\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}langle {\textbackslash}log M\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{halo\}\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textbackslash}rangle = 12.49 {\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.08\}\_\{- 0.08\}\$ for obscured and unobscured populations, respectively) while maintaining the observed fraction of obscured quasars (30-65\${\textbackslash}\%\$). This work suggests that evolutionary models, in which obscuration evolves on the typical timescale for black hole growth, are necessary to understand the observed clustering of mid-{IR} selected quasars.},

We use the E-{MOSAICS} cosmological simulations of {\textasciitilde}L* galaxies and their {GCs} to investigate the [\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution of field stars and {GCs} in 25 Milky Way-mass galaxies. The [\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution go {GCs} largely follows that of the field stars and can also therefore be used as tracers of the [\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}/Fe]-[Fe/H] evolution of the galaxy. Due to the difference in their star formation histories, {GCs} associated with stellar streams (i.e. which have recently been accreted) have systematically lower [\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}/Fe] at fixed [Fe/H]. Therefore, if a {GC} is observed to have low [\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}/Fe] for its [Fe/H] there is an increased probability that this {GC} was accreted recently alongside a dwarf galaxy. There is a wide range of shapes for the field star [\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution, with a notable subset of galaxies exhibiting bimodal distributions, in which the high [\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}/Fe] sequence is mostly comprised of stars in the bulge, a high fraction of which are from disrupted {GCs}. We calculate the contribution of disrupted {GCs} to the bulge component of the 25 simulated galaxies and find values between 0.3-14 per cent, where this fraction correlates with the galaxy's formation time. The upper range of these fractions is compatible with observationally-inferred measurements for the Milky Way, suggesting that in this respect the Milky Way is not typical of L* galaxies, having experienced a phase of unusually rapid growth at early times.},

	abstract = {Using a 1D Lagrangian code specifically designed to assess the impact of multiple, time-resolved supernovae ({SNe}) from a single star cluster on the surrounding medium, we test three commonly used feedback recipes: delayed cooling (e.g., used in the {GASOLINE}-2 code), momentum-energy injection (a resolution-dependent transition between momentum-dominated feedback and energy-dominated feedback used, e.g., in the {FIRE}-2 code), and simultaneous energy injection (e.g., used in the {EAGLE} simulations). Our work provides an intermediary test for these recipes: we analyse a setting that is more complex than the simplified scenarios for which many were designed, but one more controlled than a full galactic simulation. In particular, we test how well these models reproduce the enhanced momentum efficiency seen for an 11 {SN} cluster simulated at high resolution (0.6 pc; a factor of 12 enhancement relative to the isolated {SN} case) when these subgrid recipes are implemented in low resolution (20 pc) runs. We find that: 1) the delayed cooling model performs well -- resulting in 9 times the momentum efficiency of the fiducial isolated {SN} value -- when {SNe} are clustered and \$10{\textasciicircum}\{51\}\$ erg are injected per {SN}, while clearly over-predicting the momentum efficiency in the single {SN} test case; 2) the momentum-energy model always achieves good results, with a factor of 5 boost in momentum efficiency; and 3) injecting the energy from all {SNe} simultaneously does little to prevent over-cooling and greatly under-produces the momentum deposited by clustered {SNe}, resulting in a factor of 3 decrease in momentum efficiency on the average.},

We find a trend for r31 to increase with star-formation efficiency ({SFE}). We model r31 using the {UCL}-{PDR} code and find that the gas density is the main parameter responsible for variation of r31, while the interstellar radiation field and cosmic ray ionization rate play only a minor role. We interpret these results to indicate a relation between {SFE} and gas density. We do not find a difference in the r31 value of {SFGs} and {AGN} host galaxies, when the galaxies are matched in {SSFR} ({\textless}r31{\textgreater}= 0.52 +/- 0.04 for {SFGs} and {\textless}r31{\textgreater} = 0.53 +/- 0.06 for {AGN} hosts). According to the results of {UCL}-{PDR} models, the X-rays can contribute to the enhancement of the {CO} line ratio, but only for strong X-ray fluxes and for high gas density ({nH} {\textgreater} 10\${\textasciicircum}4\$ cm-3). We find a mild tightening of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation when we use the molecular gas mass surface density traced by {CO}(3-2) (Pearson correlation coefficient R=0.83), instead of the molecular gas mass surface density traced by {CO}(1-0) (R=0.78), but the increase in correlation is not statistically significant (p-value=0.06). This suggests that the {CO}(3-2) line can be reliably used to study the relation between {SFR} and molecular gas for normal {SFGs} at high redshift, and to compare it with studies of low-redshift galaxies, as is common practice.},

	abstract = {Aims. Our aim is to estimate the intergalactic medium transmission towards {UV}-selected star-forming galaxies at redshift 4 and above and study the effect of the dust attenuation on these measurements. Methods. The ultra-violet spectrum of high redshift galaxies is a combination of their intrinsic emission and the effect of the Inter-Galactic medium ({IGM}) absorption along their line of sight. Using data coming from the unprecedented deep spectroscopy from the {VANDELS} {ESO} public survey carried out with the {VIMOS} instrument we compute both the dust extinction and the mean transmission of the {IGM} as well as its scatter from a set of 281 galaxies at z{\textgreater}3.87. Because of a degeneracy between the dust content of the galaxy and the {IGM}, we first estimate the stellar dust extinction parameter E(B-V) and study the result as a function of the dust prescription. Using these measurements as constraint for the spectral fit we estimate the {IGM} transmission Tr(Lyalpha). Both photometric and spectroscopic {SED} fitting are done using the {SPectroscopy} And {photometRy} {fiTting} tool for Astronomical {aNalysis} ({SPARTAN}) that is able to fit the spectral continuum of the galaxies as well as photometric data. Results. Using the classical Calzetti's attenuation law we find that E(B-V) goes from 0.11 at z=3.99 to 0.08 at z=5.15. These results are in very good agreement with previous measurements from the literature. We estimate the {IGM} transmission and find that the transmission is decreasing with increasing redshift from Tr(Lyalpha)=0.53 at z=3.99 to 0.28 at z=5.15. We also find a large standard deviation around the average transmission that is more than 0.1 at every redshift. Our results are in very good agreement with both previous measurements from {AGN} studies and with theoretical models.},

The total gas and stellar mass of {FABLE} clusters are in very good agreement with observations and show negligible redshift evolution at fixed halo mass for \$M\_\{500\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at \$z {\textbackslash}lesssim 1\$, in line with recent findings from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ({SZ})-selected cluster samples. Importantly, the simulations predict significant redshift evolution in these quantities in the low mass (\$M\_\{500\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) regime, which will be testable with upcoming {SZ} surveys such as {SPT}-3G. While the stellar masses of {FABLE} {BCGs} are in reasonable agreement with observations, the total stellar mass in satellite galaxies is lower than observed and the total mass in {ICL} is somewhat higher. This may be caused by enhanced tidal stripping of satellite galaxies due to their large sizes. {BCGs} are characterised by moderate stellar mass growth at \$z {\textless} 1\$ coincident with a late-time development of the {ICL}. The level of {BCG} mass growth is in good agreement with recent observations, however, we caution that the inferred growth depends sensitively on the mass definition. We further show that in-situ star formation contributes more than half the mass of a {BCG} over its lifetime, the bulk of which is gained at \$z {\textgreater} 1\$ where star formation rates are highest. The stellar mass profiles of the {BCG}+{ICL} component are similar to observed profiles out to \${\textbackslash}sim 100\$ kpc at \$z {\textbackslash}approx 0\$ and follow a close to power law shape out to several hundred kpc. We further demonstrate that the inferred size growth of {BCGs} can be severely biased by the choice of parametric model and the outer radius of the fit.},

	abstract = {We present a statistical analysis of flybys of dark matter halos compared to mergers using cosmological \$N\$-body simulations. We mainly focus on gravitationally interacting target halos with mass of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10.8\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{13.0\}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, and their neighbors are counted only when the mass ratio is 1:3\$-\$3:1 and the distance is less than the sum of the virial radii of target and neighbor. The neighbors are divided into the flyby or merger samples if the pair's total energy is greater or smaller, respectively, than the capture criterion with consideration of dynamical friction. The main results are as follows: (a) The flyby fraction increases by up to a factor of 50 with decreasing halo mass and by up to a factor of 400 with increasing large-scale density, while the merger fraction does not show any significant dependencies on these two parameters; (b) The redshift evolution of the flyby fraction is twofold, increasing with redshift at \$0{\textless}z{\textless}1\$ and remaining constant at \$z{\textgreater}1\$, while the merger fraction increases monotonically with redshift at \$z=0{\textbackslash}sim4\$; (c) The multiple interactions with two or more neighbors are on average flyby-dominated, and their fraction has a mass and environment dependence similar to that for the flyby fraction; (d) Given that flybys substantially outnumber mergers toward \$z=0\$ (by a factor of five) and the multiple interactions are flyby-dominated, the flyby's contribution to galactic evolution is stronger than ever at the present epoch, especially for less massive halos and in the higher density environment. We propose a scenario that connects the evolution of the flyby and merger fractions to the hierarchical structure formation process.},

We use a combination of correlation statistics and an artificial neural network to quantify the parameters that drive both the absolute star formation rate surface density (Sigma\_SFR), as well as its scatter around the resolved star forming main sequence (Delta Sigma\_SFR). We find that Sigma\_SFR is primarily regulated by molecular gas surface density (Sigma\_H2) with a secondary dependence on stellar mass surface density (Sigma\_*), as expected from an `extended Kennicutt-Schmidt relation'. However, Delta Sigma\_SFR is driven primarily by changes in star formation efficiency ({SFE}), with variations in gas fraction playing a secondary role. Taken together, our results demonstrate that whilst the absolute rate of star formation is primarily set by the amount of molecular gas, the variation of star formation rate above and below the resolved star forming main sequence (on kpc scales) is primarily due to changes in {SFE}.},

	abstract = {We revisit the orbital history of the Triangulum galaxy (M33) around the Andromeda galaxy (M31) in view of the recent Gaia Data Release 2 proper motion measurements for both Local Group galaxies. Earlier studies consider highly idealized dynamical friction, but neglect the effects of dynamical mass loss. We show the latter process to be important using orbit integrations and N-body simulations, which are mutually consistent. Contrary to previous claims that only a `first infall' is supported by the data, we find an orbital solution that brings these galaxies to within {\textasciitilde}50 kpc of each other in the past, i.e. {\textasciitilde}6.5 Gyr ago. We explore the implications of this finding using a N-body/hydrodynamical simulation to model the infall of M33 into M31 with a focus on the origin of two prominent features of this system: 1) M31's metal-rich Giant Stellar Stream; and 2) the M31-M33 {HI} filament. We find that the tidal interaction does not produce a stellar structure reminiscent of the stellar stream that survives up to the present day. The observed, outer disc warp in M33 may well be a relic of this past interaction. Similarly, the {HI} filament is likely a fossil structure dating back to the time of the ancient encounter between these galaxies. Our model implies the existence of a much larger, diffuse gas stream, the `Triangulum stream', that extends from M33 away from M31. We anticipate upcoming observations with the recently commissioned, Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope ({FAST}) that will target the putative stream in its first years of operation.},

The ionized gas emission extends far beyond the central stellar component of the galaxy, reaching similar distances to that of the diffuse neutral halo traced by 21 cm observations. H-alpha emission extends several degrees beyond the sensitivity of current H I surveys toward smaller Galactic longitudes and more negative Galactic latitudes. The velocity field of the ionized gas near the {SMC} appears similar to to the neutral halo of the galaxy. Using the observed emission measure as a guide, we estimate the mass of this newly revealed ionized component to be roughly (0.8 - 1.0) x 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_sun, which is comparable to the total neutral mass in the same region of (0.9 - 1.1) x 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_sun.

	abstract = {The circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) is one of the frontiers of galaxy formation and intimately connected to the galaxy via accretion of gas on to the galaxy and gaseous outflows from the galaxy. Here we analyse the magnetic field in the {CGM} of the Milky Way-like galaxies simulated as part of the {\textbackslash}textsc\{Auriga\} project that constitutes a set of high resolution cosmological magnetohydrodynamical zoom simulations. We show that at high redshift the {CGM} becomes magnetised via galactic outflows that transport magnetised gas from the disk into the halo. At this time the magnetisation of the {CGM} closely follows its metal enrichment. We then show that at low redshift an in-situ turbulent dynamo that operates on a timescale of Gigayears further amplifies the magnetic field in the {CGM} and sets its strength down \$z=0\$. The magnetic field strength reaches a typical value of \$0.1{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu G\$ at the virial radius at \$z=0\$ and becomes mostly uniform within the virial radius. Its Faraday rotation signal is in excellent agreement with recent observations. For most of its evolution the magnetic field in the {CGM} is an unordered small scale field. Only strong coherent outflows at low redshift are able to order the magnetic field in parts of the {CGM} that are directly displaced by these outflows.},

	abstract = {Hot gaseous atmospheres that permeate galaxies and extend far beyond their stellar distribution, where they are commonly referred to as the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}), imprint important information about feedback processes powered by the stellar populations of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes ({SMBH}). In this work we study the properties of this hot X-ray emitting medium using the {IllustrisTNG} cosmological simulations. We analyse their mock X-ray spectra, obtained in {TNG}100 and {TNG}50, and compare the results with X-ray observations of nearby early-type galaxies. The simulations reproduce the observed X-ray luminosities (\$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}\$) and temperature (\$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\})\$ at small (\${\textless}R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}\$) and intermediate (\${\textless}5R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}\$) radii reasonably well. We find that the X-ray properties of lower mass galaxies depend on their star formation rates. In particular, in the magnitude range where the star-forming and quenched populations overlap, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}{\textbackslash}sim-24\$ \$ (M\_*{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{10.7\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot)\$, we find that the X-ray luminosities of star-forming galaxies are on average about an order of magnitude higher than those of their quenched counterparts. We show that this diversity in \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}\$ is a direct manifestation of the quenching mechanism in the simulations, where the galaxies are quenched due to gas expulsion driven by {SMBH} kinetic feedback. The observed dichotomy in \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}\$ is thus an important observable prediction for the {SMBH} feedback-based quenching mechanisms implemented in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. While the current X-ray observations of star forming galaxies are broadly consistent with the predictions of the simulations, the observed samples are small and more decisive tests are expected from the sensitive all-sky X-ray survey with {eROSITA}.},

The introduction of the cold gas kinematics shows a significant effect on the confidence limits of especially the dark halo properties: we exclude more than \$95{\textbackslash}\%\$ of models within the \$1-{\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence level of Schwarzschild modelling with only stellar kinematics, and reduce the relative uncertainty of the dark matter fraction significantly to \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$ within \$5 R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{e\}\$.

We cannot constrain the inner slope with the stellar kinematics alone.},

	abstract = {We present the pilot study component of the Fluorescent Lyman-Alpha Structures in High-z Environments ({FLASHES}) Survey; the largest integral-field spectroscopy survey to date of the circumgalactic medium at \$z=2.3-3.1\$. We observed 48 quasar fields between 2015 and 2018 with the Palomar Cosmic Web Imager (Matuszewski et al. 2010). Extended {HI} Lyman-\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ emission is discovered around 42/48 of the observed quasars, ranging in projected, flux-weighted radius from 21-71 proper kiloparsecs (pkpc), with 26 nebulae exceeding \$100{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textasciitilde}pkpc\}\$ in effective diameter. The circularly averaged surface brightness radial profile peaks at a maximum of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{1{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-17\}{\textasciitilde}erg{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textasciitilde}cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}{\textasciitilde}arcsec{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\}\$ (\$2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textasciitilde}cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}{\textasciitilde}arcsec{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\}\$ adjusted for cosmological dimming) and luminosities range from \$1.9{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{43\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ to \$-14.1{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{43\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$. The emission appears to have a highly eccentric morphology and a maximum covering factor of \$50{\textbackslash}\%\$ (\$60{\textbackslash}\%\$ for giant nebulae). On average, the nebular spectra are red-shifted with respect to both the systemic redshift and Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ peak of the quasar spectrum. The integrated spectra of the nebulae mostly have single or double-peaked line shapes with global dispersions ranging from \$167{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ to \$690{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$, though the individual (Gaussian) components of lines with complex shapes mostly appear to have dispersions \${\textbackslash}leq 400\$ \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$, and the flux-weighted velocity centroids of the lines vary by thousands of \$ {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ with respect to the systemic {QSO} redshifts. Finally, the root-mean-square velocities of the nebulae are found to be consistent with (i.e., not exceeding) gravitational motions expected in host dark matter halos of {QSOs} at this redshift. We compare these results to existing surveys at both higher and lower redshift.},

	abstract = {Starburst galaxies are efficient \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray producers, because their high supernova rates generate copious cosmic ray ({CR}) protons, and their high gas densities act as thick targets off which these protons can produce neutral pions and thence \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-rays. In this paper we present a first-principles calculation of the mechanisms by which {CRs} propagate through such environments, combining astrochemical models with analysis of turbulence in weakly ionised plasma. We show that {CRs} cannot scatter off the strong large-scale turbulence found in starbursts, because efficient ion-neutral damping prevents such turbulence from cascading down to the scales of {CR} gyroradii. Instead, {CRs} stream along field lines at a rate determined by the competition between streaming instability and ion-neutral damping, leading to transport via a process of field line random walk. This results in an effective diffusion coefficient that is nearly energy-independent up to {CR} energies of \${\textbackslash}sim 1\$ {TeV}. We apply our computed diffusion coefficient to a simple model of {CR} escape and loss, and show that the resulting \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray spectra are in good agreement with the observed spectra of the starbursts {NGC} 253, M82, and Arp 220. In particular, our model reproduces these galaxies' relatively hard {GeV} \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray spectra and softer {TeV} spectra without the need for any fine-tuning of advective escape times or the shape of the {CR} injection spectrum.},

	abstract = {We provide an analytic framework for interpreting observations of multiphase circumgalactic gas that is heavily informed by recent numerical simulations of thermal instability and precipitation in cool-core galaxy clusters. We start by considering the local conditions required for the formation of multiphase gas via two different modes: (1) uplift of ambient gas by galactic outflows, and (2) condensation in a stratified stationary medium in which thermal balance is explicitly maintained. Analytic exploration of these two modes provides insights into the relationships between the local ratio of the cooling and freefall time scales (i.e., t\_cool / t\_ff), the large-scale gradient of specific entropy, and development of precipitation and multiphase media in circumgalactic gas. We then use these analytic findings to interpret recent simulations of circumgalactic gas in which global thermal balance is maintained. We show that long-lasting configurations of gas with 5 {\textless} t\_cool / t\_ff {\textless} 20 and radial entropy profiles similar to observations of local cool-core galaxy cluster cores are a natural outcome of precipitation-regulated feedback. We conclude with some observational predictions that follow from these models. This work focuses primarily on precipitation and {AGN} feedback in galaxy cluster cores, because that is where the observations of multiphase gas around galaxies are most complete. However, many of the physical principles that govern condensation in those environments apply to circumgalactic gas around galaxies of all masses.},

The simulation includes a blastwave scheme for supernova feedback, a star-formation recipe based on a high gas density threshold, metal-dependent radiative cooling, a scheme for the turbulent diffusion of metals and thermal energy, and a uniform {UV} background. The properties of the simulated dwarfs are strongly modulated by the depth of the gravitational potential well. All three halos with M vir {\textless} 10 9 M⊙ are devoid of stars, as they never reach the density threshold for star formation of 100 atoms cm-3. The other four, M vir {\textgreater} 109 M⊙ dwarfs have blue colors, low star-formation efficiencies, high cold gas-to-stellar mass ratios, and low stellar metallicities. Their bursty star-formation histories are characterized by peak specific star-formation rates in excess of 50-100 Gyr -1, far outside the realm of normal, more massive galaxies. The median stellar age of the simulated galaxies decreases with decreasing halo mass, with the two M vir ≃ 2-3 × 109 M ⊙ dwarfs being predominantly young, and the two more massive systems hosting intermediate and older populations. The cosmologically young dwarfs are lit up by tidal interactions, have compact morphologies, and have metallicities and cold gas fractions similar to the relatively quiescent, extremely metal-deficient dwarf population. Metal-enriched galactic outflows produce sub-solar effective yields and pollute with heavy elements a megaparsec-size region of the intergalactic medium, but are not sufficient to completely quench star-formation activity and are absent in the faintest dwarfs. © 2014.

We estimate star formation rate surface densities (\${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$) via dust corrected \$H{\textbackslash}alpha\$ flux where possible, and via an empirical relationship between specific star formation rate ({sSFR}) and the strength of the 4000 Angstrom break (D4000) in all other cases. We train a multi-layered artificial neural network ({ANN}) and a random forest ({RF}) to classify spaxels into `star forming' and `quenched' categories given various individual (and groups of) parameters. We find that global parameters (pertaining to the galaxy as a whole) perform collectively the best at predicting when spaxels will be quenched, and are substantially superior to local/ spatially resolved and environmental parameters. Central velocity dispersion is the best single parameter for predicting quenching in central galaxies. We interpret this observational fact as a probable consequence of the total integrated energy from {AGN} feedback being traced by the mass of the black hole, which is well known to correlate strongly with central velocity dispersion. Additionally, we train both an {ANN} and {RF} to estimate \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$ values directly via regression in star forming regions. Local/ spatially resolved parameters are collectively the most predictive at estimating \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$ in these analyses, with stellar mass surface density at the spaxel location (\${\textbackslash}Sigma\_*\$) being by far the best single parameter. Thus, quenching is fundamentally a global process but star formation is governed locally by processes within each spaxel.},

	abstract = {The discovery of quasars few hundred megayears after the Big Bang represents a major challenge to our understanding of black holes and galaxy formation and evolution. Their luminosity is produced by extreme gas accretion onto black holes, which already reached masses of 10\${\textasciicircum}9\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ by z {\textasciitilde} 6. Simultaneously, their host galaxies form hundreds of stars per year, using up gas in the process. To understand which environments are able to sustain the rapid formation of these extreme sources we started a {VLT}/{MUSE} effort aimed at characterizing the surroundings of a sample of 5.7 {\textless} z {\textless} 6.6 quasars dubbed: the Reionization Epoch {QUasar} {InvEstigation} with {MUSE} ({REQUIEM}) survey. We here present results of our searches for extended Ly-Alpha halos around the first 31 targets observed as part of this program. Reaching 5-sigma surface brightness limits of 0.1-1.1 x 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-17\}\$ erg/s/cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$/arcsec\${\textasciicircum}2\$ over a 1 arcsec\${\textasciicircum}2\$ aperture, we were able to unveil the presence of 12 Ly-Alpha nebulae, 8 of which are newly discovered. The detected nebulae show a variety of emission properties and morphologies with luminosities ranging from 8 x 10\${\textasciicircum}\{42\}\$ to 2 x 10\${\textasciicircum}\{44\}\$ erg/s, {FWHMs} between 300 and 1700 km/s, sizes {\textless} 30 pkpc, and redshifts consistent with those of the quasar host galaxies. As the first statistical and homogeneous investigation of the circum-galactic medium of massive galaxies at the end of the reionization epoch, the {REQUIEM} survey enables the study of the evolution of the cool gas surrounding quasars in the first 3 Gyr of the Universe. A comparison with the extended Ly-Alpha emission observed around bright (M\$\_\{1450\}\$ {\textless} -25 mag) quasars at intermediate redshift indicates little variations on the properties of the cool gas from z {\textasciitilde} 6 to z {\textasciitilde} 3 followed by a decline in the average surface brightness down to z {\textasciitilde} 2.},

By increasing the spatial resolution alone, the total luminosity of the line emission increases by an order of magnitude. This increase arises in the abundance of dense small-scale structure resolved when the {CGM} gas is simulated to {\textless} 100 pc scales. Current integral field unit instruments like {KCWI} and {MUSE} should be able to detect the brightest knots and filaments of such emission, and from this to infer the bulk kinematics of the {CGM} gas with respect to the galaxy.

The total mass and energetics of the outflow, which includes contributions from the ionized, neutral, warm and cold molecular gas phases is strongly dominated by the cold molecular gas. In fact, the molecular mass outflow rate is higher than the star formation rate, even if we only consider the gas in the outflow that is fast enough to escape the galaxy, which accounts for about \${\textbackslash}sim\$40\% of the total mass of the outflow.

	abstract = {Supermassive black holes ({SMBHs}) are thought to provide energy that prevents catastrophic cooling in the centers of massive galaxies and galaxy clusters. However, it remains unclear how this "feedback" process operates. We use high-resolution optical data to study the kinematics of multi-phase filamentary structures by measuring the velocity structure function ({VSF}) of the filaments over a wide range of scales in the centers of three nearby galaxy clusters: Perseus, Abell 2597 and Virgo. We find that the motions of the filaments are turbulent in all three clusters studied. There is a clear correlation between features of the {VSFs} and the sizes of bubbles inflated by {SMBH} driven jets. Our study demonstrates that {SMBHs} are the main driver of turbulent gas motions in the centers of galaxy clusters and suggests that this turbulence is an important channel for coupling feedback to the environment. Our measured amplitude of turbulence is in good agreement with Hitomi Doppler line broadening measurement and X-ray surface brightness fluctuation analysis, suggesting that the motion of the cold filaments is well-coupled to that of the hot gas. The smallest scales we probe are comparable to the mean free path in the intracluster medium ({ICM}). Our direct detection of turbulence on these scales provides the clearest evidence to date that isotropic viscosity is suppressed in the weakly-collisional, magnetized intracluster plasma.},

These unique sightlines allow us to study the quasar circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) in absorption and emission simultaneously, because the background quasar pinpoints large concentrations of gas where Lyα emission, resulting from quasar-powered fluorescence, resonant Lyα scattering, and/or cooling radiation, is expected. A sensitive search (1σ surface-brightness limits of ) for diffuse Lyα emission in the environments of the foreground (predominantly radio-quiet) quasars is conducted using Gemini/{GMOS} and Keck/{LRIS} slit spectroscopy. We fail to detect large-scale 100 kpc Lyα emission, either at the location of the optically thick absorbers or in the foreground quasar halos, in all cases except a single system. We interpret these non-detections as evidence that the gas detected in absorption is shadowed from the quasar {UV} radiation due to obscuration effects, which are frequently invoked in unified models of active galactic nuclei. Small-scale R ≲ 50 kpc extended Lyα nebulosities are detected in 34\% of our sample, which are likely the high-redshift analogs of the extended emission-line regions ({EELRs}) commonly observed around low-redshift (z {\textless} 0.5) quasars. This may be fluorescent recombination radiation from a population of very dense clouds with a low covering fraction illuminated by the quasar. We also detect a compact high rest-frame equivalent width (W Lyα {\textgreater} 50 Å) Lyα-emitter with luminosity L Lyα = 2.1 ± 0.32 × 1041 erg s -1 at small impact parameter R = 134 kpc from one foreground quasar, and argue that it is more likely to result from quasar-powered fluorescence, than simply be a star-forming galaxy clustered around the quasar. Our observations imply that much deeper integrations with upcoming integral-field spectrometers such as {MUSE} and {KCWI} will be able to routinely detect a diffuse Lyα glow around bright quasars on scales R 100 kpc and thus directly image the {CGM}. © 2013.

We additionally report on the gas mass that becomes unbound from the {LMC} disk and swept by ram pressure into the Trailing Magellanic Stream. We find that, even for our largest outburst, the mass contribution to the Stream is still quite small, as much of the {LMC} halo gas is shielded on the {LMC}'s far-side due to the {LMC}'s primarily face-on infall through the Milky Way halo over the past Gyr. On the {LMC}'s near-side, past outflows have fought an uphill battle against ram pressure, with near-side halo mass being at least a factor of a few smaller than the far-side. Absorption line studies probing only the {LMC} foreground, then, may be severely underestimating the total mass of the {LMC} halo formed by outflows. {LMC}-{SMC} tidal stripping, not modeled in our simulations, may be able to further expel this outflow gas into a trailing filament, however.},

	abstract = {We study specific star formation rate ({sSFR}) and gas profiles of star forming and green valley galaxies in the {\textbackslash}simba{\textbackslash} cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. Star-forming galaxy half-light radii (\$R\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{half\}\}\$) at \$z=0\$ agree well with observations, but its evolution \${\textbackslash}propto(1+z){\textasciicircum}\{-1.1\}\$ is somewhat too rapid. We compare {\textbackslash}simba{\textbackslash} \$z=0\$ {sSFR} radial profiles for main sequence and green valley galaxies to observations {\textbackslash}citep\{belfiore\_2018\}. {\textbackslash}simba{\textbackslash} shows strong central depressions in star formation rate ({SFR}), specific {SFR}, and gas fraction in green valley galaxies and massive star-forming systems, qualitatively as observed. This owes primarily to black hole X-ray feedback, which pushes dense central gas outwards; turning off X-ray feedback leads to centrally peaked {sSFR} profiles as found in other simulations. In conflict with observations, {\textbackslash}simba{\textbackslash} yields green valley galaxies with strongly dropping {SFR} profiles beyond \${\textbackslash}gtrsim R\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{half\}\}\$, regardless of {AGN} feedback. The central depression owes to lowering the molecular gas content, while the drop in the outskirts owes to a reduced star formation efficiency. {\textbackslash}simba's satellites have higher central {sSFR} and lower outskirts {sSFR} than centrals, in qualitative agreement with observations. At \$z=2\$ {\textbackslash}simba{\textbackslash} does not show strong central depressions in massive star-forming galaxies, whereas observations do, suggesting that {\textbackslash}simba's X-ray feedback should be more active at high-\$z\$. Reproducing the central {sSFR} depression in \$z=0\$ green valley galaxies represents a unique success of {\textbackslash}simba, but the remaining discrepancies highlight the importance of {SFR} and gas profiles in constraining the physical mechanisms by which galaxies quench.},

	abstract = {We investigate the impact of cosmic rays ({CR}) and different modes of {CR} transport on the properties of Milky Way-like galaxies in cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations in the context of the {AURIGA} project. We systematically study how advection, anisotropic diffusion and additional Alfv{\textbackslash}'en-wave cooling affect the galactic disk and the circum-galactic medium ({CGM}). Global properties such as stellar mass and star formation rate vary little between simulations with and without various {CR} transport physics, whereas structural properties such as disk sizes, {CGM} densities or temperatures can be strongly affected. In our simulations, {CRs} affect the accretion of gas onto galaxies by modifying the {CGM} flow structure. This alters the angular momentum distribution which manifests itself as a difference in stellar and gaseous disk size. The strength of this effect depends on the {CR} transport model: {CR} advection results in the most compact disks while the Alfv{\textbackslash}'en-wave model resembles more the {AURIGA} model. The advection and diffusion models exhibit large (\$r{\textbackslash}sim50\$ kpc) {CR} pressure-dominated gas haloes causing a smoother and partly cooler {CGM}. The additional {CR} pressure smoothes small-scale density peaks and compensates for the missing thermal pressure support at lower {CGM} temperatures. In contrast, the Alfv{\textbackslash}'en-wave model is only {CR} pressure dominated at the disk-halo interface and only in this model the gamma-ray emission from hadronic interactions agrees with observations. In contrast to previous findings, we conclude that details of {CR} transport are critical for accurately predicting the impact of {CR} feedback on galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {We study the spatially resolved (sub-kpc) gas velocity dispersion (\${\textbackslash}sigma\$)--star formation rate ({SFR}) relation in the {FIRE}-2 (Feedback in Realistic Environments) cosmological simulations. We specifically focus on Milky Way mass disk galaxies at late times. In agreement with observations, we find a relatively flat relationship, with \${\textbackslash}sigma {\textbackslash}approx 15-30\$ km/s in neutral gas across 3 dex in {SFRs}. We show that higher dense gas fractions (ratios of dense gas to neutral gas) and {SFRs} are correlated at constant \${\textbackslash}sigma\$. Similarly, lower gas fractions (ratios of gas to stellar mass) are correlated with higher \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ at constant {SFR}. The limits of the \${\textbackslash}sigma\$-\${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$ relation correspond to the onset of strong outflows. We see evidence of "on-off" cycles of star formation in the simulations, corresponding to feedback injection timescales of 10-100 Myr, where {SFRs} oscillate about equilibrium {SFR} predictions. Finally, {SFRs} and velocity dispersions in the simulations agree well with feedback-regulated and marginally stable gas disk (Toomre's \$Q =1\$) model predictions, and the data effectively rule out models assuming that gas turns into stars at (low) constant efficiency (i.e., \$\{{\textbackslash}rm 1{\textbackslash}\%\}\$ per free-fall time). And although the simulation data do not entirely exclude gas accretion/gravitationally powered turbulence as a driver of \${\textbackslash}sigma\$, it appears to be strongly subdominant to stellar feedback in the simulated galaxy disks.},

We test a variety of spectral models which yields a best-fit consisting of an absorbed power law with emission and absorption features in the Fe K band. Remarkably, we find evidence for a blueshifted Fe K absorption feature at \$E\$ = 7.8 {keV} (rest-frame) which implies an ultra-fast outflow ({UFO}) with \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{out\}\} = 0.11{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}pm{\textbackslash} 0.01c\$.

Comparing the energetics of the {UFO} to the observed multi-phase outflows at kiloparsec scales yields an efficiency factor of \$f{\textbackslash}sim0.05\$ for an energy-driven outflow. Given the uncertainties, however, we cannot exclude the possibility of a momentum-driven outflow. Comparing {IRAS} F05189-2524 with nine other objects with observed {UFOs} and large-scale galactic outflows suggests that there is a range of efficiency factors for the coupling of the energetics of the nuclear and galaxy-scale outflows that likely depend on specific physical conditions in each object.},

In this paper, we study the galaxy population around a very metal poor gas cloud at z{\textasciitilde}3.5 towards the quasar J124957.23-015928.8. We detect three Lyman alpha emitters within {\textless}200km/s of the cloud redshift, at projected separations {\textless}185 kpc (physical). The presence of star-forming galaxies near a very metal-poor cloud indicates that metal enrichment is still spatially inhomogeneous at this redshift. Based on its very low metallicity and the presence of nearby galaxies, we propose that the most likely scenario for this {LLS} is that it lies within a filament which may be accreting onto a nearby galaxy. Taken together with the small number of other {LLSs} studied with {MUSE}, the observations to date show a range of different environments near strong absorption systems.

In particular, the role of black hole feedback in regulating star formation, a key process in our theoretical understanding of galaxy formation, remains highly debated. We present here observational evidence showing that, at fixed stellar velocity dispersion, the temperature of the hot gas is higher for those galaxies hosting more massive black holes in their centers. Analyzed in the context of well-established scaling relations, particularly the mass-size plane, the relation between the mass of the black hole and the temperature of the hot gas around massive galaxies provides further observational support to the idea that baryonic processes within massive galaxies are regulated by the combined effects of the galaxy halo virial temperature and black hole feedback, in agreement with the expectations from the {EAGLE} cosmological numerical simulation.},

	abstract = {We investigate models of self-consistent chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium ({IGM}) from z = 6.0 → 1.5, based on hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation that explicitly incorporate outflows from star-forming galaxies. Our main result is that out-flow parametrizations derived from observations of local starburst galaxies, in particular momentum-driven wind scenarios, provide the best agreement with observations of C {IV} absorption at z ∼ 2-5. Such models sufficiently enrich the high-z {IGM} to produce a global mass density of {CIV} absorbers that is relatively invariant from z = 5.5 → 1.5, in agreement with observations. This occurs despite continual {IGM} enrichment causing an increase in volume-averaged metallicity by ∼ × 5-10 over this redshift range, because energy input accompanying the enriching outflows causes a drop in the global ionization fraction of C {IV}. Comparisons to observed {CIV} column density and linewidth distributions and {CIV}-based pixel optical depth ratios provide significant constraints on wind models. Our best-fitting outflow models show mean {IGM} temperatures only slightly above our no-outflow case, metal filling factors of just a few per cent with volume-weighted metallicities around 10-3 at z ∼ 3, significant amounts of collisionally ionized C {IV} absorption and a metallicity-density relationship that rises rapidly at low overdensities and flattens at higher ones. In general, we find that outflow speeds must be high enough to enrich the low-density {IGM} at early times but low enough not to overheat it, and concurrently must significantly suppress early star formation while still producing enough early metals. It is therefore non-trivial that locally calibrated momentum-driven wind scenarios naturally yield the desired strength and evolution of outflows, and suggest that such models represent a significant step towards understanding the impact of galactic outflows on galaxies and the {IGM} across cosmic time. © 2006 {RAS}.},

We present its spectacular extraplanar tails of ionized and molecular gas, {UV} stellar light, X-ray and radio continuum emission. This galaxy represents an excellent laboratory to study the interplay between different gas phases and star formation, and the influence of gas stripping, gas heating, and {AGN}. We analyze the physical origin of the emission at different wavelengths in the tail, in particular in-situ star formation (related to Halpha, {CO} and {UV} emission), synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons (producing the radio continuum) and heating of the stripped interstellar medium ({ISM}) (responsible for the X-ray emission). We show the similarities and differences of the spatial distributions of ionized gas, molecular gas and {UV} light, and argue that the mismatch on small scales (1kpc) is due to different stages of the star formation process. We present the relation Halpha--X-ray surface brightness, which is steeper for star-forming regions than for diffuse ionised gas regions with high [{OI}]/Halpha ratio. We propose that {ISM} heating due to interaction with the intracluster medium (either for mixing, thermal conduction or shocks) is responsible for the X-ray tail, the observed [{OI}]-excess and the lack of star formation in the northern part of the tail. We also report the tentative discovery in the tail of the most distant (and among the brightest) currently known {ULX}, a point-like ultraluminous X-ray source commonly originating in a binary stellar system powered either by an intermediate-mass black hole or a magnetized neutron star.},

Feedback from active galactic nuclei causes an upturn in the mass loading for halo masses \${\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. We find that more gas outflows through the halo virial radius than is removed from the {ISM} of galaxies, particularly at low redshift, implying substantial mass loading within the circum-galactic medium.

	abstract = {Supernovae ({SNe}) drive multiphase galactic outflows, impacting galaxy formation; however, cosmological simulations mostly use {\textbackslash}textit\{ad hoc\} feedback models for outflows, making outflow-related predictions from first principles problematic. Recent small-box simulations resolve individual {SNe} remnants in the interstellar medium ({ISM}), naturally driving outflows and permitting a determination of the wind loading factors of energy {\textbackslash}{etaE}, mass {\textbackslash}etam, and metals {\textbackslash}{etaZ}. In this Letter, we compile small-box results, and find consensus that the hot outflows are much more powerful than the cool outflows: (i) their energy flux is 2-20 times greater, and (ii) their specific energy \$e\_\{s,h\}\$ is 10-1000 times higher. Moreover, the properties of hot outflows are remarkably simple: \$e\_\{s,h\} {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}eta\_\{E,h\}/{\textbackslash}eta\_\{m,h\}\$ is almost invariant over four orders of magnitude of star formation surface density. Also, we find tentatively that \${\textbackslash}eta\_\{E,h\}/{\textbackslash}eta\_\{Z,h\} {\textbackslash}sim\$ 0.5. If corroborated by more simulation data, these correlations reduce the three hot phase loading factors into one. Finally, this one parameter is closely related to whether the {ISM} has a "breakout" condition. The narrow range of {\textbackslash}esh{\textbackslash} indicates that hot outflows cannot escape dark matter halos with log \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{halo\}\}{\textbackslash} [M\_{\textbackslash}odot] {\textbackslash}gtrsim 12\$. This mass is also where the galaxy mass-metallicity relation reaches its plateau, implying a deep connection between {\textbackslash}textit\{hot\} outflows and galaxy formation. We argue that hot outflows should be included explicitly in cosmological simulations and (semi-)analytic modeling of galaxy formation.},

	title = {The Impact of Wind Scalings on Stellar Growth and the Baryon Cycle in Cosmological Simulations},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08199},
	abstract = {Many phenomenologically successful cosmological galaxy formation simulations employ kinetic winds to model galactic outflows, a crucial ingredient in obtaining predictions that agree with various observations. Yet systematic studies of how variations in kinetic wind scalings might alter observable galaxy properties are rare. Here we employ {GADGET}-3 simulations to study how the baryon cycle, stellar mass function, and other galaxy and {CGM} predictions vary as a function of the assumed outflow speed \$v\_w\$ and the scaling of the mass loading factor \${\textbackslash}eta\$ with velocity dispersion \${\textbackslash}sigma\$. We design our fiducial model to reproduce the measured wind properties at 25\% of the virial radius from the Feedback In Realistic Environments ({FIRE}) simulations. We find that a strong dependence of \${\textbackslash}eta {\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}5\$ in low mass haloes with \${\textbackslash}sigma {\textless} 106{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textbackslash} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ is required to match the faint end of the stellar mass functions at \$z {\textgreater} 1\$. The wind speed also has a major impact, with faster winds significantly reducing wind recycling and heating more halo gas. Both effects result in less stellar mass growth in massive haloes and impact high ionization absorption in halo gas. We cannot simultaneously match the stellar content at \$z=2\$ and \$z=0\$ within a single model, suggesting that an additional feedback source such as {AGN} might be required in massive galaxies at lower redshifts, but the amount needed depends strongly on assumptions regarding the outflow properties. We run a 50 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc/h\}\$, \$2{\textbackslash}times576{\textasciicircum}3\$ simulation with our fiducial parameters and show that it matches a range of star-forming galaxy properties at \$z{\textbackslash}sim0-2\$. In closing, the results from simulations of galaxy formation are much more sensitive to small changes in the feedback implementation than to the hydrodynamic technique.},

	abstract = {We use high-resolution, multi-band imaging of {\textasciitilde}16,500 galaxies in the {CANDELS} fields at 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 to study the evolution of color gradients and half-mass radii over cosmic time. We find that galaxy color gradients at fixed mass evolve rapidly between z{\textasciitilde}2.5 and z{\textasciitilde}1, but remain roughly constant below z{\textasciitilde}1. This result implies that the sizes of both star-forming and quiescent galaxies increase much more slowly than previous studies found using half-light radii. The half-mass radius evolution of quiescent galaxies is fully consistent with a model which uses observed minor merger rates to predict the increase in sizes due to the accretion of small galaxies. Progenitor bias may still contribute to the growth of quiescent galaxies, particularly if we assume a slower timescale for the minor merger growth model. The slower half-mass radius evolution of star-forming galaxies is in tension with cosmological simulations and semi-analytic galaxy models. Further detailed, consistent comparisons with simulations are required to place these results in context.},

We show that the metallicity probability distribution function of the {SLFSs} at z{\textless}1 is unimodal, skewed to low metallicities with a mean and median of [X/H]=-1.47\$ and -1.18 dex. Very metal-poor gas with [X/H]{\textless}-1.4 represents about half of the population of absorbers with 15{\textless}log N({HI}){\textless}18. Thus, there are important reservoirs of primitive (though not pristine) gas around z{\textless}1 galaxies. The photoionized gas around z{\textless}1 galaxies is highly inhomogeneous based on the wide range of metallicities observed (-3{\textless}[X/H]{\textless}+0.4) and that there are large metallicity variations (factors of 2 to 25) for most of the closely-spaced absorbers (Dv{\textless}300 km/s) along the same sightlines. These absorbers show a complex evolution with redshift and {HI} column density, and we identify subtle cosmic evolution effects that affect the interpretation of metallicity distributions and comparison with other of absorbers samples. We discuss the physical conditions and cosmic baryon and metal budgets of the {CCC} absorbers. Finally, we compare the {CCC} results to recent cosmological zoom simulations and explore the origins of the 15{\textless}log N({HI}){\textless}19 absorbers within the {EAGLE} high-resolution simulations.},

Using different theoretical backgrounds from various areas including behavioral economics, game theory, and complex adaptive systems, the contributors aim to help readers avoid common problems and difficulties that they could face with poor implementation. The book’s contributors are scholars and academics from the many areas where the key theory of gamification typically comes from. Ultimately, the book’s goal is to help bring together the theories from these different disciplines to the field of practice in education and business. The book is divided into four parts: Theory, Education, Business, and Use Cases. Part I provides a foundation on the theory of gamification and offers insight into some of the outstanding questions that have yet to be addressed. In Part {II}, the application and value that gamification can bring within the education sector is examined. The book then changes focus in Part {III} to spotlight the use of gamification within business environments. The topics also cover educational aspects like improved learning outcomes, motivation, and learning retention at the workplace. Finally Part {IV} concentrates on the applications and use of gamification through a series of case studies and key elements that are used in real situations to drive real results.},

Usually summarized as “gamification”, this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human- computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how “gamification” relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate “gamification” and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that “gamified” applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of “gamification” as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

We obtain a best fit {\textbackslash}mthod{\textbackslash}, for each tracer and describe the host halo properties of these galaxies. The mean halo masses for {LRGs}, {ELGs} and {QSOs} are found to be \$1.9 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} {\textbackslash}msolaroh\$, \$1.1 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} {\textbackslash}msolaroh\$ and \$5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} {\textbackslash}msolaroh\$ respectively in the {eBOSS} data. We use the {\textbackslash}texttt\{{MTHOD}\} framework to create mock galaxy catalogues and predict auto- and cross-correlation functions for all the tracers. Comparing these results with data, we investigate galactic conformity, the phenomenon whereby the properties of neighbouring galaxies are mutually correlated in a manner that is not captured by the basic halo model. We detect {\textbackslash}textsl\{1-halo\} conformity at more than 3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ statistical significance, while obtaining upper limit on {\textbackslash}textsl\{2-halo\} conformity. We also look at the environmental dependence of the galaxy quenching efficiency and find that halo mass driven quenching successfully explains the behaviour in high density regions, but it fails to describe the quenching efficiency in low density regions. In particular, we show that the quenching efficiency in low density filaments is higher in the observed data, as compared to the prediction of the {\textbackslash}mthod{\textbackslash} with halo mass driven quenching.

Searching for typical signatures of outflows in the high-velocity tails of the stacked [C {II}] profile, we observe (i) deviations from a single-component Gaussian model in the combined residuals and (ii) broad emission in the stacked [C {II}] spectrum, at velocities of {\textbar}v{\textbar}{\textless}{\textasciitilde} 500 km/s. Interestingly, the significance of these features increases when stacking the sub-group of galaxies with star formation rates ({SFRs}) higher than the median ({SFRmed} = 25 Msun/yr), confirming their star formation-driven nature. The estimated typical mass outflow rates are comparable with the {SFRs}, yielding mass-loading factors of the order of unity (similarly to local normal star-forming galaxies), thus suggesting that star formation-driven feedback does not play a dominant role in quenching galaxies at z {\textgreater} 4. From the stacking analysis of the datacubes, we find that the combined [C {II}] core emission ({\textbar}v{\textbar}{\textless} 200 km/s) of the higher {SFR} galaxies extends on physical sizes of {\textasciitilde}30 kpc (diameter scale), well beyond the analogous [C {II}] core emission of lower {SFR} galaxies and the stacked {FIR}-continuum. The detection of such extended metal-enriched gas, likely tracing circumgalactic gas enriched by past outflows, corroborates previous similar studies, confirming that baryon cycle and gas exchanges with the circumgalactic medium are at work in normal star-forming galaxies already at early epochs.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04167},
	abstract = {Stellar-feedback driven outflows are predicted to play a fundamental role in the baryon cycle of low-mass galaxies. However, observational constraints of winds in nearby dwarf galaxies are limited as outflows are transient, intrinsically low-surface brightness features, and, thus, difficult to detect. Using deep Hapha observations, we search for winds in a sample of twelve nearby dwarfs (M\_* {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}7 - 10{\textasciicircum}9.3 Msun) which host on-going or recent starbursts. We detect features which we classify as winds in 6 galaxies, fountain candidates in 5 galaxies, and diffuse {ISM} in 1 system. Winds are found preferentially in galaxies with centrally concentrated star formation, while fountains are found in galaxies with spatially distributed star formation. We suggest that the concentration of star formation is a predictor for whether a low-mass galaxy will develop a wind. The spatial extent of all detected ionized gas is limited ({\textless}1/10 virial radius) and would still be considered the {ISM} by cosmological simulations. Our observations suggest that the majority of material expelled from dwarfs does not escape to the intergalactic medium but remains in the halo and may be recycled to the galaxies. Derived mass-loading factors range from 0.2-7 (with only a weak dependency on circular velocity or stellar mass), in tension with higher values in simulations needed to reproduce realistic low-mass galaxies and resolve discrepancies with {LambdaCDM}. The sample is part of the panchromatic {STARBurst} {IRegular} Dwarf Survey - {STARBIRDS} - designed to characterize the starburst phenomenon in dwarf galaxies. We also report a previously uncatalogued nearby galaxy (J1118+7913).},

Galaxy {ISM} metallicities were measured using Ha/[{NII}] emission lines from Keck/{ESI} spectra. {CGM} single-phase low-ionization metallicities were modeled using {MCMC} and Cloudy analysis of absorption from {HST}/{COS} and Keck/{HIRES} or {VLT}/{UVES} quasar spectra. We find that the star-forming galaxy {ISM} metallicities follow the observed stellar mass metallicity relation (scatter 0.19dex). {CGM} metallicity shows no dependence with stellar mass and exhibits a scatter of {\textasciitilde}2dex. All {CGM} metallicities are lower than the galaxy {ISM} metallicities and are offset by log({dZ})=-1.17+/-0.11. There is no obvious metallicity gradient as a function of impact parameter or virial radius ({\textless}2.3 sigma). There is no relationship between the relative {CGM}-galaxy metallicity and azimuthal angle. We find the mean metallicity differences along the major and minor axes are -1.13+/-0.18 and -1.23+/-0.11, respectively. Regardless of whether we examine our sample by low/high inclination or low/high impact parameter, or low/high N({HI}), we do not find any significant relationship with relative {CGM}-galaxy metallicity and azimuthal angle. We find that 10/15 low column density systems ({logN}({HI}){\textless}17.2) reside along the galaxy major axis while high column density systems ({logN}({HI}){\textgreater}17.2) reside along the minor axis. This suggest N({HI}) could be a useful indicator of accretion/outflows. We conclude that {CGM} is not well mixed, given the range of galaxy-{CGM} metallicities, and that metallicity at low redshift might not be a good tracer of {CGM} processes. Furthermore we should replace integrated line-of-sight, single phase, metallicities with multi-phase, cloud-cloud metallicities, which could be more indicative of the physical processes within the {CGM}.},

	abstract = {Black hole feedback plays a central role in shaping the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) of elliptical galaxies. We systematically study the impact of plasma physics on the evolution of ellipticals by performing three-dimensional non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the interactions of active galactic nucleus ({AGN}) jets with the {CGM} including magnetic fields, and cosmic rays ({CRs}) and their transport processes. We find that the physics of feedback operating on large galactic scales depends very sensitively on plasma physics operating on small scales. Specifically, we demonstrate that: (i) in the purely hydrodynamical case, the {AGN} jets initially maintain the atmospheres in global thermal balance. However, local thermal instability generically leads to the formation of massive cold disks in the vicinity of the central black hole in disagreement with observations; (ii) including weak magnetic fields prevents the formation of the disks because local B-field amplification in the precipitating cold gas leads to strong magnetic breaking, which quickly extracts angular momentum from the accreting clouds. The magnetic fields transform the cold clouds into narrow filaments that do not fall ballistically; (iii) when plasma composition in the {AGN} jets is dominated by {CRs}, and {CR} transport is neglected, the atmospheres exhibit cooling catastrophes due to inefficient heat transfer from the {AGN} to {CGM} despite Coulomb/hadronic {CR} losses being present; (iv) including {CR} streaming and heating restores agreement with the observations, i.e., cooling catastrophes are prevented and massive cold central disks do not form.

	title = {Constraining the scatter in the galaxy-halo connection at Milky Way masses},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03605},
	abstract = {We develop and implement two new methods for constraining the scatter in the relationship between galaxies and dark matter halos. These new techniques are sensitive to the scatter at low halo masses, making them complementary to previous constraints that are dependent on clustering amplitudes or rich galaxy groups, both of which are only sensitive to more massive halos. In both of our methods, we use a galaxy group finder to locate central galaxies in the {SDSS} main galaxy sample. Our first technique uses the small-scale cross-correlation of central galaxies with all lower mass galaxies. This quantity is sensitive to the satellite fraction of low-mass galaxies, which is in turn driven by the scatter between halos and galaxies. The second technique uses the kurtosis of the distribution of line-of-sight velocities between central galaxies and neighboring galaxies. This quantity is sensitive to the distribution of halo masses that contain the central galaxies at fixed stellar mass. Theoretical models are constructed using peak halo circular velocity, \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\}\$, as our property to connect galaxies to halos. The cross-correlation technique yields a constraint of \${\textbackslash}sigma[ M\_{\textbackslash}ast{\textbar}V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\}]=0.27{\textbackslash}pm 0.05\$ dex, corresponding to a scatter in \${\textbackslash}log M\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ at fixed \$M\_h\$ of \${\textbackslash}sigma[ M\_{\textbackslash}ast{\textbar}M\_h]=0.38{\textbackslash}pm 0.06\$ dex at \$M\_h=10{\textasciicircum}\{11.8\}\$ Msun. The kurtosis technique yields \${\textbackslash}sigma[ M\_{\textbackslash}ast{\textbar}V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\}]=0.30{\textbackslash}pm0.03\$, corresponding to \${\textbackslash}sigma[ M\_{\textbackslash}ast{\textbar}M\_h]=0.34{\textbackslash}pm 0.04\$ at \$M\_h=10{\textasciicircum}\{12.2\}\$ Msun. The values of \${\textbackslash}sigma[ M\_{\textbackslash}ast{\textbar}M\_h]\$ are significantly larger than the constraints at higher masses, in agreement with the results of hydrodynamic simulations. This increase is only partly due to the scatter between \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\}\$ and \$M\_h\$, and it represents an increase of nearly a factor of two relative to the values inferred from clustering and group studies at high masses.},

Here we measure the average velocity offset for a sample of 96 z {\textasciitilde} 3.3 Ly{\textbackslash}alpha emitters ({LAEs}) with a median Ly{\textbackslash}alpha flux (luminosity) of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{-17\} erg cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} ({\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{42\} erg s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}) and a median unobscured star formation rate ({SFR}) of {\textasciitilde}1.3 Msun/yr, detected by the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer as part of our {MUSEQuBES} circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) survey. By postulating that the stacked {CGM} absorption profiles of these {LAEs}, probed by 8 background quasars, must be centered on the systemic redshift, we measure an average velocity offset, Voffset = 169 {\textbackslash}pm 10 km/s, between the Ly{\textbackslash}alpha emission peak and the systemic redshift. The observed Voffset is lower by factors of {\textasciitilde}1.4 and {\textasciitilde}2.6 compared to the velocity offsets measured for narrow-band selected {LAEs} and Lyman break galaxies, respectively, which probe galaxies with higher masses and {SFRs}. Consistent with earlier studies based on direct measurements for individual objects, we find that the Voffset is correlated with the full width at half-maximum of the red peak of the Ly{\textbackslash}alpha line, and anti-correlated with the rest-frame equivalent width. Moreover, we find that Voffset is correlated with {SFR} with a sub-linear scaling relation, Voffset {\textasciitilde} {SFR}{\textasciicircum}(0.16 {\textbackslash}pm 0.03). Adopting the mass scaling for main sequence galaxies, such a relation suggests that Voffset scales with the circular velocity of the dark matter halos hosting the {LAEs}.},

	title = {Quenching as a Contest between Galaxy Halos and their Central Black Holes},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10817},
	abstract = {Existing models of galaxy formation have not yet been shown to explain key correlations between structure and star-formation activity. We offer a schematic model for quenching central galaxies that explains the tilted boundaries between star-forming and quiescent galaxies seen at all redshifts \$z\$ = 0-3 in their size\$-\$stellar mass and central-density\$-\$stellar mass distributions. The key idea is that larger star-forming galaxies (at fixed stellar mass) have lower black-hole masses owing to their lower central densities. Galaxies quench when the total effective energy radiated by their black holes equals an empirical function of their halo mass, and this function proves to be closely equal to a multiple of halo-gas binding energy. Since larger-radii galaxies start with smaller black holes, they must evolve to higher stellar masses before quenching, which produces the observed tilted boundaries. The quenching boundary proves to be almost parallel to the evolutionary tracks of individual galaxies; it is the evolution of the boundary, rather than the evolution of a galaxy, that leads to quenching. A candidate explanation for radii differences is differences in halo concentration and/or mean halo formation time at fixed halo mass. Implications include: radius is an important second parameter in shaping the life histories of galaxies and their black holes; most {BH} mass growth takes place in the green valley; galaxies enter the {GV} when their cumulative {BH} energy equals roughly 4\${\textbackslash}times\$ their halo-gas binding energy; star-forming, green valley, and quenched galaxies have different {BH} scaling laws; black holes are closely connected to their halos but in different ways for quenched, {GV}, and star-forming galaxies; and the same {BH}-quenching mechanism has existed since \$z = 3\$.},

The transition of these two phases occurs at \$z{\textbackslash}sim1.5\$, which is consistent with the onset redshift of the decline of cosmic star formation rate density. This provides evidence to support the idea that the decline of cosmic star formation rate density since \$z{\textbackslash}sim1.5\$ is mainly resulted from the decline of baryon net accretion rate and star formation quenching in galaxies.},

This suggests that {MAMMOTH}1-{QSO} has a proximity zone where quasar illuminates and photo-ionizes the surrounding {HI} gas and suppresses {HI} absorption, and that the {ELAN} is probably a photo-ionized cloud embedded in the cosmic web. The {HI} radial profile of {MAMMOTH}1-{QSO} is very similar to those of three neighbouring type-I quasars at \$z=2.3\$, which is compatible with the {AGN} unification model. We compare the distributions of the {HI} absorption and star-forming galaxies in our survey volume, and identify a spatial offset between density peaks of star-forming galaxies and {HI} gas.

By tracing the distribution of metals in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}), we show that {\textbackslash}ion\{O\}\{6\} is a sensitive indicator of supermassive black hole ({SMBH}) feedback. First, we calculate the column densities of {\textbackslash}ion\{O\}\{6\} in simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies and compare them with observations from the {COS}-Halos Survey. Our simulations show column densities of {\textbackslash}ion\{O\}\{6\} in the {CGM} consistent with those of {COS}-Halos star forming and quenched galaxies. These results contrast with those from previous simulation studies which typically underproduce {CGM} column densities of {\textbackslash}ion\{O\}\{6\}. We determine that a galaxy's star formation history and assembly record have little effect on the amount of {\textbackslash}ion\{O\}\{6\} in its {CGM}. Instead, column densities of {\textbackslash}ion\{O\}\{6\} are closely tied to galaxy halo mass and {BH} growth history. The set of zoom-in, genetically modified Milky Way-mass galaxies indicates that the {SMBH} drives highly metal-enriched material out into its host galaxy's halo which in turn elevates the column densities of {\textbackslash}ion\{O\}\{6\} in the {CGM}.},

	abstract = {We quantify the gas-phase abundance of deuterium and fractional contribution of stellar mass loss to the gas in cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback In Realistic Environments project. At low metallicity, our simulations confirm that the deuterium abundance is very close to the primordial value. The chemical evolution of the deuterium abundance that we derive here agrees quantitatively with analytical chemical evolution models. We furthermore find that the relation between the deuterium and oxygen abundance exhibits very little scatter. We compare our simulations to existing high-redshift observations in order to determine a primordial deuterium fraction of 2.549 +/- 0.033 x 10{\textasciicircum}-5 and stress that future observations at higher metallicity can also be used to constrain this value. At fixed metallicity, the deuterium fraction decreases slightly with decreasing redshift, due to the increased importance of mass loss from intermediate-mass stars. We find that the evolution of the average deuterium fraction in a galaxy correlates with its star formation history. Our simulations are consistent with observations of the Milky Way's interstellar medium: the deuterium fraction at the solar circle is 85-92 per cent of the primordial deuterium fraction. We use our simulations to make predictions for future observations. In particular, the deuterium abundance is lower at smaller galactocentric radii and in higher mass galaxies, showing that stellar mass loss is more important for fuelling star formation in these regimes (and can even dominate). Gas accreting onto galaxies has a deuterium fraction above that of the galaxies' interstellar medium, but below the primordial fraction, because it is a mix of gas accreting from the intergalactic medium and gas previously ejected or stripped from galaxies.},

	abstract = {Two of the dominant channels to produce merging stellar-mass black-hole binaries are believed to be the isolated evolution of binary stars in the field and dynamical formation in star clusters. The first black-hole binary event from the third {LIGO}/Virgo observing run ({GW}190412) is unusual in that it has unequal masses, nonzero effective spin, and nonzero primary spin at 90\% confidence interval. We show that this event should be exceedingly rare in the context of both the field and cluster formation scenarios. Interpreting {GW}190412 as a remnant of a previous black-hole merger provides a promising route to explain its features. If {GW}190412 indeed formed hierarchically, we show that the region of the parameter space which is best motivated from an astrophysical standpoint (low natal spins and light clusters) cannot accommodate the observation. We analyze public {GW}190412 {LIGO}/Virgo data with a Bayesian prior where the more massive black hole resulted from a previous merger, and find that this scenario is equally supported by the data. If the heavier component of {GW}190412 is indeed a merger remnant, then its spin magnitude is \${\textbackslash}chi\_1=0.56\_\{-0.21\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.19\}\$, higher than the value previously reported by the {LIGO}/Virgo collaboration.},

Spaxels covering the galaxy stellar regions show clear P-Cygni-like emission/absorption profiles with the blueshifted absorption extending to relative velocities of v = -800 km/s; however, the P-Cygni profiles give way to pure emission at large radii from the central galaxy. We have performed three-dimensional radiative transfer modeling to infer the geometry and velocity and density profiles of the outflowing gas. Our observations are most consistent with an isotropic outflow rather than biconical wind models with half-opening angles phi {\textless}= 80 deg. Furthermore, our modeling suggests that a wind velocity profile that decreases with radius is necessary to reproduce the velocity widths and strengths of Mg {II} line emission profiles at large circumgalactic radii.

To understand the origins of these features, we perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of the simulations, and find 18 correlations describing the assembly of \$L{\textasciicircum}*\$ galaxies and their dark matter haloes based on their {GC} population kinematics. The correlations arise because the orbital distributions of accreted and in-situ {GCs} depend on the masses and accretion redshifts of accreted satellites, driven by the combined effects of dynamical fraction, tidal stripping, and dynamical heating. Because the kinematics of in-situ/accreted {GCs} are broadly traced by the metal-rich/metal-poor and inner/outer populations, the observed {GC} kinematics are a sensitive probe of galaxy assembly. We predict that relative to the population of \$L{\textasciicircum}*\$ galaxies, the {MW} assembled its dark matter and stellar mass rapidly through a combination of in-situ star formation, more than a dozen low-mass mergers, and \$1.4{\textbackslash}pm1.2\$ early (\$z=3.1{\textbackslash}pm1.3\$) major merger. The rapid assembly period ended early, limiting the fraction of accreted stars. We conclude by providing detailed quantitative predictions for the assembly history of the {MW}.},

A diverse range of galaxy properties are seen around these {LLSs}, from a low-mass dwarf galaxy pair, a co-rotating gaseous halo/disk, a star-forming galaxy, a massive quiescent galaxy, to a galaxy group. The closest galaxies have projected distances ranging from d=15 to 72 pkpc and intrinsic luminosities from {\textasciitilde}0.01L* to {\textasciitilde}3L*. Our study shows that {LLSs} originate in a variety of galaxy environments and trace gaseous structures with a broad range of metallicities.},

	abstract = {Galaxy clusters are the most massive collapsed structures in the universe whose potential wells are filled with hot, X-ray emitting intracluster medium. Observations however show that a significant number of clusters (the so-called cool-core clusters) also contain large amounts of cold gas in their centres, some of which is in the form of spatially extended filaments spanning scales of tens of kiloparsecs. These findings have raised questions about the origin of the cold gas, as well as its relationship with the central active galactic nucleus ({AGN}), whose feedback has been established as a ubiquitous feature in such galaxy clusters. Here we report a radiation hydrodynamic simulation of {AGN} feedback in a galaxy cluster, in which cold filaments form from the warm, {AGN}-driven outflows with temperatures between \$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}7\$ K as they rise in the cluster core. Our analysis reveals a new mechanism, which, through the combination of radiative cooling and ram pressure, naturally promotes outflows whose cooling time is shorter than their rising time, giving birth to spatially extended cold gas filaments. Our results strongly suggest that the formation of cold gas and {AGN} feedback in galaxy clusters are inextricably linked and shed light on how {AGN} feedback couples to the intracluster medium.},

Using quasar spectra from {HST}/{COS} and from Keck/{HIRES} or {VLT}/{UVES} we measure column densities of, or determine limits on, {CGM} absorption lines. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach with Cloudy to estimate metallicities of cool (\$T{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}4\$K) {CGM} gas within groups and compare them to {CGM} metallicities of 47 isolated galaxies. Both group and isolated {CGM} metallicities span a wide range (\$-2{\textless}\$[Si/H]\${\textless}0\$), where the mean group (\$-0.54{\textbackslash}pm0.22\$) and isolated (\$-0.77{\textbackslash}pm0.14\$) {CGM} metallicities are similar. Group and isolated environments have similar distributions of \{{\textbackslash}{HI}\} column densities as a function of impact parameter. However, contrary to isolated galaxies, we do not find an anti-correlation between \{{\textbackslash}{HI}\} column density and the nearest group galaxy impact parameter. We additionally divided the groups by member luminosity ratios (i.e., galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-dwarf groups). While there was no significant difference in their mean metallicities, a modest increase in sample size should allow one to statistically identify a higher {CGM} metallicity in galaxy-dwarf groups compared to galaxy-galaxy groups. We conclude that either environmental effects have not played an important role in the metallicity of the {CGM} at this stage and expect that this may only occur when galaxies are strongly interacting or merging, or that some isolated galaxies have higher {CGM} metallicities due to past interactions. Thus, environment does not seem to be the cause of the {CGM} metallicity bimodality.},

We use the {CoDaII} simulation, which is a radiation hydrodynamic simulation featuring a box of \${\textbackslash}sim 94\$ comoving Mpc side length, to compute the Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ transmission properties of the intergalactic medium ({IGM}) at \$z{\textbackslash}sim 5.8\$ to \$7\$. Our results mainly confirm previous studies, i.e., we find a declining Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ transmission with redshift and a large sightline-to-sightline variation. However, motivated by the recent discovery of blue Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ peaks at high redshift, we also analyze the {IGM} transmission on the blue side, which shows a rapid decline at \$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim 6\$ of the blue transmission. This low transmission can be attributed not only to the presence of neutral regions but also to the residual neutral hydrogen within ionized regions, for which a density even as low as \$n\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {HI}\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-9\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ (sometimes combined with kinematic effects) leads to a significantly reduced visibility.

These simulations reach exquisite resolution in their circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) gas owing to {FOGGIE}'s novel refinement scheme. The {CGM} of each halo spans a wide dynamic range in density and velocity over its volume---roughly 6 dex and 1000 km/s, respectively---translating into a 5 dex range in ram pressure imparted to interacting satellites. The ram pressure profiles of the simulated {CGM} are highly stochastic, owing to kpc-scale variations of the density and velocity fields of the {CGM} gas. As a result, the efficacy of ram pressure stripping depends strongly on the specific path a satellite takes through the {CGM}. The ram-pressure history of a single satellite is generally unpredictable and not well correlated with its approach vector with respect to the host galaxy. The cumulative impact of ram pressure on the simulated satellites is dominated by only a few short strong impulses---on average, 90\% of the total surface momentum gained through ram pressure is imparted in 20\% or less of the total orbital time. These results reveal an erratic mode of ram pressure stripping in Milky-Way like halos at high redshift---one that is not captured by a smooth spherically-averaged model of the circumgalactic medium.},

	abstract = {We perform a comparison, object-by-object and statistically, between the Munich semi-analytical model, L-Galaxies, and the {IllustrisTNG} hydrodynamical simulations. By running L-Galaxies on the {IllustrisTNG} dark matter-only merger trees, we identify the same galaxies in the two models. This allows us to compare the stellar mass, star formation rate and gas content of galaxies, as well as the baryonic content of subhaloes and haloes in the two models. We find that both the stellar mass functions and the stellar masses of individual galaxies agree to better than \${\textbackslash}sim0.2{\textbackslash},\$dex. On the other hand, specific star formation rates and gas contents can differ more substantially. At \$z=0\$ the transition between low-mass star-forming galaxies and high-mass, quenched galaxies occurs at a stellar mass scale \${\textbackslash}sim0.5{\textbackslash},\$dex lower in {IllustrisTNG} than in L-Galaxies. {IllustrisTNG} also produces substantially more quenched galaxies at higher redshifts. Both models predict a halo baryon fraction close to the cosmic value for clusters, but {IllustrisTNG} predicts lower baryon fractions in group environments. These differences are due primarily to differences in modelling feedback from stars and supermassive black holes. The gas content and star formation rates of galaxies in and around clusters and groups differ substantially, with {IllustrisTNG} satellites less star-forming and less gas-rich. We show that environmental processes such as ram-pressure stripping are stronger and operate to larger distances and for a broader host mass range in {IllustrisTNG}. We suggest that the treatment of galaxy evolution in the semi-analytic model needs to be improved by prescriptions which capture local environmental effects more accurately.},

	abstract = {We extend our previous work on simulations with the code {RAMSES} on accretion driven turbulence by including self-gravity and study the effects of core formation and collapse. We show that radial accretion onto filaments drives turbulent motions which are not isotropic but radially dominated. In contrast to filaments without gravity, the velocity dispersion of self-gravitating filaments does not settle in an equilibrium. Despite showing similar amounts of driven turbulence, they continually dissipate their velocity dispersion until the onset of core formation. This difference is connected to the evolution of the radius as it determines the dissipation rate. In the non-gravitational case filament growth is not limited and its radius grows linearly with time. In contrast, there is a maximum extent in the self-gravitational case resulting in an increased dissipation rate. Furthermore, accretion driven turbulence shows a radial profile which is anti-correlated with density. This leads to a constant turbulent pressure throughout the filament. As the additional turbulent pressure does not have a radial gradient it does not contribute to the stability of filaments and does not increase the critical line-mass. However, this radial turbulence does affect the radius of a filament, adding to the extent and setting its maximum value. Moreover, the radius evolution also affects the growth timescale of cores which compared to the timescale of collapse of an accreting filament limits core formation to high line-masses.},

	abstract = {We analyze the cold dark matter density profiles of 54 galaxy halos simulated with {FIRE}-2 galaxy formation physics, each resolved within \$0.5{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the halo virial radius. These halos contain galaxies with masses that range from ultra-faint dwarfs (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}simeq 10{\textasciicircum}\{4.5\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) to the largest spirals (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}simeq 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) and have density profiles that are both cored and cuspy. We characterize our results using a new analytic density profile that extends the standard Einasto form to allow for a pronounced constant-density core in the resolved innermost radius. With one additional core-radius parameter, \$r\_\{c\}\$, this \{{\textbackslash}em core-Einasto\} profile is able to characterize the shape and normalization of our feedback-impacted dark matter halos. In order to enable comparisons with observations, we provide fitting functions for \$r\_\{c\}\$ and other profile parameters as a function of both \$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$ and \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}\$. In agreement with similar studies done in the literature, we find that dark matter core formation is most efficient at the characteristic stellar-mass to halo-mass ratio \$M\_{\textbackslash}star/M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\} {\textbackslash}simeq 5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, or \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}9 {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, with cores that are roughly the size of the galaxy half-light radius, \$r\_\{c\} {\textbackslash}simeq 1-5\$ kpc.

For Milky Way-size galaxies, baryonic contraction often makes halos significantly more concentrated and dense at the stellar half-light radius than dark matter only runs. However, even at the Milky Way scale, {FIRE}-2 galaxy formation still produces small dark matter cores of \${\textbackslash}simeq 0.5-2\$ kpc in size.

However, observational evidence has been elusive due to the low surface brightness of the filaments. Recent deep {MUSE}/{VLT} data and upcoming observations offer a promising avenue for Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ detection, motivating the development of modern theoretical predictions. We use hydrodynamical cosmological simulations run with the {AREPO} code to investigate the potential detectability of large-scale filaments, excluding contributions from the halos embedded in them. We focus on filaments connecting massive (\$M\_\{200c\}{\textbackslash}sim(1-3){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) halos at z=3, and compare different simulation resolutions, feedback levels, and mock-image pixel sizes. We find increasing simulation resolution does not substantially improve detectability notwithstanding the intrinsic enhancement of internal filament structure. By contrast, for a {MUSE} integration of 31 hours, including feedback increases the detectable area by a factor of \${\textbackslash}simeq\$5.5 on average compared with simulations without feedback, implying that even the non-bound components of the filaments have substantial sensitivity to feedback. Degrading the image resolution from the native {MUSE} scale of (0.2")\${\textasciicircum}2\$ per pixel to (5.3")\${\textasciicircum}2\$ apertures has the strongest effect, increasing the detectable area by a median factor of \${\textbackslash}simeq\$200 and is most effective when the size of the pixel roughly matches the width of the filament. Finally, we find the majority of Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission is due to electron impact collisional excitations, as opposed to radiative recombination.},

The shape of the spaxel-wise probability density function of normalised \$s=j\_*/j\_\{*mean\}\$, {PDF}(\$s\$), deviates significantly from the near-universal initial distribution expected of baryons in a dark matter halo and can be explained by the expected baryonic effects in galaxy formation that remove and redistribute angular momentum. Further we find that the observed shape of the {PDF}(\$s\$) correlates significantly with photometric morphology, where late-type galaxies have {PDF}(\$s\$) that is similar to a normal distribution, whereas early types have a strongly-skewed {PDF}(\$s\$) resulting from an excess of low-angular momentum material.

The {PDF}(\$s\$) encodes both kinematic and photometric information and appears to be a robust tracer of morphology. Its use is motivated by the desire to move away from traditional component-based classifications which are subject to observer bias, to classification on a galaxy's fundamental (stellar mass, angular momentum) properties.

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the angular momentum content of the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) using {TNG}100, one of the flagship runs of the {IllustrisTNG} project. We focus on Milky Way-mass halos (\${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} {\textbackslash}; M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) at \$z=0\$ but also analyze other masses and redshifts up to \$z=5\$. We find that the {CGM} angular momentum properties are strongly correlated with the stellar angular momentum of the corresponding galaxy: the {CGM} surrounding high-angular momentum galaxies has systematically higher angular momentum and is better aligned to the rotational axis of the galaxy itself than the {CGM} surrounding low-angular momentum galaxies. Both the hot and cold phases of the {CGM} show this dichotomy, though it is stronger for colder gas. The {CGM} of high-angular momentum galaxies is characterized by a large wedge of cold gas with rotational velocities at least \${\textbackslash}sim1/2\$ of the halo's virial velocity extending out to \${\textbackslash}sim 1/2\$ of the virial radius, and by biconical polar regions dominated by radial velocities suggestive of galactic fountains; both of these features are absent from the {CGM} of low-angular momentum galaxies. These conclusions are general to halo masses \${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} {\textbackslash}; M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and for \$z {\textbackslash}lesssim 2\$, but do not apply for more massive halos or at the highest redshift studied. By comparing simulations run with alterations to the fiducial feedback model, we identify the better alignment of the {CGM} to high-angular momentum galaxies as a feedback-independent effect and the galactic winds as a dominant influence on the {CGM}'s angular momentum.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0511773},
	abstract = {The two-point correlation function has been the standard statistic for quantifying how galaxies are clustered. The statistic uses the positions of galaxies, but not their properties. Clustering as a function of galaxy property, be it type, luminosity, color, etc., is usually studied by analysing a subset of the full population, the galaxies in the subset chosen because they have a similar range of properties. We explore an alternative technique---marked correlations---in which one weights galaxies by some property or `mark' when measuring clustering statistics. Marked correlations are particularly well-suited to quantifying how the properties of galaxies correlate with their environment. Therefore, measurements of marked statistics, with luminosity, stellar mass, color, star-formation rate, etc. as the mark, permit sensitive tests of galaxy formation models. We make measurements of such marked statistics in semi-analytic galaxy formation models to illustrate their utility. These measurements show that close pairs of galaxies are expected to be red, to have larger stellar masses, and to have smaller star formation rates. We also show that the simplest unbiased estimator of the particular marked statistic we use extensively is very simple to measure---it does not require construction of a random catalog---and provide an estimate of its variance. Large wide-field surveys of the sky are revolutionizing our view of galaxies and how they evolve. Our results indicate that application of marked statistics to this high quantity of high-quality data will provide a wealth of information about galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have revealed a population of galaxies in galaxy clusters with ram pressure stripped ({RPS}) tails of gas and embedded young stars. We observed 1.4 {GHz} continuum and {HI} emission with the Very Large Array in its B-configuration in two fields of the Coma cluster to study the radio properties of {RPS} galaxies. The best continuum sensitivities in the two fields are 6 and 8 \${\textbackslash}mu\$Jy per 4'' beam respectively, which are 4 and 3 times deeper than those previously published. Radio continuum tails are found in 10 (8 are new) out of 20 {RPS} galaxies, unambiguously revealing the presence of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields in the stripped tails. Our results also hint that the tail has a steeper spectrum than the galaxy. The 1.4 {GHz} continuum in the tails is enhanced relative to their H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim\$7 compared to the main bodies of the {RPS} galaxies. The 1.4 {GHz} continuum of the {RPS} galaxies is enhanced relative to their {IR} emission by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim\$2 compared to star-forming galaxies. The ram pressure interaction may enhanced the radio emission of the {RPS} galaxies, the tails were further enhanced for the stripping. We furthermore present {HI} detections in three {RPS} galaxies and upper limits for the other {RPS} galaxies. The cold gas in D100's stripped tail is dominated by molecular gas, which is likely a consequence of the high ambient pressure. No evidence of radio emission associated with ultra-diffuse galaxies is found in our data.},

	abstract = {Post starburst E+A galaxies are systems that hosted a powerful starburst that was quenched abruptly. Simulations suggest that these systems provide the missing link between major merger {ULIRGs} and red and dead ellipticals, where {AGN} feedback is responsible for the expulsion or destruction of the molecular gas. However, many details remain unresolved and little is known about {AGN}-driven winds in this short-lived phase. We present spatially-resolved {IFU} spectroscopy with {MUSE}/{VLT} of {SDSS} J124754.95-033738.6, a post starburst E+A galaxy with a recent starburst that started 70 Myrs ago and ended 30 Myrs ago, with a peak {SFR} of \${\textbackslash}sim 150{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}/yr\}\$. We detect disturbed gas throughout the entire field of view, suggesting triggering by a minor merger. We detect fast-moving multi-phased gas clouds, embedded in a double-cone face-on outflow, which are traced by ionized emission lines and neutral {NaID} {\textbackslash}emph\{emission\} and absorption lines. We find remarkable similarities between the kinematics, spatial extents, and line luminosities of the ionized and neutral gas phases, and propose a model in which they are part of the same outflowing clouds, which are exposed to both stellar and {AGN} radiation. Our photoionization model provides consistent ionized line ratios, {NaID} absorption optical depths and {EWs}, and dust reddening. Using the model, we estimate, for the first time, the neutral-to-ionized gas mass ratio (about 20), the sodium neutral fraction, and the size of the outflowing clouds. This is one of the best ever observed direct connections between the neutral and ionized outflow phases in {AGN}.},

These systems probe {AGN} feedback from nuclear to circumgalactic scales, and provide unique insights into the different mechanisms by which {AGN}-driven outflows interact with their host galaxies. K20-{ID}5 and {COS}4-11337 are compact star forming galaxies with powerful \${\textbackslash}sim\$1500 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ {AGN}-driven outflows that dominate their nuclear H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission. The outflows do not appear to have any impact on the instantaneous star formation activity of the host galaxies, but they carry a significant amount of kinetic energy which could heat the halo gas and potentially lead to a reduction in the rate of cold gas accretion onto the galaxies. The outflow from {COS}4-11337 is propagating directly towards its companion galaxy {COS}4-11363, at a projected separation of 5.4 kpc. {COS}4-11363 shows signs of shock excitation and recent truncation of star formation activity, which could plausibly have been induced by the outflow from {COS}4-11337. J0901+1814 is gravitationally lensed, giving us a unique view of a compact (R = 470 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 70 pc), relatively low velocity (\${\textbackslash}sim\$650 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) {AGN}-driven outflow. J0901+1814 has a similar {AGN} luminosity to {COS}4-11337, suggesting that the difference in outflow properties is not related to the current {AGN} luminosity, and may instead reflect a difference in the evolutionary stage of the outflow and/or the coupling efficiency between the {AGN} ionizing radiation field and the gas in the nuclear regions.},

	abstract = {Cosmic rays ({CRs}) with {\textasciitilde}{GeV} energies can contribute significantly to the energy and pressure budget in the interstellar, circumgalactic, and intergalactic medium ({ISM}, {CGM}, {IGM}). Recent cosmological simulations have begun to explore these effects, but almost all studies have been restricted to simplified models with constant {CR} diffusivity and/or streaming speeds. Physical models of {CR} propagation/scattering via extrinsic turbulence and self-excited waves predict transport coefficients which are complicated functions of local plasma properties. In a companion paper, we consider a wide range of observational constraints to identify proposed physically-motivated cosmic-ray propagation scalings which satisfy both detailed Milky Way ({MW}) and extra-galactic \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray constraints. Here, we compare the effects of these models relative to simpler 'diffusion+streaming' models on galaxy and {CGM} properties at dwarf through {MW} mass scales. The physical models predict large local variations in {CR} diffusivity, with median diffusivity increasing with galacto-centric radii and decreasing with galaxy mass and redshift. These effects lead to a more rapid dropoff of {CR} energy density in the {CGM} (compared to simpler models), in turn producing weaker effects of {CRs} on galaxy star formation rates ({SFRs}), {CGM} absorption profiles and galactic outflows. The predictions of the more physical {CR} models tend to lie 'in between' models which ignore {CRs} entirely and models which treat {CRs} with constant diffusivity.},

The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned—that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here I argue that most inferential statistical tests in psychology fail to meet this basic condi- tion. I demonstrate how foundational assumptions of the "random effects" model used pervasively in psychology impose far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints dramatically inflates false positive rates and routinely leads researchers to drawsweeping verbal generalizations that lack any meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that the routine failure to con- sider thegeneralizability ofone's conclusionsfroma statistical perspective lies at the root ofmany of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

	abstract = {The fate of cooling gas in the centers of galaxy clusters and groups is still not well understood, as is also the case for the complex processes of triggering star formation in central dominant galaxies ({CDGs}), re-heating of cooled gas by {AGN}, and the triggering/feeding of supermassive black hole outbursts. We present {CO} observations of the early type galaxy {NGC} 5044, which resides at the center of an X-ray bright group with a moderate cooling flow. For our analysis we combine {CO}(2-1) data from the 7m antennae of the Atacama Compact Array ({ACA}), and the {ACA} total power array ({TP}). We demonstrate, using the 7m array data, that we can recover the total flux inferred from {IRAM} 30m single dish observations, which corresponds to a total molecular mass of about 4x10{\textasciicircum}7 Msun. Most of the recovered flux is blueshifted with respect to the galaxy rest frame and is extended on kpc-scales, suggesting low filling factor dispersed clouds. We find 8 concentrations of molecular gas out to a radius of 10 arcsec (1.5 kpc), which we identify with giant molecular clouds. The total molecular gas mass is more centrally concentrated than the X-ray emitting gas, but extended in the north-east/south-west direction beyond the {IRAM} 30m beam. We also compare the spatial extent of the molecular gas to the Halpha emission: The {CO} emission coincides with the very bright Halpha region in the center. We do not detect {CO} emission in the fainter Halpha regions. Furthermore, we find two {CO} absorption features spatially located at the center of the galaxy, within 5 pc projected distance of the {AGN}, infalling at 255 and 265 km/s relative to the {AGN}. This indicates that the two giant molecular clouds seen in absorption are most likely within the sphere of influence of the supermassive black hole.},

The galaxies' histories are traced from the time of accretion to \$z=0\$ and compared to a control sample of central galaxies mass-matched at the time of accretion. Most cluster disks become non-disky by z=0, in stark contrast with the control disks, of which a significant fraction remains disky over the same timescales. The transformation to non-disky morphologies is accompanied by gas removal and star formation quenching for both cluster and control galaxies. However, cluster disks that become non-disky by z=0 have lost dark matter ({DM}) mass and show little growth or a loss of stellar mass, whereas the corresponding control disks show significant growth in both components. Most cluster satellites change their morphologies on similar timescales regardless of stellar mass, in {\textasciitilde}0.5-4 Gyr after accretion. Cluster disks that have had more numerous and closer pericentric passages show the largest change in morphology. Morphological change in both cluster and control disks requires the presence of a gravitational perturbation to drive stellar orbits to non-disky configurations, along with gas removal/heating to prevent replenishment of the disk through continued star-formation. For cluster disks, the perturbation is in the form of impulsive tidal shocking at pericentres and not tidal stripping of the outer disk stellar material, whereas for control disks, a combination of mergers and {AGN} feedback appears to be the key driving force behind morphological transformations.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00863},
	abstract = {The impact of the streaming motion between gas and dark matter on the first structure formation has been actively explored by recent studies. Here we investigate how much the key results are affected by two approximations made in many of those studies. One is to implement the streaming motion by accounting for only the relative velocity between baryons and dark matter while assuming "baryons trace dark matter" spatially at the initial conditions of the simulation. This assumption neglects the impact on the gas density taking place before the initialization. In our simulation initialized at \$z=200\$, this approximation overestimates the gas power spectrum up to 30{\textbackslash}\% at \$k{\textbackslash}approx10{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciitilde}h{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mbox\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at \$z=20\$. However, the halo mass function and the gas fraction in halos are minimally affected. The other approximation is to artificially amplify the density/velocity fluctuations in a cosmic mean density volume at the initialization to simulate the first minihalos. This approximation gives a head start to the halo growth and the subsequent growth rate is as fast as in the mean density. The growth in actual overdensity, however, is accelerated gradually in time. For example, increasing \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ by 50{\textbackslash}\% effectively transforms \$z{\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash}sqrt\{1.5\}z\$ in the halo mass growth history while in 2-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ overdensity the acceleration is described by \$z{\textbackslash}rightarrow\{z\}+4.8\$. Halos in the former case are more grown than in the latter before \$z{\textbackslash}approx27\$ and vice versa after. The gas fraction in halo remains unchanged by this second approximation as well, suggesting that those approximations do \{{\textbackslash}it\{not\}\} bias the {PopIII} star-formation rate significantly.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00021},
	abstract = {Observations since the 1970's have revealed the existence of cool-core ({CC}) clusters, which are galaxy clusters with a central cooling time much shorter than the age of the universe. Both observations and theory suggest that the ambient gas at the centers of galaxy clusters is thermally regulated by a central heating mechanism that suppresses condensation (most likely an active galactic nucleus, or {AGN}). Previous analytical work has suggested specific configurations of heating kernels that may result in thermal balance and a steady state. To test this hypothesis, we simulated idealized galaxy clusters using the {ENZO} cosmology code with a spatial heat-input kernel meant to mimic feedback from a central {AGN}. Thermal heating as a function of radius was injected according to a range of kernels, with global thermal balance enforced at all times. We compare our simulation results with observed entropy profiles from the {ACCEPT} cluster dataset. Although some heating kernels produced thermally steady galaxy clusters, no kernel was able to produce a steady cluster with a central entropy as low as the central entropies typically observed among {CC} clusters. The general behavior of the simulations depended on the amount of heating in the inner \$10 {\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{kpc\}\$, with low central heating leading to central cooling catastrophes, high central heating creating a central convective zone with an inverted entropy gradient, and intermediate heating leading to a flat but elevated entropy core. The simulated clusters enter an unsteady multiphase state on a timescale proportional to the square of the cooling time of the lowest entropy gas in the simulation, with centrally concentrated heating resulting in a steady state lasting for a longer period of time.},

Two {SGS} models are examined: the eddy diffusivity ({ED}) model wildly adopted in astrophysical simulations and the "gradient model" due to Clark et al. (1979). We find that both models predict the magnitude of the {SGS} terms equally well (correlation coefficient {\textgreater} 0.8). However, the gradient model provides excellent predictions on the orientation and shape of the {SGS} terms while the {ED} model predicts poorly on both, indicating that isotropic diffusion is a poor approximation of the instantaneous turbulent transport. The best-fit coefficient of the gradient model is in the range of [0.16, 0.21] for the momentum transport, and the turbulent Schmidt number and Prandtl number are both close to unity, in the range of [0.92, 1.15].},

The simulations indicate that the hot {CGM} of low-mass (M\_*{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\} Msol), high-{sSFR} (defined as the top one-third ranked by {sSFR}) central galaxies will be detectable to a galactocentric radius r{\textasciitilde}30-50 kpc. Both simulations predict lower luminosities at fixed stellar mass for the low-{sSFR} galaxies (the lower third of {sSFR}) with Illustris-{TNG} predicting 3x brighter coronae around high-{sSFR} galaxies than {EAGLE}. Both simulations predict detectable emission out to r{\textasciitilde}150-200 kpc for stacks centered on high-mass (M\_*{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{11.0\} Msol) galaxies, with {EAGLE} predicting brighter X-ray halos. The extended soft X-ray luminosity correlates strongly and positively with the mass of circumgalactic gas within the virial radius (f\_\{{CGM}\}). Prior analyses of both simulations have established that f\_\{{CGM}\} is reduced by expulsive feedback driven mainly by black hole growth, which quenches galaxy growth by inhibiting replenishment of the {ISM}. Both simulations predict that {eROSITA} stacks should not only conclusively detect and resolve the hot {CGM} around L{\textasciicircum}* galaxies for the first time, but provide a powerful probe of how the baryon cycle operates, for which there remains an absence of consensus between state-of-the-art simulations.},

	title = {Chemical Evolution of Galaxy Clusters: Dissecting the Iron Mass Budget of the Intracluster Medium},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12426},
	abstract = {We study the chemical evolution of galaxy clusters by measuring the iron mass in the {ICM} after dissecting the abundance profiles into different components. We use Chandra archival observations of 186 morphologically regular clusters in the redshift range [0.04, 1.07]. For each cluster we compute the iron abundance and gas density profiles. We aim at identifying in the iron distribution a central peak associated with the {BCG}, and an approximately constant plateau associated with early enrichment. We are able to firmly identify the two components in a significant fraction of the sample, simply relying on the fit of the abundance profile. We compute the iron mass included in the iron peak and plateau, and the gas mass-weighted iron abundance out to \$r\_\{500\}\$. While the iron plateau shows no evolution, we find marginal decrease with redshift in the iron peak. We measure that the fraction of iron peak mass is typically a few percent ({\textasciitilde}1\%) of the total iron mass within \$r\_\{500\}\$. Therefore, since the total iron mass budget is dominated by the plateau, we find consistently that the global gas mass-weighted iron abundance does not evolve significantly. We are also able to reproduce past claims of evolution in the global iron abundance, which turn out to be due to the use of cluster samples with different selection methods combined to the use of emission-weighted instead of gas mass-weighted abundance values. Finally, while the intrinsic scatter in the iron plateau mass is consistent with zero, the iron peak mass exhibits a large scatter, in line with the fact that the peak is produced after the virialization of the halo and depends on the formation of the hosting cool core and the associated feedback processes. We conclude that only a spatially-resolved approach can resolve the issue of the {ICM} iron evolution, reconciling the contradictory results obtained in the last ten years.},

Despite its prominent X-ray bubble, {RBS}0533 lacks significant levels of molecular gas. Cold gas is absent at appreciable levels in these systems perhaps because their radio sources have failed to lift low entropy atmospheric gas to an altitude where the ratio of the cooling time to the free-fall time falls below unity.},

Ejection velocities are taken to be ∼103 km s-1 at high Eddington ratios, increasing to ∼8000 km s-1 at Eddington ratios below 2 per cent, with a constant momentum input of 20L/c. {SIMBA} further includes an on-the-fly dust production, growth, and destruction model. Our {SIMBA} run with (100h -1 Mpc)3 and 10243 gas elements reproduces numerous observables, including galaxy stellar mass functions at z = 0-6, the stellar mass- star formation rate main sequence, {HI} and H2 fractions, the mass-metallicity relation at z ∼ 0, 2, star-forming galaxy sizes, hot gas fractions in massive haloes, and z = 0 galaxy dust properties. However, {SIMBA} also yields an insufficiently sharp truncation of the z = 0 mass function, and too-large sizes for low-mass quenched galaxies.

	abstract = {The stellar mass, size and rotational velocity of galactic disks all grow from redshift {\textasciitilde}2 to the present by amounts that are estimated from observationally derived scaling relations. The product of these three quantities, the angular momentum of stellar disks, is then estimated to grow by a remarkably large factor, between {\textasciitilde}20 and {\textasciitilde}50, whereas other evidences suggest a more moderate increase. This requires that the specific angular momentum of the accreted gas should systematically increase with time while remaining co-rotational with the disk over most of the last {\textasciitilde}10 Gyr. Thus, the baryonic gas vorticity of the circumgalactic medium appears to emerge as a major driver in galaxy evolution, and this paper is meant to attract attention on the sheer size of the angular momentum increase and on the need to explore to which extent this can be observed in nature and/or in simulations.},

	abstract = {The discovery of the coherence between galaxy rotation and neighbor motion in 1-Mpc scales has been reported recently. Following up the discovery, we investigate whether the neighbors in such dynamical coherence also present galaxy conformity, using the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area Survey ({CALIFA}) data and the {NASA}-Sloan Atlas ({NSA}) catalog. We measure the correlation coefficient of g - r colors between the {CALIFA} galaxies and their neighbors, as a quantitative indicator of galaxy conformity. The neighbors are divided into coherently moving and anti-coherently moving ones, the correlation coefficients from which are compared with each other, in various bins of relative luminosity and projected distance. In most cases, the {CALIFA} galaxies and their neighbors show positive correlation coefficients in g - r color, even for the anti-coherent neighbors. However, we find statistically significant (2.6-sigma) difference between coherent and anti-coherent neighbors, when the neighbor galaxies are bright (Delta Mr {\textless}= -1.0) and close (D {\textless}= 400 kpc). That is, when they are bright and close to the {CALIFA} galaxies, the coherently moving neighbors show stronger conformity with the {CALIFA} galaxies than the anti-coherently moving neighbors. This result supports that the small-scale dynamical coherence may originate from galaxy interactions as galaxy conformity is supposed to do, which agrees with the conclusion of the previous study.},

	abstract = {Using analytic modeling and simulations, we address the origin of an abundance of star-forming, clumpy, extended gas rings about massive central bodies in massive galaxies at \$z{\textbackslash}! {\textless}{\textbackslash}! 4\$. Rings form by high-angular-momentum streams and may survive in galaxies of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm star\} {\textbackslash}!{\textgreater}{\textbackslash}! 10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\}{\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ where merger-driven spin flips and supernova feedback are ineffective. The rings survive above this threshold mass after events of compaction to central nuggets. Ring longevity seemed to conflict with the expected inward mass transport driven by torques from violent disc instability. However, by evaluating the torques from a tightly wound spiral structure, we find that the timescale for transport per orbital time is \${\textbackslash}propto{\textbackslash}! {\textbackslash}delta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm d\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, with \${\textbackslash}delta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm d\}\$ the cold-to-total mass ratio interior to the ring. A long-lived ring forms when the ring transport is slower than its replenishment by accretion and the interior depletion by {SFR}, both valid for \${\textbackslash}delta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm d\} {\textbackslash}!{\textless}{\textbackslash}! 0.3\$. The central mass that lowers \${\textbackslash}delta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm d\}\$ and maintains the ring is made of compaction-driven bulge and/or dark-matter, aided by the lower gas fraction at lower \$z\$. The ring could be Toomre unstable for clump and star formation. Mock images of simulated rings through dust indicate qualitative consistency with observed rings about bulges in massive \$z{\textbackslash}!{\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}!0.5{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!3\$ galaxies, in \$H\_\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ and in deep {HST} imaging. {ALMA} mock images indicate that \$z{\textbackslash}!{\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}!0.5{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!1\$ rings should be detectable.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08390},
	abstract = {A common situation in galactic and intergalactic gas involves cold dense gas in motion relative to hot diffuse gas. Kelvin-Helmholtz instability creates a turbulent mixing layer and populates the intermediate-temperature phase, which often cools rapidly. The energy lost to cooling is balanced by the advection of hot high enthalpy gas into the mixing layer, resulting in growth and acceleration of the cold phase. This process may play a major role in determining the interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium phase structure, and accelerating cold gas in galactic winds and cosmic filaments. Cooling in these mixing layers occurs in a thin corrugated sheet, which we argue has an area with fractal dimension \$D=5/2\$ and a thickness that adjusts to match the hot phase mixing time to the cooling time. These cooling sheet properties form the basis of a new model for how the cooling rate and hot gas inflow velocity depend on the size \$L\$, cooling time \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}\$, relative velocity \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rel\}\$, and density contrast \${\textbackslash}rho\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cold\}/{\textbackslash}rho\_\{{\textbackslash}rm hot\}\$ of the system. Entrainment is expected to be enhanced in environments with short \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}\$, large \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rel\}\$, and large \${\textbackslash}rho\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cold\}/{\textbackslash}rho\_\{{\textbackslash}rm hot\}\$. Using a large suite of three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that this fractal cooling layer model accurately captures the energetics and evolution of turbulent interfaces and can therefore be used as a foundation for understanding multiphase mixing with strong radiative cooling.},

The positive values of \${\textbackslash}delta\$ found in {UGC} 5282 (and the other star forming galaxies) is likely due to infalling low metallicity gas from the intergalactic medium which mixes with the galaxy's {ISM} on kpc scales.

	abstract = {The dense environment of a galaxy cluster can radically transform the content of in-falling galaxies. Recent observations have found a significant population of active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) within "jellyfish galaxies," galaxies with trailing tails of gas and stars that indicate significant ram pressure stripping. The relationship between {AGN} and ram pressure stripping is not well understood. In this letter, we investigate the connection between {AGN} activity and ram pressure in a fully cosmological setting for the first time using the {RomulusC} simulation, one of the highest resolution simulations of a galaxy cluster to date. We find unambiguous morphological evidence for ram pressure stripping. For lower mass galaxies (with stellar masses {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}9.5 solar masses) both star formation and black hole accretion are suppressed by ram pressure before they reach pericenter, whereas for more massive galaxies accretion onto the black hole is enhanced during pericentric passage. Our analysis also indicates that as long as the galaxy retains gas, {AGN} with higher Eddington ratios are more likely to be the found in galaxies experiencing higher ram pressure. We conclude that prior to quenching star formation, ram pressure triggers enhanced accretion onto the black hole, which then produces heating and outflows due to {AGN} feedback. {AGN} feedback may in turn serve to aid in the quenching of star formation in tandem with ram pressure.},

	abstract = {We report on the determination of electron densities, and their impact on the outflow masses and rates, measured in the central few hundred parsecs of 11 local luminous active galaxies. We show that the peak of the integrated line emission in the {AGN} is significantly offset from the systemic velocity as traced by the stellar absorption features, indicating that the profiles are dominated by outflow. In contrast, matched inactive galaxies are characterised by a systemic peak and weaker outflow wing. We present three independent estimates of the electron density in these {AGN}, discussing the merits of the different methods. The electron density derived from the [{SII}] doublet is significantly lower than than that found with a method developed in the last decade using auroral and transauroral lines, as well as a recently introduced method based on the ionization parameter. The reason is that, for gas photoionized by an {AGN}, much of the [{SII}] emission arises in an extended partially ionized zone where the implicit assumption that the electron density traces the hydrogen density is invalid. We propose ways to deal with this situation and we derive the associated outflow rates for ionized gas, which are in the range 0.001--0.5 M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for our {AGN} sample.

	abstract = {Modern cosmology predicts that matter in our Universe has assembled today into a vast network of filamentary structures colloquially termed the Cosmic Web. Because this matter is either electromagnetically invisible (i.e., dark) or too diffuse to image in emission, tests of this cosmic web paradigm are limited. Wide-field surveys do reveal web-like structures in the galaxy distribution, but these luminous galaxies represent less than 10\% of baryonic matter. Statistics of absorption by the intergalactic medium ({IGM}) via spectroscopy of distant quasars support the model yet have not conclusively tied the diffuse {IGM} to the web. Here, we report on a new method inspired by the Physarum polycephalum slime mold that is able to infer the density field of the Cosmic Web from galaxy surveys. Applying our technique to galaxy and absorption-line surveys of the local Universe, we demonstrate that the bulk of the {IGM} indeed resides in the Cosmic Web. From the outskirts of Cosmic Web filaments, at approximately the cosmic mean matter density (rho\_m) and approx. 5 virial radii from nearby galaxies, we detect an increasing H I absorption signature towards higher densities and the circumgalactic medium, to approx. 200 rho\_m. However, the absorption is suppressed within the densest environments, suggesting shock-heating and ionization deep within filaments and/or feedback processes within galaxies.},

	title = {X-ray Emission From Hot Gas in Galaxy Groups and Clusters in Simba},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04115},
	abstract = {We examine X-ray scaling relations for massive halos (\$M\_\{500\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{12.3\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) in the Simba galaxy formation simulation. The X-ray weighted luminosity, \$L\_X\$ vs. \$M\_\{500\}\$ has power-law slopes \${\textbackslash}approx{\textbackslash}frac\{5\}\{3\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}approx{\textbackslash}frac\{8\}\{3\}\$ above and below \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13.5\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, deviating from the self-similarity increasingly to low masses. \$T\_X-M\_\{500\}\$ is self-similar above this mass, and slightly shallower below it. Comparing Simba to observed \$T\_X\$ scalings, we find that \$L\_X\$, \$L\_X\$-weighted [Fe/H], and entropies at \$0.1 R\_\{200\}\$ (\$S\_\{0.1\}\$) and \$R\_\{500\}\$ (\$S\_\{500\}\$) all match reasonably well. \$S\_\{500\}-T\_X\$ is consistent with self-similar expectations, but \$S\_\{0.1\}-T\_X\$ is shallower at lower \$T\_X\$, suggesting the dominant form of heating moves from gravitational shocks in the outskirts to non-gravitational feedback in the cores of smaller groups. Simba matches observations of \$L\_X\$ versus central galaxy stellar mass \$M\_*\$, predicting the additional trend that star-forming galaxies have higher \$L\_X(M\_*)\$. The electron density profiles for \$M\_\{500\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ halos show a \${\textbackslash}sim 0.1R\_\{200\}\$ core, but at lower masses the profiles are flat at all radii. \$T\_X\$ profiles are flat for \$M\_\{500\}{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, and increasingly centrally peaked with mass. The resulting entropy profiles are centrally depressed for the highest and lowest mass halos but flatter for intermediate-mass halos, with \$S\_\{{\textbackslash}rm core\}{\textbackslash}approx200-400\$ {keV} cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$. Simba's [Fe/H] profile matches observations in the core but over-predicts at larger radii, suggesting overly widespread metal distribution. We show that Simba's bipolar jet {AGN} feedback is most responsible for increasingly evacuating lower-mass halos, thereby suppressing core densities and raising core entropies to improve agreement with X-ray scaling relations.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03368},
	abstract = {Galactic outflows driven by stellar feedback are crucial for explaining the inefficiency of galaxy formation. Although strong feedback can promote the formation of galactic discs by limiting star formation at early times and removing low angular momentum gas, it is not understood how the same feedback can result in diverse objects such as elliptical galaxies or razor thin spiral galaxies. In this work, we investigate this problem using cosmological zoom-in simulations of two galaxies forming within \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ halos with almost identical mass accretion histories. At \$z{\textgreater}1.5\$, the two galaxies feature a surface density of star formation \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}{\textbackslash}simeq 10{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm kpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, leading to strong outflows. After the last starburst episode, both galaxies feature a dramatic gaseous disc growth from 1 kpc to 5 kpc during 1 Gyr, a decisive epoch we dub "the Grand Twirl". After this episode, the evolutionary tracks diverge, with one galaxy ending up as a bulge-dominated galaxy, whereas the other ends up as a disc-dominated galaxy. The origins of this dichotomy are the angular momentum of the accreted gas, and whether it adds constructively to the initial disc angular momentum. The build-up of this extended disc leads to a rapid lowering of \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\}\$ by over two orders of magnitude with \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {SFR}\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.1{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm kpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, in remarkable agreement with what is derived from Milky Way stellar populations in the solar neighbourhood. As a consequence, supernovae explosions are spread out and cannot launch galactic outflows anymore, allowing for the persistence of a thin, gently star forming, extended disc.},

	abstract = {We present an analytic toy model for the radiation produced by the interaction between the cold streams thought to feed massive halos at high redshift and their hot {CGM}. We begin by deriving cosmologically motivated parameters for the streams as they enter the halo virial radius, \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm v\}\$, as a function of halo mass and redshift. For \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ halos at \$z=2\$, we find the Hydrogen number density in streams to be \$n\_\{{\textbackslash}rm H,s\}{\textbackslash}sim (0.1-5){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\{{\textbackslash}rm cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, a factor of \${\textbackslash}delta {\textbackslash}sim (30-300)\$ times denser than the hot {CGM} density, while the stream radii are in the range \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}{\textbackslash}sim (0.03-0.50)R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm v\}\$. As the streams accelerate towards the halo centre, they become denser and narrower. The stream-{CGM} interaction induces Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability ({KHI}), which leads to entrainment of {CGM} mass by the stream and therefore to stream deceleration by momentum conservation. Assuming that the entrainment rates derived by Mandelker et al. 2019 in the absence of gravity can be applied locally at each halocentric radius, we derive equations of motion for the stream in the halo. Using these, we derive the net acceleration, mass growth, and energy dissipation induced by the stream-{CGM} interaction, as a function of halo mass and redshift, for different {CGM} density profiles. For the range of model parameters considered, we find that the interaction can induce dissipation luminosities \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm diss\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{42\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm erg{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ within \${\textbackslash}le 0.6 R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm v\}\$ of halos with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm v\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at \$z=2\$, with the emission scaling with halo mass and redshift approximately as \${\textbackslash}propto M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm v\}{\textbackslash},(1+z){\textasciicircum}2\$. The magnitude and spatial extent of the emission produced in massive halos at high redshift is consistent with observed Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ blobs, though better treatment of the {UV} background and self-shielding is needed to solidify this conclusion.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02146},
	abstract = {We constrain the temporal power spectrum of the {sSFR}(t) of star-forming galaxies, using a well-defined sample of Main Sequence galaxies from {MaNGA} and our earlier measurements of the ratio of the {SFR} averaged within the last 5 Myr to that averaged over the last 800 Myr. We explore the assumptions of stationarity and ergodicity that are implicit in this approach. We assume a single power-law form of the {PSD} but introduce an additional free parameter, the "intrinsic scatter", to try to account for any non-ergodicity introduced from various sources. We analyze both an "integrated" sample consisting of global measurements of all of the galaxies, and also 25 sub-samples obtained by considering five radial regions and five bins of integrated stellar mass. Assuming that any intrinsic scatter is not the dominant contribution to the Main Sequence dispersion of galaxies, we find that the {PSDs} have slopes between 1.0 and 2.0, indicating that the power (per log interval of frequency) is mostly contributed by longer timescale variations. We find a correlation between the returned {PSDs} and the inferred gas depletion times (\${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm dep,eff\}\$) obtained from application of the extended Schmidt Law, in that regions with shorter gas depletion times show larger integrated power and flatter {PSD}. Intriguingly, it is found that shifting the {PSDs} by the inferred \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm dep,eff\}\$ causes all of the 25 {PSDs} to closely overlap, at least in that region where the {PSD} is best constrained and least affected by uncertainties about any intrinsic scatter. A possible explanation of these results is the dynamical response of the gas regulator system of Lilly et al. 2013 to a uniform time-varying inflow, as previously proposed in Wang et al. 2019.},

	abstract = {The ages and metallicities of globular clusters ({GCs}) are known to be powerful tracers of the properties of their progenitor galaxies, enabling their use in determining the merger histories of galaxies. However, while useful in separating {GCs} into individual accretion events, the orbits of {GC} groups themselves have received less attention as probes of their progenitor galaxy properties. In this work, we use simulations of galaxies and their {GC} systems from the E-{MOSAICS} project to explore how the present-day orbital properties of {GCs} are related to the properties of their progenitor galaxies. We find that the orbits of {GCs} deposited by accretion events are sensitive to the mass and merger redshift of the satellite galaxy. Earlier mergers and larger galaxy masses deposit {GCs} at smaller median apocentres and lower total orbital energy. The orbital properties of accreted groups of {GCs} can therefore be used to infer the properties of their progenitor galaxy, though there exists a degeneracy between galaxy mass and accretion time. Combining {GC} orbits with other tracers ({GC} ages, metallicities) will help to break the galaxy mass/accretion time degeneracy, enabling stronger constraints on the properties of their progenitor galaxy. In situ {GCs} generally orbit at lower energies (small apocentres) than accreted {GCs}, however they exhibit a large tail to high energies and even retrograde orbits (relative to the present-day disc), showing significant overlap with accreted {GCs}. Applying the results to Milky Way {GCs} groups suggests a merger redshift \$z {\textbackslash}sim 1.5\$ for the Gaia Sausage/Enceladus and \$z{\textgreater}2\$ for the `low-energy'/Kraken group, adding further evidence that the Milky Way had two significant mergers in its past.},

	abstract = {Radiative cooling is central to a wide range of astrophysical problems. Despite its importance, cooling rates are generally computed using very restrictive assumptions, such as collisional ionization equilibrium and solar relative abundances. We simultaneously relax both assumptions and investigate the effects of photoionization of heavy elements by the metagalactic ultraviolet ({UV})/X-ray background and of variations in relative abundances on the cooling rates of optically thin gas in ionization equilibrium. We find that photoionization by the metagalactic background radiation reduces the net cooling rates by up to an order of magnitude for gas densities and temperatures typical of the shock-heated intergalactic medium and proto-galaxies (104 K ≲ T ≲ 106 K, ρ/〈ρ〉 ≲ 100). In addition, photoionization changes the relative contributions of different elements to the cooling rates. We conclude that photoionization by both the ionizing background and heavy elements needs to be taken into account in order for the cooling rates to be correct to an order of magnitude. Moreover, if the rates need to be known to better than a factor of a few, then departures of the relative abundances from solar need to be taken into account. We propose a method to compute cooling rates on an element-by-element basis by interpolating pre-computed tables that take photoionization into account. We provide such tables for a popular model of the evolving {UV}/X-ray background radiation, computed using the photoionization package cloudy. © 2008 {RAS}.},

	abstract = {Recent observations of global velocity gradients across and along molecular filaments have been interpreted as signs of gas accreting onto and along these filaments, potentially feeding star-forming cores and proto-clusters. The behavior of velocity gradients in filaments, however, has not been studied in detail, particularly on small scales ({\textless} 0.1 pc). In this paper, we present {MUFASA}, an efficient, robust, and automatic method to fit ammonia lines with multiple velocity components, generalizable to other molecular species. We also present {CRISPy}, a Python package to identify filament spines in 3D images (e.g., position-position-velocity cubes), along with a complementary technique to sort fitted velocity components into velocity-coherent filaments. In {NGC} 1333, we find a wealth of velocity gradient structures on a beam-resolved scale of {\textasciitilde}0.05 pc. Interestingly, these local velocity gradients are not randomly oriented with respect to filament spines and their perpendicular, i.e., radial, component decreases in magnitude towards the spine for many filaments. Together with remarkably constant velocity gradients on larger scales along many filaments, these results suggest a scenario in which gas falling onto filaments is progressively damped and redirected to flow along these filaments.},

With the aim of investigating the impact of the local environment density and stellar mass on the measured {HI} asymmetries in future large {HI} surveys, we provide recommendations for the most meaningful measures of asymmetry for use in future analysis. After controlling for stellar mass, we find signs of statistically significant trends of increasing asymmetries with local density. The most significant trend we measure is for the normalised flipped spectrum residual (\$A\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{spec\}\}\$), with mean {LVHIS} and {VIVA} values of \$0.204{\textbackslash}pm0.011\$ and \$0.615{\textbackslash}pm0.068\$ at average weighted \$10{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{th\}\}\$ nearest-neighbour galaxy number densities of \${\textbackslash}log({\textbackslash}rho\_\{10\}/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\})=-1.64\$ and 0.88, respectively.

The high resolution (\${\textless} 5{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\}\$) across a relatively large domain (\$20{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$) allows us to capture the hydrodynamic mixing and dynamical interactions between the hot and cool (\$T {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}4{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\$) phases in the outflow, which in turn leads to direct evidence of a qualitatively new mechanism for cool gas acceleration in galactic winds. We show that mixing of momentum from the hot phase to the cool phase accelerates the cool gas to \$800{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ on kpc scales, with properties inconsistent with the physical models of ram pressure acceleration or with bulk cooling from the hot phase. The mixing process also affects the hot phase, modifying its radial profiles of temperature, density, and velocity from the expectations of radial supersonic flow. This mechanism provides a physical explanation for the high velocity, blue shifted, low ionization absorption lines often observed in the spectra of starburst and high redshift galaxies.},

	abstract = {We explore the possibility to systematically study the extended, hot gaseous halos of low-redshift galaxies with Coronal Broad Ly alpha Absorbers ({CBLAs}). These are weak, thermally broadenend {HI} absorption lines arising from the tiny fraction of neutral hydrogen that resides in the collisionally ionized, million-degree halo gas in these galaxies. Using a semi-analytic approach, we model the spatial density and temperature distribution of hot coronal gas to predict strength, spectral shape, and cross section of {CBLAs} as a function of galaxy-halo mass and line-of-sight impact parameter. For virial halo masses in the range log (M/M\_sun)=10.6-12.6, the characteristic logarithmic {CBLA} {HI} column densities and Doppler parameters are log N({HI})=12.4-13.4 and b({HI})=70-200 km/s, indicating that {CBLAs} represent weak, shallow spectral features that are difficult to detect. Yet, the expected number density of {CBLAs} per unit redshift in the above given mass range is {dN}/dz({CBLA}){\textasciitilde}3, implying that {CBLAs} have a substantial absorption cross-section. We compare the model predictions with a combined set of ultraviolet ({UV}) absorption-line spectra from {HST}/{COS} and {HST}/{STIS} that trace the halos of four low-redshift galaxies. We demonstrate that {CBLAs} already might have been detected in these spectra, but the complex multi-component structure and the limited signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) complicate the interpretation of these {CBLA} candidate systems. Our study suggests that {CBLAs} represent a very interesting absorber class that potentially will allow us to further explore the hot coronae of galaxies with {UV} spectral data.},

	abstract = {Recent studies of neutral atomic hydrogen ({HI}) in nearby galaxies found that all field disk galaxies are {HI} saturated, in that they carry roughly as much {HI} as permitted before this gas becomes gravitationally unstable. By taking this {HI} saturation for granted, the atomic gas fraction \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm atm\}\$ of galactic disks can be predicted as a function of the stability parameter \$q=j{\textbackslash}sigma/({GM})\$, where \$M\$ and \$j\$ are the baryonic mass and specific angular momentum of the disk and \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ is the {HI} velocity dispersion Obreschkow et al. 2016. The log-ratio \${\textbackslash}Delta f\_q\$ between this predictor and the observed atomic fraction can be seen as a physically motivated `{HI} deficiency'. While field disk galaxies have \${\textbackslash}Delta f\_q {\textbackslash}approx0\$, objects subject to environmental removal of {HI} are expected to have \${\textbackslash}Delta f\_q{\textgreater}0\$. Within this framework, we revisit the {HI} deficiencies of satellite galaxies in the Virgo cluster and in clusters of the {EAGLE} simulation. We find that observed and simulated cluster galaxies are {HI} deficient and that \${\textbackslash}Delta f\_q\$ slightly increases when getting closer to the cluster centres. The \${\textbackslash}Delta f\_q\$ values are similar to traditional {HI} deficiency estimators, but \${\textbackslash}Delta f\_q\$ is more directly comparable between observations and simulations than morphology-based deficiency estimators. By tracking the simulated {HI} deficient cluster galaxies back in time, we confirm that \${\textbackslash}Delta f\_q{\textbackslash}approx0\$ until the galaxies first enter a halo with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$, at which moment they quickly lose {HI} by environmental effects. Finally, we use the simulation to investigate the links between \${\textbackslash}Delta f\_q\$ and quenching of star formation.},

	abstract = {We study the atomic gas content and the central stellar mass concentration for a sample of almost 1500 nearby galaxies to investigate the nature of starbursts and the influence of galaxy-galaxy interactions on star formation. We use the catalogue on interacting and merging galaxies in the S\${\textasciicircum}4\$G survey of Knapen et al.

We trace the central stellar mass concentration from the inner slope of the stellar component of the rotation curves, \$d\_\{{\textbackslash}rm R\}v\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}(0)\$. Starbursts - defined as galaxies with a factor \${\textgreater}4\$ enhanced {SFR} relative to a control sample (\${\textbackslash}pm 0.2\$ dex in stellar mass, \${\textbackslash}pm 1\$ in \$T\$-type, non-interacting) - are mainly early-type (\$T{\textbackslash}lesssim 5\$) massive spiral galaxies (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$), not necessarily interacting. For a given stellar mass bin, starbursts are characterised by lower gas depletion times, similar gas fractions, and larger central stellar mass concentrations than non-starburst galaxies. The global distributions of gas fraction and gas depletion time are not statistically different for interacting and non-interacting galaxies. However, in the case of currently merging galaxies, the median gas depletion time is a factor of \$0.4 {\textbackslash}pm 0.2\$ that of control sample galaxies, and their star formation rates are a factor of \$1.9 {\textbackslash}pm 0.5\$ enhanced, even though the median gas fraction is similar. Starbursts present long-lasting star formation in the circumnuclear regions that causes an enhancement of the central stellar density at \$z{\textbackslash}approx0\$ in both interacting and non-interacting systems. Starbursts have low gas depletion timescales, yet similar gas fractions as normal main-sequence galaxies. Galaxy mergers cause a moderate enhancement of the star formation efficiency (Abridged).},

	abstract = {We present the first results from our {CGM} at Cosmic Noon with {KCWI} program to study gas flows in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) at \$z=2-3\$. Combining the power of a high-resolution {VLT}/{UVES} quasar spectrum, an {HST}/{ACS} image, and integral field spectroscopy with Keck/{KCWI}, we detected Lya emission from a \$3.7L\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}\$ galaxy at \$z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gal\}=2.0711\$ associated with a Lyman limit system with weak {MgII} (\$W\_r(2796)=0.24\$ Ang) in quasar field J143040\$+\$014939. The galaxy is best modeled as a star-forming ({SFR}\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {FUV}\}=37.8\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) clumpy edge-on disk (\$i=85{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$). The background quasar probes the galaxy at an impact parameter of \$D=66\$ kpc along the projected galaxy minor axis (\${\textbackslash}Phi=89{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$). From photoionization modeling of the absorption system, which includes Lya, {MgII}, {SiII}, {SiIII}, {SiIV}, and {CIV}, we infer a total line-of-sight {CGM} metallicity of \$\{{\textbackslash}rm [Si/H]\}=-1.5{\textasciicircum}\{+0.4\}\_\{-0.3\}\$. The absorption system is roughly kinematically symmetric about the galaxy redshift, with a full {MgII} velocity spread of \${\textbackslash}sim210\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Given the galaxy--quasar orientation, {CGM} metallicity, and gas kinematics, we interpret this gas as outflowing from the host galaxy. By modeling the absorption as a polar outflow cone, we find the gas is decelerating with radial velocity \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm out\}=100-350\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for half opening angles of \${\textbackslash}theta\_0=20{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}-80{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$. Assuming a constant \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm out\}\$, it would take \${\textbackslash}sim190-650\$ Myr for the gas to reach 66 kpc. The outflow is energetic, with a mass outflow rate of \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm out\}=45-51\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and mass loading factor of \${\textbackslash}eta{\textbackslash}sim1.3\$. We aim to build a sample of \${\textbackslash}sim50\$ {MgII} absorber--galaxy pairs at this epoch to better understand gas flows when they are most actively building galaxies.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07831},
	abstract = {Studies measuring the chemical abundances of the neutral gas in star-forming galaxies ({SFGs}) require ionization correction factors ({ICFs}) to accurately measure their metal contents. In the work presented here we calculate newly improved {ICFs} for a sample of {SFGs}. These new corrections include both the contaminating ionized gas along the line of sight ({ICF}\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ionized\}\$) and unaccounted higher ionization stages in the neutral gas ({ICF}\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm neutral\}\$). We make use of recently acquired spectroscopic observations taken with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph ({COS}) on board Hubble to measure column densities for Fe {II} and Fe {III}. Using the Fe {III}/Fe {II} ratios as well as other physical properties (i.e. \${\textbackslash}log\$[L\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {UV}\}\$], \$N\$(H I), T, and \$Z\$) we generate ad-hoc photoionization models with {CLOUDY} to quantify the corrections required for each of the targets. We identify a luminosity threshold of \${\textbackslash}log\$[L\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {UV}\}\$]\${\textbackslash}sim\$ 40.75 erg s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ above which the {ICF}\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm neutral\}\$ values for nitrogen are relatively higher ({ICF}\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm neutral\}=0.05\$-0.7) than those for the rest of the elements ({ICF}\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm neutral\}{\textbackslash}sim 0.01\$). This behavior indicates that for the high {UV} luminosity objects, N {II} is found in non-negligible quantities in the neutral gas, making these {ICF}\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm neutral\}\$ corrections critical for determining the true abundances in the interstellar medium. In addition, we calculate {ICFs} from a uniform grid of models covering a wide range of physical properties typically observed in studies of {SFGs} and extragalactic H {II} regions. We provide the community with tabulated {ICF} values for the neutral gas abundances measured from a variety of environments and applicable to chemical studies of the high redshift universe.},

Our large sample provides an unparalleled look at the physical conditions and distribution of metals in the {CGM} of a single galaxy using ions that probe a wide range of gas phases (Si {II}, Si {III}, Si {IV}, C {II}, C {IV}, and O {VI}, the latter being from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer). We find that Si {III} and O {VI} have near unity covering factor maintained all the way out to 1.2Rvir and 1.9Rvir, respectively. We show that Si {III} is the dominant ion over Si {II} and Si {IV} at any R. While we do not find that the properties of the {CGM} of M31 depend strongly on the azimuth, we show that they change remarkably around 0.3-0.5Rvir, conveying that the inner regions of the {CGM} of M31 are more dynamic and have more complicated multi-phase gas-structures than at R{\textgreater}0.5Rvir. We estimate the metal mass of the {CGM} within Rvir as probed by Si {II}, Si {III}, and Si {IV} is 2x10{\textasciicircum}7 Msun and by O {VI} is {\textgreater}8x10{\textasciicircum}7 Msun, while the baryon mass of the 10{\textasciicircum}4-10{\textasciicircum}5.5 K gas is {\textasciitilde}4x10{\textasciicircum}10 (Z/0.3 Zsun){\textasciicircum}(-1) Msun within Rvir. We show that different zoom-in cosmological simulations of L* galaxies better reproduce the column density profile of O {VI} with R than Si {III} or the other studied ions. We find that observations of the M31 {CGM} and zoom-in simulations of L* galaxies have both lower ions showing higher column density dispersion and dependence on R than higher ions, indicating that the higher ionization structures are larger and/or more broadly distributed.},

	abstract = {The microphysics of {\textasciitilde}{GeV} cosmic ray ({CR}) transport on galactic scales remain deeply uncertain, with almost all studies adopting simple prescriptions (e.g. constant-diffusivity). We explore different physically-motivated, anisotropic, dynamical {CR} transport scalings in high-resolution cosmological {FIRE} simulations of dwarf and {\textasciitilde}\$L\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}\$ galaxies where scattering rates vary with local plasma properties motivated by extrinsic turbulence ({ET}) or self-confinement ({SC}) scenarios, with varying assumptions about e.g. turbulent power spectra on un-resolved scales, Alfven-wave damping, etc. We self-consistently predict observables including \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-rays (\$L\_\{{\textbackslash}gamma\}\$), grammage, residence times, and {CR} energy densities to constrain the models. We demonstrate many non-linear dynamical effects (not captured in simpler models) tend to enhance confinement. For example, in multi-phase media, even allowing arbitrary fast transport in neutral gas does not substantially reduce {CR} residence times (or \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}gamma\}\$), as transport is rate-limited by the ionized {WIM} and 'inner {CGM}' gaseous halo (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{4\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}\$ K gas within 10-30 kpc), and \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}gamma\}\$ can be dominated by trapping in small 'patches.' Most physical {ET} models contribute negligible scattering of {\textasciitilde}1-10 {GeV} {CRs}, but it is crucial to account for anisotropy and damping (especially of fast modes) or else scattering rates would violate observations. We show that the most widely-assumed scalings for {SC} models produce excessive confinement by factors {\textgreater}100 in the {WIM} and inner {CGM}, where turbulent and Landau damping dominate. This suggests either a breakdown of quasi-linear theory used to derive the {CR} transport parameters in {SC}, or that other novel damping mechanisms dominate in intermediate-density ionized gas.},

	abstract = {We measured gas-phase metallicity, ionisation parameter and dust extinction for 1795 representative local star-forming galaxies using integral field spectroscopy from the {SDSS}-{IV} {MaNGA} survey. We self-consistently derive these quantities by comparing observed line fluxes with photoionisation models using a Bayesian framework. We also present the first comprehensive study of the [{SIII}]\${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}lambda\$9069,9532 nebular lines, which have long been predicted to be ideal tracers of the ionisation parameter. Unfortunately, we find that current photoionisation models substantially over-predict [{SIII}] lines intensity, while broadly reproducing other observed optical line ratios. We discuss how to nonetheless make use of the information provided by [{SIII}] lines by setting a prior on the ionisation parameter. Following this approach, we derive spatially-resolved maps and radial profiles of metallicity and ionisation parameter. The metallicity radial profiles are comparable with previous works, with metallicity declining toward the outer parts and a flattening in the central regions, in agreement with infall models of galaxy formation, that predict that spiral discs build up through accretion of material, which leads to an inside-out growth. On the other hand, ionisation parameter radial profiles are flat for low-mass galaxies, while their slope becomes positive as galaxy mass increases. However, the ionisation parameter maps we obtain are clumpy, especially for low-mass galaxies. Ionisation parameter is tightly correlated with the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ equivalent width [{EW}(H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$)], following a nearly universal relation, which we attribute to the change of the spectral shape of ionising sources due to ageing of {HII} regions. We derive a positive correlation between ionisation parameter and metallicity at fixed {EW}(H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$), in disagreement with previous theoretical works expecting an anti-correlation.},

Here we present an analysis of 405 high mass (log M\$\_\{*\}\$/M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textbackslash}geqslant10\$), star-forming galaxies (excluding {AGN}) with low inclinations at \$z{\textbackslash}sim\$0, using stacking techniques of the {NaD} \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}lambda\$5889,5895 A neutral gas tracer in {IFU} observations from the {MaNGA} {DR}15 survey. We detect outflows in the central regions of 78/405 galaxies and determine their extent and power through the construction of stacked annuli. We find outflows are most powerful in central regions and extend out to \${\textbackslash}sim\$1R\$\_\{e\}\$, with declining mass outflow rates and loading factors as a function of radius. The stacking of spaxels over key galaxy quantities reveals outflow detections in regions of high \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{{SFR}\}\}\$ (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$0.01 M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$) and \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{M\_\{*\}\}\$ (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$10\${\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$) along the resolved main sequence.

Furthermore, measurements of the H\${\textbackslash}delta\$ and D\$\_\{n\}\$4000 indices reveal virtually identical star formation histories between galaxies with outflows and those without. Finally, through stacking of {HI} 21 cm observations for a subset of our sample, we find outflow galaxies show reduced {HI} gas fractions at central velocities compared to their non-detection control counterparts, suggestive of some removal of {HI} gas, likely in the central regions of the galaxies, but not enough to completely quench the host.},

We also constrain the {HI} and {HI}+H2 mass functions using the {xGASS} survey, and compare it to the {HI} mass function from the {ALFALFA} survey. We find the cosmic abundance of molecular gas in the local Universe to be Omega\_H2=(5.34+/-0.47)x10{\textasciicircum}-5 h{\textasciicircum}-1.

We first confirm that both simulated and observed galaxies are consistently distributed in phase space. We then hypothesize that the {TSI} and {SFR} are causally connected; thus, both the {TSI} and {SFR} of galaxies at each position of phase space can be associated through abundance matching. Using a flexible model, we derive the star formation history ({SFH}) of cluster galaxies that best reproduces the relationship between the {TSI} and {SFR} at \$z{\textbackslash}sim 0.08\$. According to this {SFH}, we find that the galaxies with \$M\_\{*\} {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ generally follow the so-called "delayed-then-rapid" quenching pattern. Our main results are as following: (i) Part of the quenching takes place outside clusters through mass quenching and pre-processing. The e-folding timescale of this "\$ex{\textbackslash}text\{-\}situ\$ quenching phase" is roughly 3 Gyr with a strong inverse mass dependence. (ii) The pace of quenching is maintained roughly for 2 Gyr ("delay time") during the first crossing time into the cluster. During the delay time, quenching remains gentle probably because gas loss happens primarily on hot and neutral gases. (iii) Quenching becomes more dramatic (e-folding timescale of roughly 1 Gyr) after delay time, probably because ram pressure stripping is strongest near the cluster center. Counter-intuitively, more massive galaxies show shorter quenching timescales mainly because they enter their clusters with lower gas fractions due to \$ex{\textbackslash}text\{-\}situ\$ quenching.},

	abstract = {Young neutron stars ({NSs}) born in core-collapse explosions are promising candidates for the central engines of fast radio bursts ({FRBs}), since the first localized repeating burst {FRB} 121102 happens in a star forming dwarf galaxy, which is similar to the host galaxies of superluminous supernovae ({SLSNe}) and long gamma-ray bursts ({LGRBs}). However, {FRB} 180924 and {FRB} 190523 are localized to massive galaxies with low rates of star formation, compared with the host of {FRB} 121102. Meanwhile, the offsets between the bursts and host centers are about 4 kpc and 29 kpc for {FRB} 180924 and {FRB} 190523, respectively. These properties of hosts are similar to short gamma-ray bursts {\textbackslash}textbf\{({SGRBs})\}, which are produced by mergers of binary neutron star ({BNS}) or neutron star-black hole ({NS}-{BH}). Therefore, the {NSs} powering {FRBs} may be formed in {BNS} mergers. In this paper, we study the {BNS} merger rates, merger times, and predict their most likely merger locations for different types of host galaxies using population synthesis method. We find that the {BNS} merger channel is consistent with the recently reported offsets of {FRB} 180924 and {FRB} 190523. The offset distribution of short {GRBs} is well reproduced by population synthesis using galaxy model which is similar to {GRB} hosts. The event rate of {FRBs} (including non-repeating and repeating), is larger than those of {BNS} merger and short {GRBs}, which requires a large fraction of observed {FRBs} emitting several bursts. Using curvature radiation by bunches in {NS} magnetospheres, we also predict the observational properties of {FRBs} from {BNS} mergers, including the dispersion measure, and rotation measure. At late times (\$t{\textbackslash}geq1\$yr), the contribution to dispersion measure and rotation measure from {BNS} merger ejecta could be neglected.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02467},
	abstract = {The intergalactic medium is expected to clump on scales down to \$10{\textasciicircum}4-10{\textasciicircum}8\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ before the onset of reionization. The impact of these small-scale structures on reionization is poorly understood despite the modern understanding that gas clumpiness limits the growth of H {II} regions. We use a suite of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that capture the \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ Jeans mass of unheated gas to study density fluctuations during reionization. Our simulations track the complex ionization and hydrodynamical response of gas in the wake of ionization fronts. The clumping factor of ionized gas (proportional to the recombination rate) rises to a peak value of \$5-20\$ approximately \${\textbackslash}Delta t = 10\$ Myr after ionization front passage, depending on the incident intensity, redshift, and degree to which the gas had been pre-heated by the first X-ray sources. The clumping factor reaches its relaxed value of \${\textbackslash}approx 3\$ by \${\textbackslash}Delta t = 300\$ Myr. The mean free path of Lyman-limit photons evolves in unison, being up to several times shorter in un-relaxed, recently reionized regions compared to those that were reionized much earlier. Assessing the impact of this response on the global reionizaton process, we find that un-relaxed gaseous structures boost the total number of recombinations by \${\textbackslash}approx 50\$ \% and lead to spatial fluctuations in the mean free path that persist appreciably for several hundred million years after the completion of reionization.},

	abstract = {We present results from seventy-one zoom simulations of a Milky Way-sized ({MW}) halo, exploring the parameter space for a widely-used star formation and feedback model in the \{{\textbackslash}tt Enzo\} simulation code. We propose a novel way to match observations, using functional fits to the observed baryon makeup over a wide range of halo masses. The model {MW} galaxy is calibrated using three parameters: the star formation efficiency \${\textbackslash}left(f\_*{\textbackslash}right)\$, the efficiency of thermal energy from stellar feedback \${\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}epsilon{\textbackslash}right)\$ and the region into which feedback is injected \${\textbackslash}left(r{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm and\}{\textbackslash} s{\textbackslash}right)\$. We find that changing the amount of feedback energy affects the baryon content most significantly. We then identify two sets of feedback parameter values that are both able to reproduce the baryonic properties for haloes between \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. We can potentially improve the agreement by incorporating more parameters or physics. If we choose to focus on one property at a time, we can obtain a more realistic halo baryon makeup. We show that the employed feedback prescription is insensitive to dark matter mass resolution between \$10{\textasciicircum}5{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}7{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. Contrasting both star formation criteria and the corresponding combination of optimal feedback parameters, we also highlight that feedback is self-consistent: to match the same baryonic properties, with a relatively higher gas to stars conversion efficiency, the feedback strength required is lower, and vice versa. Lastly, we demonstrate that chaotic variance in the code can cause deviations of approximately 10{\textbackslash}\% and 25{\textbackslash}\% in the stellar and baryon mass in simulations evolved from identical initial conditions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02454},
	abstract = {Galactic-scale winds driven by active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) are often invoked to suppress star formation in galaxy evolution models, but the mechanisms driving these outflows are hotly debated. Two key {AGN} feedback models are (1) radiation pressure accelerating cool gas and (2) a hot outflowing wind entraining the {ISM}. Highly ionized emission-line diagnostics represent a powerful means of differentiating these scenarios because of their sensitivity to the expected compression of the {ISM} clouds by the hot wind. Here, we report the first spatially resolved {UV} emission spectroscopy of a prototypical (radio-quiet) quasar-driven superwind around the obscured quasar {SDSSJ}1356+1026 at z=0.123. We observe ratios of {OVI}/{CIV}, {NV}/{CIV}, and {CIV}/{HeII} that are remarkably similar for outflowing gas clouds {\textless}100 pc and {\textasciitilde}10 kpc from the nucleus. Such similarity is expected for clouds with {AGN} radiation pressure dominated dynamics. Comparing the observed line emission to models of clouds in balance with radiation pressure and/or a hot wind, we rule out the presence of a dynamically important hot wind and constrain the ratio of hot gas pressure to radiation pressure to P\_hot/P\_rad{\textless}0.25 both at {\textless}100 pc and {\textasciitilde}10 kpc from the nucleus. Moreover, the predictions of the radiation pressure confined cloud models that best fit observed {UV} line ratios are consistent with the observed diffuse X-ray spectrum. These results indicate that this {AGN} superwind is driven by radiation pressure or was driven by a hot wind that has since dissipated despite on-going {AGN} activity.},

	abstract = {We study the effects of cosmic rays ({CRs}) on outflows from star-forming galaxies in the circum and inter-galactic medium ({CGM}/{IGM}), in high-resolution, fully-cosmological {FIRE}-2 simulations (accounting for mechanical and radiative stellar feedback, magnetic fields, anisotropic conduction/viscosity/{CR} diffusion and streaming, and {CR} losses). We showed previously that massive (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$), low-redshift (\$z{\textbackslash}lesssim 1-2\$) halos can have {CR} pressure dominate over thermal {CGM} pressure and balance gravity, giving rise to a cooler {CGM} with an equilibrium density profile. This dramatically alters outflows. Absent {CRs}, high gas thermal pressure in massive halos "traps" galactic outflows near the disk, so they recycle. With {CRs} injected in supernovae as modeled here, the low-pressure halo allows "escape" and {CR} pressure gradients continuously accelerate this material well into the {IGM} in "fast" outflows, while lower-density gas at large radii is accelerated in-situ into "slow" outflows that extend to \${\textgreater}\$Mpc scales. {CGM}/{IGM} outflow morphologies are radically altered: they become mostly volume-filling (with inflow in a thin mid-plane layer) and coherently biconical from the disk to \${\textgreater}\$Mpc. The {CR}-driven outflows are primarily cool (\$T{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{5\}{\textbackslash},\$K) and low-velocity. All of these effects weaken and eventually vanish at lower halo masses (\${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) or higher redshifts (\$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim 1-2\$), reflecting the ratio of {CR} to thermal+gravitational pressure in the outer halo. We present a simple analytic model which explains all of the above phenomena.},

	abstract = {Winds driven by stellar feedback are an essential part of the galactic ecosystem and are the main mechanism through which low-mass galaxies regulate their star formation. These winds are generally observed to be multi-phase with detections of entrained neutral and molecular gas. They are also thought to enrich the circum-galactic medium around galaxies with metals and dust. This ejected dust encodes information about the integrated star formation and outflow history of the galaxy. It is therefore, important to understand how much dust is entrained and driven out of the disc by galactic winds. Here we demonstrate that stellar feedback is efficient in driving dust-enriched winds and eject enough material to account for the amount of extraplanar dust observed in nearby galaxies. The amount of dust in the wind depends on the sites from where they are launched, with dustier galaxies launching more dust enriched outflows. Moreover, the outflowing cold-dense gas is significantly more dust-enriched than the volume filling hot tenuous material, naturally reproducing the complex multiphase structure of the outflowing wind observed in nearby galaxies. These results provide an important new insight into the dynamics, structure, and composition of galactic winds and their role in determining the dust content of the extragalactic gas in galaxies.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00959},
	abstract = {We investigate the connection between galaxy--galaxy mergers and enhanced black hole ({BH}) growth using the cosmological hydrodynamical {\textbackslash}eagle simulation. We do this via three methods of analysis, investigating: the merger fraction of {AGN}, the {AGN} fraction of merging systems and the {AGN} fraction of galaxies with close companions. In each case, we find an increased abundance of {AGN} within merging systems relative to control samples of inactive or isolated galaxies (by up to a factor of \${\textbackslash}approx 4\$ depending on the analysis method used), confirming that mergers are enhancing {BH} accretion rates for at least a subset of the galaxy population. The greatest excess of {AGN} triggered via a merger are found in lower mass (\$M\_* {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\${\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}Msol) gas rich (\$f\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{gas\}\} {\textgreater} 0.1\$) central galaxies with lower mass {BHs} (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{BH}\}\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}\${\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}Msol) at lower redshifts (\$z{\textless}1\$). We find no enhancement of {AGN} triggered via mergers in more massive galaxies (\$M\_* {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\${\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}Msol). The enhancement of {AGN} is not uniform throughout the phases of a merger, and instead peaks within the early {\textbackslash}emph\{remnants\} of merging systems (typically lagging \${\textbackslash}approx 300\${\textasciitilde}Myr post-coalescence of the two galaxies at \$z=0.5\$). We argue that neither major (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{*,1\}\} / M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{*,2\}\} {\textbackslash}geq {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{4\}\$) nor minor mergers (\${\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{10\} {\textless} M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{*,1\}\} / M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{*,2\}\} {\textless} {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{4\}\$) are statistically relevant for enhancing {BH} masses globally. Whilst at all redshifts the galaxies experiencing a merger have accretion rates that are on average 2--3 times that of isolated galaxies, the majority of mass that is accreted onto {BHs} occurs outside the periods of a merger. We compute that on average no more than 15{\textbackslash}\% of a {BHs} final day mass comes from the enhanced accretion rates triggered via a merger.},

	abstract = {Understanding the evolution of self-gravitating, isothermal, magnetized gas is crucial for star formation, as these physical processes have been postulated to set the initial mass function ({IMF}). We present a suite of isothermal magnetohydrodynamic ({MHD}) simulations using the {GIZMO} code, that resolve the formation of individual stars in giant molecular clouds ({GMCs}), spanning a range of Mach numbers found in observed {GMCs}. As in past works, the mean and median stellar masses are sensitive to numerical resolution, because they are sensitive to low-mass stars that contribute a vanishing fraction of the overall stellar mass. The \{{\textbackslash}em mass-weighted\} median stellar mass \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{50\}\$ becomes insensitive to resolution once turbulent fragmentation is well-resolved. Without imposing Larson-like scaling laws, our simulations find \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{50\} {\textbackslash}propto M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{0\} {\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} {\textbackslash}alpha\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{turb\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{SFE}\}{\textasciicircum}\{1/3\}\$ for {GMC} mass \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{0\}\$, sonic Mach number \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\$, virial parameter \${\textbackslash}alpha\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{turb\}\$, and star formation efficiency \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{{SFE}\}=M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}star\}/M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{0\}\$. This fit agrees well with previous {IMF} results from the {RAMSES}, {ORION}2, and {SphNG} codes. Although \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{50\}\$ has no significant dependence on the magnetic field strength at the cloud scale, {MHD} is necessary to prevent a fragmentation cascade that results in non-convergent stellar masses. For initial conditions and {SFE} similar to star-forming {GMCs} in our Galaxy, we predict \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{50\}\$ to be \${\textgreater}20 M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, an order of magnitude larger than observed (\${\textbackslash}sim 2 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), together with an excess of brown dwarfs. Moreover, \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{50\}\$ is sensitive to initial cloud properties and evolves strongly in time within a given cloud, predicting much larger {IMF} variations than are observationally allowed. We conclude that physics beyond {MHD} turbulence and gravity are necessary ingredients for the {IMF}.},

We find that at high redshift (\$z {\textbackslash}gtrsim 4\$), galaxies acquire their cold gas (both atomic and molecular) mostly by accretion, with the fraction of cold gas reaching about 20\% of the cosmic baryon fraction. We find a strong dependence of the star formation rate on the H\$\_2\$ mass, suggesting a near-universal depletion timescale of 0.1-1 Gyr in Milky Way sized haloes (of masses \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} {\textbackslash} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at \$z = 0\$). We also find evidence for a near-universality of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation across redshifts, with very little dependence on stellar mass, if a constant conversion factor (\${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CO}\}\$) of {CO} luminosity to molecular gas mass is assumed. Combining the atomic and molecular gas observations with the stellar build-up illustrates that galactic mass assembly in Milky-Way sized haloes proceeds from smooth accretion at high redshifts, towards becoming merger-dominated at late times (\$z {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.6\$). Our results can be used to constrain numerical simulations of the dominant growth and accretion processes of galaxies over cosmic history.},

	abstract = {Theoretical and observational arguments suggest that there is a large amount of hot (\${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}6\$ K), diffuse gas residing in the Milky Way's halo, while its total mass and spatial distribution are still unclear. In this work, we present a general model for the gas density distribution in the Galactic halo, and investigate the gas evolution under radiative cooling with a series of 2D hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the mass inflow rate in the developed cooling flow increases with gas metallicity and the total gas mass in the halo. For a fixed halo gas mass, the spatial gas distribution affects the onset time of the cooling catastrophe, which starts earlier when the gas distribution is more centrally-peaked, but does not substantially affect the final mass inflow rate. The gravity from the Galactic bulge and disk affects gas properties in inner regions, but has little effect on the final inflow rate either. We confirm our results by investigating cooling flows in several density models adopted from the literature, including the Navarro-Frenk-White ({NFW}) model, the cored-{NFW} model, the Maller \& Bullock model, and the \${\textbackslash}beta\$ model. Typical mass inflow rates in our simulations range from \${\textbackslash}sim 5 M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ to \${\textbackslash}sim 60 M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, and are much higher than the observed star formation rate in our Galaxy, suggesting that stellar and active galactic nucleus feedback processes may play important roles in the evolution of the Milky Way ({MW}) and {MW}-type galaxies.},

	abstract = {Galaxies forming in low-mass halos are thought to be primarily responsible for reionizing the Universe during the first billion years after the Big Bang. Yet, these halos are extremely inefficient at forming stars in the nearby Universe. In this work, we address this apparent tension, and ask whether a physically motivated model of galaxy formation that reproduces the observed abundance of faint galaxies in the nearby Universe is also consistent with available observational constraints on the reionization history. By interfacing the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model for galaxy formation with an analytic reionization model, we constructed a computationally efficient pipeline that connects `ground-level' galaxy formation physics to `top-level' cosmological-scale observables. Based on photometric properties of the galaxy populations predicted up to \$z=15\$, we compute the reionization history of intergalactic hydrogen. We quantify the three degenerate quantities that influence the total ionizing photon budget, including the abundance of galaxies, the intrinsic production rate of ionizing photons, and the {LyC} escape fraction. We explore covariances between these quantities using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We find that our locally calibrated model is consistent with all currently available constraints on the reionization history, under reasonable assumptions about the {LyC} escape fraction. We quantify the fraction of ionizing photons contributed by galaxies of different luminosities and find that the galaxies expected to be detected in {JWST} {NIRCam} wide and deep surveys are responsible for producing \${\textbackslash}sim 40\$-\$80{\textbackslash}\%\$ of ionizing photons throughout the {EoR}.

	title = {Optically-Thin Spatially-Resolved Mg {II} Emission Maps the Escape of Ionizing Photons},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06059},
	abstract = {Early star-forming galaxies produced copious ionizing photons. A fraction of these photons escaped gas within galaxies to reionize the entire Universe. This escape fraction is crucial for determining how the Universe became reionized, but the neutral intergalactic medium precludes direct measurement of the escape fraction at high-redshifts. Indirect estimates of the escape fraction must describe how the Universe was reionized. Here, we present new Keck Cosmic Web Imager spatially-resolved spectroscopy of the resonant Mg {II} 2800 doublet from a redshift 0.36 galaxy, J1503+3644, with a previously observed escape fraction of 6\%. The Mg {II} emission has a similar spatial extent as the stellar continuum, and each of the Mg {II} doublet lines are well-fit by single Gaussians. The Mg {II} is optically thin. The intrinsic flux ratio of the red and blue Mg {II} emission line doublet, \$R = F\_\{2796\}/F\_\{2803\}\$, is set by atomic physics to be two, but Mg\${\textasciicircum}+\$ gas along the line of sight decreases \$R\$ proportional to the Mg {II} optical depth. Combined with the metallicity, \$R\$ estimates the neutral gas column density. The observed \$R\$ ranges across the galaxy from 0.8-2.7, implying a factor of 2 spatial variation of the relative escape fraction. All of the ionizing photons that escape J1503+3644 pass through regions of high \$R\$. We combine the Mg {II} emission and dust attenuation to accurately estimate the absolute escape fractions for ten local Lyman Continuum emitting galaxies and suggest that Mg {II} can predict escape fraction within the Epoch of Reionization.},

	title = {The Kinematics and Dark Matter Fractions of {TNG}50 Galaxies at z=2 from an Observational Perspective},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05486},
	abstract = {We contrast the kinematics and dark matter contents of \$z=2\$ star-forming galaxies ({SFGs}) from state-of-the art cosmological simulations within the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} framework to observations. To this end, we create realistic mock observations of massive {SFGs} (\$M\_*{\textgreater}4{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, {SFR} \${\textgreater}50{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) from the {TNG}50 simulation of the {IllustrisTNG} suite, resembling near-infrared, adaptive-optics assisted integral-field observations from the ground. Using observational line fitting and modeling techniques, we analyse in detail the kinematics of seven {TNG}50 galaxies from five different projections per galaxy, and compare them to observations of twelve massive {SFGs} by Genzel et al. (2020). The simulated galaxies show clear signs of disc rotation but mostly exhibit more asymmetric rotation curves, partly due to large intrinsic radial and vertical velocity components. At identical inclination angle, their one-dimensional velocity profiles can vary along different lines of sight by up to \${\textbackslash}Delta v=200\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. From dynamical modelling we infer rotation speeds and velocity dispersions that are in the ballpark of observational results. We find low central dark matter fractions compatible with observations (\$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {DM}\}{\textasciicircum}v({\textless}R\_e)=v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {DM}\}{\textasciicircum}2(R\_e)/v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm circ\}{\textasciicircum}2(R\_e){\textbackslash}sim0.29{\textbackslash}pm0.11\$), however for disc effective radii \$R\_e\$ that are too small: at fixed \$R\_e\$ the {TNG}50 dark matter fractions are too high by factors of \$1.5-5\$. We speculate that the differences in kinematics and dark matter content compared to the observations may be due to physical processes which are not resolved in sufficient detail with the numerical resolution available in current cosmological simulations.},

	title = {Constraints on precipitation-limited hot halos from massive galaxies to galaxy clusters},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04917},
	abstract = {We present constraints on a simple analytical model for hot diffuse halo gas, derived from a fit spanning two orders of magnitude in halo mass (\$M\_\{500\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{12.5\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{14.5\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$). The model is motivated by the observed prevalence of a precipitation limit, and its main free parameter is the central ratio of gas cooling timescale to free-fall timescale (\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$). Using stacked X-ray and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations of the environments around massive galaxies, galaxy groups and clusters, we obtain the best-fitting model parameters. We find \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\} {\textbackslash}sim 50-110\$, depending on the model extrapolation beyond the halo virial radius and possibly on biases present in the data-sets used in the fitting analysis. The model adequately describes the entire mass range, except for intermediate mass halos (\$M\_\{500\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{13.5\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) which systematically fall below the model predictions. However, the best fits for \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ substantially exceed the values typically derived from X-ray observations of individual systems (\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\} {\textbackslash}sim 10-30\$). We consider several explanations for those discrepancies, including X-ray selection biases and a potential anti-correlation between X-ray luminosity and the central galaxy's stellar mass.},

	title = {A model for the formation of stellar associations and clusters from giant molecular clouds},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04453},
	abstract = {We present a large suite of {MHD} simulations of turbulent, star-forming giant molecular clouds({GMCs}) with stellar feedback, extending previous work by simulating 10 different random realizations for each point in the parameter space of cloud mass and size. It is found that oncethe clouds disperse due to stellar feedback, both self-gravitating star clusters and unbound stars generally remain, which arise from the same underlying continuum of substructured stellar density, ie. the hierarchical cluster formation scenario. The fraction of stars that are born within gravitationally-bound star clusters is related to the overall cloud star formation efficiency set by stellar feedback, but has significant scatter due to stochastic variations in the small-scale details of the star-forming gas flow. We use our numerical results to calibrate a model for mapping the bulk properties (mass, size, and metallicity) of self-gravitating {GMCs} onto the star cluster populations they form, expressed statistically in terms of cloud-level distributions. Synthesizing cluster catalogues from an observed {GMC} catalogue in M83, we find that this model predicts initial star cluster masses and sizes that are in good agreement with observations, using only standard {IMF} and stellar evolution models as inputs for feedback. Within our model, the ratio of the strength of gravity to stellar feedback is the key parameter setting the masses of star clusters, and of the various feedback channels direct stellar radiation(photon momentum and photoionization) is the most important on {GMC} scales.},

	abstract = {We study the properties of 55 morphologically-identified merging galaxy systems at z{\textasciitilde}2. These systems are flagged as mergers based on features such as tidal tails, double nuclei, and asymmetry. Our sample is drawn from the {MOSFIRE} Deep Evolution Field ({MOSDEF}) survey, along with a control sample of isolated galaxies at the same redshift. We consider the relationships between stellar mass, star formation rate ({SFR}), and gas-phase metallicity for both merging and non-merging systems. In the local universe, merging systems are characterized by an elevated {SFR} and depressed metallicity compared to isolated systems at a given mass. Our results indicate {SFR} enhancement and metallicity deficit for merging systems relative to non-merging systems for a fixed stellar mass at z{\textasciitilde}2, though larger samples are required to establish these preliminary results with higher statistical significance. In future work, it will be important to establish if the enhanced {SFR} and depressed metallicity in high-redshift mergers deviate from the "fundamental metallicity relation," as is observed in mergers in the local universe, and therefore shed light on gas flows during galaxy interactions.},

	abstract = {Supersonically Induced Gas Objects ({SIGOs}) primarily form in the early Universe, outside of dark matter halos due to the presence of a relative stream velocity between baryons and dark matter. These structures may be the progenitors of globular clusters. Since {SIGOs} are made out of pristine gas, we investigate the effect of atomic cooling on their properties. We run a set of four simulations by using the moving-mesh code \{{\textbackslash}sc arepo\}, with and without baryon-dark matter relative velocity and with and without the effects of atomic cooling. We show that {SIGO}'s density, temperature, and prolateness are determined by gravitational interactions rather than cooling. The cold gas fraction in {SIGOs} is much higher than that of dark matter halos. Specifically, we show that the {SIGO}'s characteristic low temperature and extreme high gas density forges a nurturing site for the earliest star formation sites.},

	abstract = {Observations of the low-mass satellites in the Local Group have shown high fractions of gas-poor, quiescent galaxies relative to isolated dwarfs, implying that the host halo environment plays an important role in the quenching of dwarf galaxies. In this work, we present measurements of the quenched fractions and quenching timescales of dwarf satellite galaxies in the {DC} Justice League suite of 4 high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass halos. We show that these simulations accurately reproduce the satellite luminosity functions of observed nearby galaxies, as well as the variation in satellite quenched fractions from \$M\_* {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}5\$ solar masses to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ solar masses. We then trace the histories of satellite galaxies back to \$z {\textbackslash}sim 15\$, and find that many satellites with \$M\_* {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{6-8\}\$ solar masses quench within 2 Gyr of infall into the host halo, while others in the same mass range remain star-forming for as long as 5 Gyr. We show that this scatter can be explained by the satellite's gas mass and the ram pressure it feels at infall. Finally, we identify a characteristic stellar mass scale of \$10{\textasciicircum}8\$ solar masses above which infalling satellites are largely resistant to rapid environmental quenching.},

	abstract = {We present improved synthesis models of the evolving spectrum of the {UV}/X-ray diffuse background, updating and extending our previous results. Five new main components are added to our radiative transfer code {CUBA}: (1) the sawtooth modulation of the background intensity from resonant line absorption in the Lyman series of cosmic hydrogen and helium; (2) the X-ray emission from the obscured and unobscured quasars that gives origin to the X-ray background; (3) a piecewise parameterization of the distribution in redshift and column density of intergalactic absorbers that fits recent measurements of the mean free path of 1 ryd photons; (4) an accurate treatment of the photoionization structure of absorbers, which enters in the calculation of the helium continuum opacity and recombination emissivity; and (5) the {UV} emission from star-forming galaxies at all redshifts. We provide tables of the predicted H I and He {II} photoionization and photoheating rates for use, e.g., in cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of the Lyα forest and a new metallicity-dependent calibration to the {UV} luminosity density-star formation rate density relation. A "minimal cosmic reionization model" is also presented in which the galaxy {UV} emissivity traces recent determinations of the cosmic history of star formation, the luminosity-weighted escape fraction of hydrogen-ionizing radiation increases rapidly with look-back time, the clumping factor of the high-redshift intergalactic medium evolves following the results of hydrodynamic simulations, and Population {III} stars and miniquasars make a negligible contribution to the metagalactic flux. The model provides a good fit to the hydrogen-ionization rates inferred from flux decrement and proximity effect measurements, predicts that cosmological H {II} (He {III}) regions overlap at redshift 6.7 (2.8), and yields an optical depth to Thomson scattering, τes = 0.084 that is in agreement with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe results. Our new background intensities and spectra are sensitive to a number of poorly determined input parameters and suffer from various degeneracies. Their predictive power should be constantly tested against new observations.

	abstract = {Because the same massive stars that reionized the intergalactic medium ({IGM}) inevitably exploded as supernovae that polluted the Universe with metals, the history of cosmic reionization and enrichment are intimately intertwined. While the overly sensitive Ly-alpha transition completely saturates in a neutral {IGM}, strong low-ionization metal lines like the {MgII} 2796,2804 doublet will give rise to a detectable `metal-line forest' if the metals produced during reionization (Z {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}Z\_sol) permeate the neutral {IGM}. We simulate the {MgII} forest for the first time by combining a large hydrodynamical simulation with a semi-numerical reionization topology, assuming a simple enrichment model where the {IGM} is uniformly suffused with metals. In contrast to the traditional approach of identifying discrete absorbers, we treat the absorption as a continuous random field and measure its two-point correlation function, leveraging techniques from precision cosmology. We show that a realistic mock dataset of 10 {JWST} spectra can simultaneously determine the Mg abundance, [Mg/H], with a 1sigma precision of 0.02 dex and measure the global neutral fraction {\textless}x\_HI{\textgreater} to 5\% for a Universe with {\textless}x\_HI{\textgreater} = 0.74 and [Mg/H] = -3.7. Alternatively, if the {IGM} is pristine, a null-detection of the {MgII} forest would set a stringent upper limit on the {IGM} metallicity of [Mg/H] {\textless} -4.4 at 95\% credibility, assuming {\textless}x\_HI{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 0.5 from another probe. Concentrations of metals in the circumgalactic environs of galaxies can significantly contaminate the {IGM} signal, but we demonstrate how these discrete absorbers can be easily identified and masked such that their impact on the correlation function is negligible. The {MgII} forest thus has tremendous potential to precisely constrain the reionization and enrichment history of the Universe.},

We quantify the observed evolution by a model in which \${dN}/{dX}\$ decreases linearly with redshift. The model suggests that populations with larger \$W\_r\$ thresholds evolve faster with redshift and appear later in the universe. The cosmological \{{\textbackslash}sc Technicolor Dawn\} simulations at \$3{\textbackslash}leq z {\textbackslash}leq5\$ over-produce the observed abundance of absorbers with \$W\_r{\textless}0.3\${\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}{AA}\}, while yielding good agreement at higher \$W\_r\$. Our empirical linear model successfully describes {CIV} evolution in the simulations and the observed evolution of \$W\_r {\textbackslash}geq 0.6\${\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}{AA}\} {CIV} for the past \${\textbackslash}sim12\$ Gyr. Combining our measurements with the literature gives us a picture of {CIV}-absorbing structures becoming more numerous and/or larger in physical size over the last \${\textbackslash}approx13\$ Gyr of cosmic time (\$z{\textbackslash}sim6\$ to \$z{\textbackslash}sim0\$).},

	abstract = {We present a comparison of the physical properties of the gas in the circumgalactic ({CGM}) and intergalactic ({IGM}) media at \$z{\textbackslash}sim0\$ between observations and four cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: Illustris, {TNG}300 of the {IllustrisTNG} project, {EAGLE}, and one of the Magneticum simulations. For the observational data, we use the gas properties that are inferred from cross-correlating the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect ({SZE}) from the \{{\textbackslash}it Planck\} {CMB} maps with the haloes and the large-scale structure reconstructed from Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. Both the observational and simulation results indicate that the integrated gas pressure in haloes deviates from the self-similar case, showing that feedback impacts haloes with \$M\_\{500\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{12-13\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. The simulations predict that more than half the baryons are displaced from haloes, while the gas fraction inferred from our observational data roughly equals the cosmic baryon fraction throughout the \$M\_\{500\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{12-14.5\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ halo mass range. All simulations tested here predict that the mean gas temperature in haloes is about the virial temperature, while that inferred from the {SZE} is up to one order of magnitude lower than that from the simulations (and also from X-ray observations). While a remarkable agreement is found for the average properties of the {IGM} between the observation and some simulations, we show that their dependence on the large-scale tidal field can break the degeneracy between models that show similar predictions otherwise. Finally, we show that the gas pressure and the electron density profiles from simulations are not well described by a generalized {NFW} ({GNFW}) profile. Instead, we present a new model with a mass-dependent shape that fits the profiles accurately.},

	abstract = {The Galactic disk is expected to be spatially, kinematically, and chemically clustered on many scales due to both star formation and non-axisymmetries in the Galactic potential. In this work we calculate the spatial and kinematic two-point correlation functions using a sample of \$1.7 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}6\$ stars within 1 kpc of the Sun with 6D phase space information available from {\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\} {DR}2. Clustering is detected on spatial scales of 1-300 pc and velocity scales of at least 15 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. With bound structures included, the data have a power-law index (\${\textbackslash}xi({\textbackslash}Delta r) {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}Delta r{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}gamma\}\$) of \${\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}approx-2\$ at most spatial scales, which is in line with theoretical predictions.

We interpret these results with the aid of a novel star-by-star simulation of the Galaxy in which stars are born in clusters orbiting in a realistic potential that includes spiral arms, a bar, and {GMCs}. We find that the simulation largely agrees with the observations (within a factor of 2-3) at all spatial and kinematic scales. In detail, the correlation function in the simulation is shallower than the data at \${\textless} 20\$ pc scales, and steeper than the data at \${\textgreater} 30\$ pc scales. We also find a persistent clustering signal in the kinematic correlation function for the data at large \${\textbackslash}Delta v\$ (\${\textgreater}5\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) not present in the simulations. We speculate that this mismatch between observations and simulations may be due to two processes not included in the simulation: hierarchical star formation and transient spiral arms. We also use the simulations to predict the clustering signal as a function of pair-wise metallicity and age separations. Ages and metallicities measured with a precision of \$50{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$0.05\$ dex are required in order to enhance the clustering signal.},

Moreover, new proper motion estimates match with our region of backsplash solutions. \%This suggests that Leo T is likely a pristine system. We applied our method to other distant {MW} satellites, finding a range of gas stripped backsplash solutions for the gas-less Cetus and Eridanus {II}, providing a possible explanation for their lack of cold gas, while only first in-fall solutions are found for the {HI} rich Phoenix I. We also find that the cosmic expansion can delay their first pericenter passage when compared to the non-expanding scenario. This study explores the provenance of these distant dwarfs and provides constraints on the environmental and internal processes that shaped their evolution and current properties.},

This radio galaxy has extended Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission over a region {\textasciitilde}100 kpc in size preferentially oriented along the axis of the radio jet.

Here we report on the 2018 flight of the {FIREBall}-2 Balloon telescope, which occurred on September 22nd, 2018 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico. The flight was the culmination of a complete redesign of the spectrograph from the original {FIREBall} fiber-fed {IFU} to a wide-field multi-object spectrograph. The flight was terminated early due to a hole in the balloon, and our original science objectives were not achieved. The overall sensitivity of the instrument and telescope was 90,000 {LU}, due primarily to increased noise from stray light. We discuss the design of the {FIREBall}-2 spectrograph, modifications from the original {FIREBall} payload, and provide an overview of the performance of all systems. We were able to successfully flight test a new pointing control system, a {UV}-optimized, delta-doped and coated {EMCCD}, and an aspheric grating.

	abstract = {Understanding the variability of galaxy star formation histories ({SFHs}) across a range of timescales provides insight into the underlying physical processes that regulate star formation within galaxies. We compile the {SFHs} of galaxies at \$z=0\$ from an extensive set of models, ranging from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (Illustris, {IllustrisTNG}, Mufasa, Simba, {EAGLE}), zoom simulations ({FIRE}-2, g14, and Marvel/Justice League), semi-analytic models (Santa Cruz {SAM}) and empirical models ({UniverseMachine}), and quantify the variability of these {SFHs} on different timescales using the power spectral density ({PSD}) formalism. We find that the {PSDs} are well described by broken power-laws, and variability on long timescales (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim1\$ Gyr) accounts for most of the power in galaxy {SFHs}. Most hydrodynamical models show increased variability on shorter timescales (\${\textbackslash}lesssim300\$ Myr) with decreasing stellar mass. Quenching can induce \${\textbackslash}sim0.4-1\$ dex of additional power on timescales \${\textgreater}1\$ Gyr. The dark matter accretion histories of galaxies have remarkably self-similar {PSDs} and are coherent with the in-situ star formation on timescales \${\textgreater}3\$ Gyr. There is considerable diversity among the different models in their (i) power due to {SFR} variability at a given timescale, (ii) amount of correlation with adjacent timescales ({PSD} slope), (iii) evolution of median {PSDs} with stellar mass, and (iv) presence and locations of breaks in the {PSDs}. The {PSD} framework is a useful space to study the {SFHs} of galaxies since model predictions vary widely. Observational constraints in this space will help constrain the relative strengths of the physical processes responsible for this variability.},

	abstract = {Any successful alternative gravity theory that obviates the need for dark matter must fit our cosmological observations. Measurements of microwave background polarization trace the large-scale baryon velocity field at recombination and show very strong, \$O(1)\$, baryon acoustic oscillations. Measurements of the large-scale structure of galaxies at low redshift show much weaker features in the spectrum. If the alternative gravity theory's dynamical equations for the growth rate of structure are linear, then the density field growth can be described by a Green's function: \${\textbackslash}delta({\textbackslash}vec x,t) = {\textbackslash}delta({\textbackslash}vec x,t')G(x,t,t')\$. We show that the Green function, \$G(x,t,t')\$, must have dramatic features that erase the initial baryon oscillations. This implies an acceleration law that changes sign on the \${\textbackslash}sim 150\$ Mpc scale. On the other hand, if the alternative gravity theory has a large nonlinear term that couples modes on different scales, then the theory would predict large-scale non-Gaussian features in large-scale structure. These are not seen in the distribution of galaxies nor in the distribution of quasars. No proposed alternative gravity theory for dark matter seems to satisfy these constraints.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00018},
	abstract = {In the outskirts of the intracluster medium ({ICM}) in galaxy clusters, the temperature decreases with radius. Due to the weakly collisional nature of the plasma, these regions are susceptible to the magneto-thermal instability ({MTI}), which can sustain turbulence and provide turbulent pressure support in the {ICM}. This instability arises due to heat conduction directed along the magnetic field, with a heat conductivity which is normally assumed to be given by the Spitzer value. Recent numerical studies of the ion mirror and the electron whistler instability using particle-in-cell codes have shown that microscale instabilities can lead to a reduced value for the heat conductivity in the {ICM}. This could in turn influence the efficiency with which the {MTI} drives turbulence. In this paper we investigate the influence of reduced heat transport on the nonlinear evolution of the {MTI} by employing a subgrid model that mimics the influence of the mirror instability on the heat conductivity. We use this subgrid model to assess the effect of microscales on the large scale dynamics of the {ICM}. We find that the nonlinear saturation of the {MTI} is surprisingly robust. Over a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}3\$ the thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratio and collisionality we find at most modest changes to the saturation of the {MTI} with respect to reference simulations where heat transport is unsuppressed.},

	abstract = {Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution attempt to fully model the physics that shapes galaxies. The agreement between the morphology of simulated and real galaxies, and the way the morphological types are distributed across galaxy scaling relations are important probes of our knowledge of galaxy formation physics. Here we propose an unsupervised deep learning approach to perform a stringent test of the fine morphological structure of galaxies coming from the Illustris and {IllustrisTNG} ({TNG}100 and {TNG}50) simulations against observations from a subsample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our framework is based on {PixelCNN}, an autoregressive model for image generation with an explicit likelihood. We adopt a strategy that combines the output of two {PixelCNN} networks in a metric that isolates the fine morphological details of galaxies from the sky background. We are able to {\textbackslash}emph\{quantitatively\} identify the improvements of {IllustrisTNG}, particularly in the high-resolution {TNG}50 run, over the original Illustris. However, we find that the fine details of galaxy structure are still different between observed and simulated galaxies. This difference is driven by small, more spheroidal, and quenched galaxies which are globally less accurate regardless of resolution and which have experienced little improvement between the three simulations explored. We speculate that this disagreement, that is less severe for quenched disky galaxies, may stem from a still too coarse numerical resolution, which struggles to properly capture the inner, dense regions of quenched spheroidal galaxies.},

Our study includes 13 halos spanning low-mass dwarfs (M\_vir{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10 M\_sun at z=0), intermediate-mass dwarfs (M\_vir{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}11 M\_sun) and Milky Way-mass galaxies (M\_vir{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}12 M\_sun). The {SAM} and {FIRE}-2 predictions agree relatively well with each other in terms of stellar and interstellar mass, but differ dramatically on circumgalactic mass (the {SAM} is lower than {FIRE}-2 by {\textasciitilde}3 orders of magnitude for dwarfs). Strikingly, the {SAM} predicts higher gas accretion rates for dwarfs compared to {FIRE}-2 by factors of {\textasciitilde}10-100, and this is compensated for with higher mass outflow rates in the {SAM}. We argue that the most severe model discrepancies are caused by the lack of preventative stellar feedback and the assumptions for halo gas cooling and recycling in the {SAM}. As a first step towards resolving these model tensions, we present a simple yet promising new preventative stellar feedback model in which the energy carried by supernova-driven winds is allowed to heat some fraction of gas outside of halos to at least the virial temperature such that accretion is suppressed.},

	abstract = {Using {MUSE} observations from the {GASP} survey, we study 54 galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping ({RPS}) spanning a wide range in galaxy mass and host cluster mass. We use this rich sample to study how the star formation rate ({SFR}) in the tails of stripped gas depends on the properties of the galaxy and its host cluster. We show that the interplay between all the parameters involved is complex and that there is not a single, dominant one in shaping the observed amount of {SFR}. Hence, we develop a simple analytical approach to describe the mass fraction of stripped gas and the {SFR} in the tail, as a function of the cluster velocity dispersion, galaxy stellar mass, clustercentric distance and speed in the intracluster medium. Our model provides a good description of the observed gas truncation radius and of the fraction of star-formation rate ({SFR}) observed in the stripped tails, once we take into account the fact that the star formation efficiency in the tails is a factor \${\textbackslash}sim 5\$ lower than in the galaxy disc, in agreement with {GASP} ongoing {HI} and {CO} observations. We finally estimate the contribution of {RPS} to the intracluster light ({ICL}) and find that the average {SFR} in the tails of ram-pressure stripped gas is \${\textbackslash}sim 0.22 M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} \$ per cluster. By extrapolating this result to evaluate the contribution to the {ICL} at different epochs, we compute an integrated average value per cluster of \${\textbackslash}sim 4 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ of stars formed in the tails of {RPS} galaxies since \$z{\textbackslash}sim 1\$.},

Wind-{ISM} collisions generate astrospheres around these stars that contain hot \$T{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}7\$ K gas that adiabatically expands. As individual bubbles expand and collide they become unstable, potentially driving turbulence in star clusters. In this paper we use hydrodynamic simulations to model a densely populated young star cluster within a homogeneous cloud to study stellar wind collisions with the surrounding {ISM}. We model a mass-segregated cluster of 20 B-type young main sequence stars with masses ranging from 3--17 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. We evolve the winds for \${\textbackslash}sim\$11 kyrs and show that wind-{ISM} collisions and over-lapping wind-blown bubbles around B-stars mixes the hot gas and {ISM} material generating Kolmogorov-like turbulence on small scales early in its evolution. We discuss how turbulence driven by stellar winds may impact the subsequent generation of star formation in the cluster},

	abstract = {Using new ultraviolet ({UV}) spectra of five background quasars from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope, we analyze the low-latitude ({\textbar}b{\textbar}=20-30 degree) regions of the Fermi Bubbles, the giant gamma-ray emitting lobes at the Galactic Center. We combine these data with previous {UV} and atomic hydrogen ({HI}) datasets to build a comprehensive picture of the kinematics and metal column densities of the cool outflowing clouds entrained in the Fermi Bubbles. We find that the number of {UV} absorption components per sightline decreases as a function of increasing latitude, suggesting that the outflowing clouds become less common with increasing latitude. The Fermi Bubble {HI} clouds are accelerated up to b{\textasciitilde}7 degree, whereas when we model the {UV} Fermi Bubbles clouds deprojected flow velocities, we find that they are flat or even accelerating with distance from the Galactic center. This trend, which holds in both the northern and southern hemispheres, indicates that the nuclear outflow accelerates clouds throughout the Fermi Bubbles or has an acceleration phase followed by a coasting phase. Finally, we note the existence of several blueshifted high-velocity clouds at latitudes exceeding {\textasciitilde}30 degree, whose velocities cannot be explained by gas clouds confined to the inside of the gamma-ray defined Fermi Bubbles. These anomalous velocity clouds are likely in front of the Fermi Bubbles and could be remnants from past nuclear outflows. Overall, these observations form a valuable set of empirical data on the properties of cool gas in nuclear winds from star-forming galaxies.},

	abstract = {Galactic outflows are known to consist of several gas phases, however, so far the connection between these multiple phases has been investigated little and only in a few objects. In this paper, we analyse {MUSE}/{VLT} data of 26 local (U){LIRGs} and study their ionised and neutral atomic phases. We also include objects from the literature to obtain a total sample of 31 galaxies with spatially resolved multi-phase outflow information. We find that the ionized phase of the outflows has on average an electron density three times higher than the disc (\$n\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e, disc\}\$ \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 150 cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ vs \$n\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e, outflow\}\$ \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 500 cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$), suggesting that cloud compression in the outflow is more important that cloud dissipation. We find that the difference in extinction between outflow and disc correlates with the outflow gas mass. Together with the analysis of the outflow velocities, this suggests that at least some of the outflows are associated with the ejection of dusty clouds from the disc. The presence of dust in outflows is relevant for potential formation of molecules inside them. We combine our data with millimetre data to investigate the molecular phase. We find that the molecular phase accounts for more than 60 \${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the total mass outflow rate in most objects and this fraction is higher in {AGN}-dominated systems. The neutral atomic phase contributes of the order of 10 \${\textbackslash}\%\$, while the ionized phase is negligible. The ionized-to-molecular mass outflow rate declines slightly with {AGN} luminosity, although with a large scatter.},

	abstract = {We examine the influence of dark matter halo assembly on the evolution of a simulated \${\textbackslash}sim L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}star\$ galaxy. Starting from a zoom-in simulation of a star-forming galaxy evolved with the {EAGLE} galaxy formation model, we use the genetic modification technique to create a pair of complementary assembly histories: one in which the halo assembles later than in the unmodified case, and one in which it assembles earlier. Delayed assembly leads to the galaxy exhibiting a greater present-day star formation rate than its unmodified counterpart, whilst in the accelerated case the galaxy quenches at \$z{\textbackslash}simeq 1\$, and becomes spheroidal. We simulate each assembly history nine times, adopting different seeds for the random number generator used by {EAGLE}'s stochastic subgrid implementations of star formation and feedback. The systematic changes driven by differences in assembly history are significantly stronger than the random scatter induced by this stochasticity. The sensitivity of \${\textbackslash}sim L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}star\$ galaxy evolution to dark matter halo assembly follows from the close coupling of the growth histories of the central black hole ({BH}) and the halo, such that earlier assembly fosters the formation of a more massive {BH}, and more efficient expulsion of circumgalactic gas. In response to this expulsion, the circumgalactic medium reconfigures at a lower density, extending its cooling time and thus inhibiting the replenishment of the interstellar medium. Our results indicate that halo assembly history significantly influences the evolution of \${\textbackslash}sim L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}star\$ central galaxies, and that the expulsion of circumgalactic gas is a crucial step in quenching them.},

We demonstrate that when the halo mass crosses {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}12 M\_sun, the cooling time of shocked gas in the inner {CGM} ({\textasciitilde}0.1 R\_vir, where R\_vir is the virial radius) exceeds the local free-fall time. The inner {CGM} then experiences a transition from on average sub-virial temperatures (T{\textless}{\textless}T\_vir), large pressure fluctuations and supersonic inflow/outflow velocities, to virial temperatures (T{\textasciitilde}T\_vir), uniform pressures and subsonic velocities. This transition occurs when the outer {CGM} ({\textasciitilde}0.5 R\_vir) is already subsonic and has a temperature {\textasciitilde}T\_vir, indicating that the longer cooling times at large radii allow the outer {CGM} to virialize at lower halo masses than the inner {CGM}. This outside-in {CGM} virialization scenario is in contrast with inside-out scenarios commonly envisioned based on more idealized simulations. We demonstrate that virialization of the inner {CGM} coincides with abrupt changes in the properties of the central galaxy and its stellar feedback: the galaxy settles into a stable rotating disc, star formation transitions from `bursty' to `steady,' and stellar-driven galaxy-scale outflows are suppressed. Our results hence suggest that {CGM} virialization is initially associated with the formation of rotation-dominated thin galactic discs, rather than with the quenching of star formation as often assumed.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13945},
	abstract = {We examine the thermodynamic state and cooling of the low-\$z\$ Circum-Galactic Medium ({CGM}) in five {FIRE}-2 galaxy formation simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find that the {CGM} in these simulations is generally multiphase and dynamic, with a wide spectrum of largely nonlinear density perturbations sourced by the accretion of gas from the {IGM} and winds from both the central and satellite galaxies. We investigate the origin of the multiphase structure of the {CGM} with a particle tracking analysis and find that most of the low entropy gas has cooled from the hot halo as a result of thermal instability triggered by these perturbations. The ratio of cooling to free-fall timescales \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ in the hot component of the {CGM} spans a wide range \${\textbackslash}sim 1-100\$ at a given radius, but exhibits approximately constant median values \${\textbackslash}sim 5-20\$ at all radii \$0.1 R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\} {\textless} r {\textless} R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$. These are similar to the \${\textbackslash}approx 10-20\$ value typically adopted as the thermal instability threshold in "precipitation" models of the {ICM}. Consequently, a one-dimensional model based on the assumption of a constant \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ and hydrostatic equilibrium approximately reproduces the simulation number density and entropy profiles, but only if it assumes the metallicity profiles taken directly from the simulations. We explicitly show that the \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ value of a gas parcel in the hot component of the {CGM} does not predict its probability of cooling and subsequently accreting onto the central galaxy. This suggests that the value of \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ is a poor predictor of thermal stability in gaseous halos in which large-amplitude density perturbations are prevalent.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10764},
	abstract = {It is well known that gas in galaxy discs is highly turbulent, but there is much debate on which mechanism can energetically maintain this turbulence. Among the possible candidates, supernova ({SN}) explosions are likely the primary drivers but doubts remain on whether they can be sufficient in regions of moderate star formation activity, in particular in the outer parts of discs. In this paper, we measure the {SN} efficiency \${\textbackslash}eta\$, namely the fraction of the total {SN} energy needed to sustain turbulence in galaxies, and verify that {SNe} can indeed be the sole driving mechanism. The key novelty of our approach is that we take into account the increased turbulence dissipation timescale associated to the flaring in outer regions of gaseous discs. We analyse the distribution and kinematics of {HI} and {CO} in 10 nearby star-forming galaxies to obtain the radial profiles of the kinetic energy per unit area, for both the atomic gas and the molecular gas. We use a theoretical model to reproduce the observed energy with the sum of turbulent energy from {SNe}, as inferred from the observed star formation rate ({SFR}) surface density, and the gas thermal energy. We find that the observed kinetic energy is remarkably well reproduced by our model across the whole extent of the galactic discs, assuming \${\textbackslash}eta\$ constant with the galactocentric radius. Taking into account the uncertainties on the {SFR} surface density and on the atomic gas phase, we obtain that the median {SN} efficiencies for our sample of galaxies are \${\textbackslash}langle {\textbackslash}eta\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{atom\} {\textbackslash}rangle=0.015\_\{-0.008\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.018\}\$ for the atomic gas and \${\textbackslash}langle {\textbackslash}eta\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mol\} {\textbackslash}rangle = 0.003\_\{-0.002\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.006\}\$ for the molecular gas. We conclude that {SNe} alone can sustain gas turbulence in nearby galaxies with only few percent of their energy and that there is essentially no need for any further source of energy.},

	abstract = {There is an emerging consensus that large amounts of gas do not shock heat in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) of massive galaxies, but instead pierce deep into haloes from the cosmic web via filaments. To better resolve this process numerically, we have developed a novel `shock refinement' scheme within the moving mesh code {AREPO} that adaptively increases resolution around shocks on-the-fly in galaxy formation simulations. We apply this to a very massive \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ halo at \$z=6\$ using the successful {FABLE} model. With increased refinement there are significantly more dense, metal-poor and fast-moving filaments and clumps flowing into the halo, leading to a more multiphase {CGM}. We find up to a 50 per cent boost in cool-dense gas mass and a 25 per cent increase in inflowing mass flux. Better resolved accretion shocks cause turbulence to increase dramatically within the halo, leading to a doubling in the halo's non-thermal pressure support. Despite much higher energy dissipation at shocks with higher resolution, increased cooling rates suppress the thermal energy of the halo. In contrast, the faster and denser filaments cause a jump of 50 per cent in the bulk kinetic energy of cool-dense gas, while in the hot phase turbulent energy increases by 50 per cent. Moreover, {HI} covering fractions within the {CGM} increase by up to 60 per cent. Consequently star formation is spread more widely and we predict a population of metal-poor stars forming within primordial filaments that deep {JWST} observations may be able to probe.},

We have compared various physical properties of star forming galaxies, such as specific star formation rates (burstiness) and morphologies (merger) as a function of environment; cluster center, older group, younger group, and the field. As a result, a global picture has emerged on how the galaxy properties are altered as they assemble into a denser region.

We extract spectra from 11 regions up to 2.5 kpc from the starbursting midplane and model the data as a multi-temperature, optically thin thermal plasma with contributions from a non-thermal (power-law) component and from charge exchange ({CX}). We examine the gradients in best-fit parameters, including the intrinsic column density, plasma temperature, metal abundances, and number density of the hot gas as a function of distance from the M82 nucleus. We find that the temperatures and number densities of the warm-hot and hot plasma peak at the starbursting ridge and decreases along the minor axis. The temperature and density profiles are inconsistent with spherical adiabatic expansion of a super-heated wind and suggest mass loading and mixing of the hot phase with colder material. Non-thermal emission is detected in all of the regions considered, and {CX} comprises 7-22\% of the total absorption-corrected, broad-band (0.5-7 {keV}) X-ray flux. We show that the abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe are roughly constant across the regions considered, while Si and S peak within 500 pc of the central starburst.

	abstract = {Using the {VINTERGATAN} cosmological zoom simulation, we explore the contributions of the in situ and accreted material, and the effect of galaxy interactions and mergers in the assembly of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We find that the initial growth phase of galaxy evolution, dominated by repeated major mergers, provides the necessary physical conditions for the assembly of a thick, kinematically hot disk populated by high-[\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] stars, formed both in situ and in accreted satellite galaxies. We find that the diversity of evolutionary tracks followed by the simulated galaxy and its progenitors leads to very little overlap of the in situ and accreted populations for any given chemical composition. At a given age, the spread in [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] abundance ratio results from the diversity of physical conditions in {VINTERGATAN} and its satellites, with an enhancement in [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] found in stars formed during starburst episodes. Later, the cessation of the merger activity promotes the in situ formation of stars in the low-[\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] regime, in a radially extended, thin and overall kinematically colder disk, thus establishing chemically bimodal thin and thick disks, in line with observations. We draw links between notable features in the [Fe/H] - [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] plane with their physical causes, and propose a comprehensive formation scenario explaining self-consistently, in the cosmological context, the main observed properties of the Milky Way.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05997},
	abstract = {We present a new implementation for active galactic nucleus ({AGN}) feedback through small-scale, ultra-fast winds in the moving-mesh hydrodynamic code {AREPO}. The wind is injected by prescribing mass, momentum and energy fluxes across a spherical boundary centred on a supermassive black hole according to available constraints for accretion disc winds. After sweeping-up a mass equal to their own, small-scale winds thermalise, powering energy-driven outflows with dynamics, structure and cooling properties in excellent agreement with those of analytic wind solutions. Momentum-driven solutions do not easily occur, because the Compton cooling radius is usually much smaller than the free-expansion radius of the small-scale winds. Through various convergence tests, we demonstrate that our implementation yields wind solutions which are well converged down to the typical resolution achieved in cosmological simulations. We test our model in hydrodynamic simulations of isolated Milky Way - mass galaxies. Above a critical {AGN} luminosity, initially spherical, small-scale winds power bipolar, energy-driven super-winds that break out of the galactic nucleus, flowing at speeds \${\textgreater} 1000 {\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, km {\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ out to \${\textbackslash}sim 10 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm kpc\$. These energy-driven outflows result in moderate, but long-term, reduction in star formation, which becomes more pronounced for higher {AGN} luminosities and faster small-scale winds. Suppression of star formation proceeds through a rapid mode that involves the removal of the highest-density, nuclear gas and through a slower mode that effectively halts halo gas accretion. Our new implementation makes it possible to model {AGN}-driven winds in a physically meaningful and validated way in simulations of galaxy evolution, the interstellar medium and black hole accretion flows.},

	abstract = {The circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) of nearby star-forming galaxies shows clear indications of {OVI} absorption accompanied by little to no detectable {NV} absorption. This unusual spectral signature, accompanied by highly non-uniform absorption from lower ionization state species, indicates that the {CGM} must be viewed as a dynamic, multiphase medium, such as occurs in the presence of turbulence. Motivated by previous isotropic turbulent simulations, we carry out chemodynamical simulations of stratified media in a Navarro-Frenk-White ({NFW}) gravitational potential with a total mass of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ solar masses and turbulence that decreases radially. The simulations assume a metallicity of 0.3 solar, a redshift zero metagalatic {UV} background, and they track ionizations, recombinations, and species-by-species radiative cooling using the {MAIHEM} package. We compare a suite of ionic column densities with the {COS}-Halos sample of low-redshift star-forming galaxies. Turbulence with an average one-dimensional velocity dispersion approximately 40 km/s, corresponding to an energy injection rate of approximately \$10{\textasciicircum}\{49\}\$ erg/yr, produces a {CGM} that matches many of the observed ionic column densities and ratios. In this simulation, the {NVI} to {OVI} ratio is suppressed from its equilibrium value due to a combination of radiative cooling and cooling from turbulent mixing. This level of turbulence is consistent with expectations from observations of better constrained, higher-mass systems, and could be sustained by energy input from supernovae, gas inflows, and dynamical friction from dark matter subhalos. We also conduct a higher resolution run which yields smaller-scale structures, but remains in agreement with observations.},

	abstract = {Low-mass satellites around Milky Way ({MW})-like galaxies are important probes of small scale structure and galaxy formation. However, confirmation of satellite candidates with distance measurements remains a key barrier to fast progress in the Local Volume ({LV}). We measure the surface brightness fluctuation ({SBF}) distances to recently cataloged candidate dwarf satellites around 10 massive hosts within \$D{\textless}12\$ Mpc to confirm association. The satellite systems of these hosts are complete and mostly cleaned of contaminants down to \$M\_g\{{\textbackslash}sim\}-9\$ to \$-10\$, within the area of the search footprints. Joining this sample with hosts surveyed to comparable or better completeness in the literature, we explore how well cosmological simulations combined with common stellar to halo mass relations ({SHMR}) match observed satellite luminosity functions in the classical satellite luminosity regime. Adopting a {SHMR} that matches hydrodynamic simulations, the predicted overall satellite abundance agrees well with the observations. The {MW} is remarkably typical in its luminosity function amongst {LV} hosts. Contrary to recent results, we find that the host-to-host scatter predicted by the model is in close agreement with the scatter between the observed systems, once the different masses of the observed systems are taken into account. However, we find significant evidence that the observed systems have more bright and fewer faint satellites than the {SHMR} model predicts, necessitating a higher normalization of the {SHMR} around halo masses of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ {\textbackslash}msun{\textbackslash} than present in common {SHMRs}. These results demonstrate the utility of nearby satellite systems in inferring the galaxy-subhalo connection in the low-mass regime.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02751},
	abstract = {It is generally recognized that massive galaxies form through a combination of in-situ collapse and ex-situ accretion. The in-situ component forms early, where gas collapse and compaction leads to the formation of massive compact systems (blue and red "nuggets") seen at \$z{\textgreater}1\$. The subsequent accretion of satellites brings in ex-situ material, growing these nuggets in size and mass to appear as the massive early-type galaxies ({ETGs}) we see locally. Due to stochasticity in the accretion process, in a few rare cases a red nugget will evolve to the present day having undergone little ex-situ mass accretion. The resulting massive, compact and ancient objects have been termed "relic galaxies". Detailed stellar population and kinematic analyses are required to characterise these systems. However, an additional crucial aspect lies in determining the fraction of ex-situ mass they have accreted since their formation. Globular cluster systems can be used to constrain this fraction, since the oldest and most metal-poor globular clusters in massive galaxies are primarily an accreted, ex-situ population. Models for the formation of relic galaxies and their globular cluster systems suggest that, due to their early compaction and limited accretion of dark-matter dominated satellites, relic galaxies should have characteristically low dark-matter mass fractions compared to {ETGs} of the same stellar mass.},

Our results suggest that spin is a fundamental property of filaments, part of a full picture of structure formation. Filaments are likely to be the longest coherently rotating objects in the Universe. This finding helps to explain how galaxies spin in the cosmic web, and could provide a mechanism to generate intergalactic magnetic fields.},

	abstract = {We use the {EAGLE} suite of hydrodynamical simulations to analyse accretion rates (and the breakdown of their constituent channels) onto haloes over cosmic time, comparing the behaviour of baryons and dark matter ({DM}). We also investigate the influence of sub-grid baryon physics on halo-scale inflow, specifically the consequences of modelling radiative cooling, as well as feedback from stars and active galactic nuclei ({AGN}). We find that variations in halo baryon fractions at fixed mass (particularly their circum-galactic medium gas content) are very well correlated with variations in the baryon fraction of accreting matter, which we show to be heavily suppressed by stellar feedback in low-mass haloes, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}{\textbackslash}lesssim10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. Breaking down accretion rates into first infall, recycled, transfer and merger components, we show that baryons are much more likely to be smoothly accreted than to have originated from mergers when compared to {DM}, finding (averaged across halo mass) a merger contribution of \${\textbackslash}approx6{\textbackslash}\%\$ for baryons, and \${\textbackslash}approx15{\textbackslash}\%\$ for {DM} at \$z{\textbackslash}approx0\$. We also show that the breakdown of inflow into different channels is strongly dependent on sub-grid physics, particularly the contribution of recycled accretion (accreting matter that has been previously ejected from progenitor haloes). Our findings highlight the dual role that baryonic feedback plays in regulating the evolution of galaxies and haloes: by (i) directly removing gas from haloes, and (ii) suppressing gas inflow to haloes.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00004},
	abstract = {We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to investigate how initial density profiles of giant molecular clouds ({GMCs}) affect their subsequent evolution. We find that the star formation duration and integrated star formation efficiency of the whole clouds are not sensitive to the choice of different profiles but are mainly controlled by the interplay between gravitational collapse and stellar feedback. Despite this similarity, {GMCs} with different profiles show dramatically different modes of star formation. For shallower profiles, {GMCs} first fragment into many self-gravitation cores and form sub-clusters that distributed throughout the entire clouds. These sub-clusters are later assembled ``hierarchically'' to central clusters. In contrast, for steeper profiles, a massive cluster is quickly formed at the center of the cloud and then gradually grows its mass via gas accretion. Consequently, central clusters that emerged from clouds with shallower profiles are less massive and show less rotation than those with the steeper profiles. This is because 1) a significant fraction of mass and angular momentum in shallower profiles is stored in the orbital motion of the sub-clusters that are not able to merge into the central clusters 2) frequent hierarchical mergers in the shallower profiles lead to further losses of mass and angular momentum via violent relaxation and tidal disruption. Encouragingly, the degree of cluster rotations in steeper profiles is consistent with recent observations of young and intermediate-age clusters. We speculate that rotating globular clusters are likely formed via an ``accretion'' mode from centrally-concentrated clouds in the early Universe.},

We use the ``Spectroscopy and H-band Imaging of Virgo cluster galaxies'' ({SHIVir}) survey with photometric and dynamical profiles for 190 Virgo cluster galaxies to establish a relation between the stellar and dynamical masses measured within the isophotal radius \$r\_\{23.5\}\$. Various dark matter and galaxy scaling relations are combined with results from the {NIHAO} suite of hydrodynamical simulations to recast {AM} predictions in terms of these observed quantities. Our results are quite insensitive to the exact choice of dark matter profile and halo response to baryon collapse. We find that theoretical models reproduce the slope and normalization of the observed stellar-to-halo mass relation ({SHMR}) over more than three orders of magnitude in stellar mass \$(10{\textasciicircum}8 {\textless} M\_*/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textless} 2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\})\$.

For systems with stellar masses exceeding \$5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, {AM} overpredicts the observed stellar masses for a given dynamical mass. The latter offset may support previous indications of a different stellar initial mass function in these massive galaxies.

	abstract = {Horizon Run 5 ({HR}5) is a cosmological hydrodynamics simulation which captures the properties of the Universe on a Gpc scale while achieving a resolution of 1 kpc. This enormous dynamic range allows us to simultaneously capture the physics of the cosmic web on very large scales and account for the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies on much smaller scales. Inside the simulation box we zoom-in on a high-resolution cuboid region with a volume of 1049x114x114 Mpc{\textasciicircum}3. The sub-grid physics chosen to model galaxy formation includes radiative heating/cooling, reionization, star formation, supernova feedback, chemical evolution tracking the enrichment of oxygen and iron, the growth of supermassive black holes and active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) feedback in the form of a dual jet-heating mode. For this simulation we implemented a hybrid {MPI}-{OpenMP} version of the {RAMSES} code, specifically targeted for modern many-core many thread parallel architectures. For the post-processing, we extended the Friends-of-Friend ({FoF}) algorithm and developed a new galaxy finder to analyse the large outputs of {HR}5. The simulation successfully reproduces many observations, such as the cosmic star formation history, connectivity of galaxy distribution and stellar mass functions. The simulation also indicates that hydrodynamical effects on small scales impact galaxy clustering up to very large scales near and beyond the baryonic acoustic oscillation ({BAO}) scale. Hence, caution should be taken when using that scale as a cosmic standard ruler: one should carefully understand the corresponding biases. The simulation is expected to be an invaluable asset for the interpretation of upcoming deep surveys of the Universe.},

	abstract = {Pressure balance plays a central role in models of the interstellar medium ({ISM}), but whether and how pressure balance is realized in a realistic multiphase {ISM} is not yet well understood. We address this question using a set of {FIRE}-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass disk galaxies, in which a multiphase {ISM} is self-consistently shaped by gravity, cooling, and stellar feedback. We analyze how gravity determines the vertical pressure profile as well as how the total {ISM} pressure is partitioned between different phases and components (thermal, dispersion/turbulence, and bulk flows). We show that, on average and consistent with previous more idealized simulations, the total {ISM} pressure balances the weight of the overlying gas. Deviations from vertical pressure balance increase with increasing galactocentric radius and with decreasing averaging scale. The different phases are in rough total pressure equilibrium with one another, but with large deviations from thermal pressure equilibrium owing to kinetic support in the cold and warm phases, which dominate the total pressure near the midplane. Bulk flows (e.g., inflows and fountains) are important at a few disk scale heights, while thermal pressure from hot gas dominates at larger heights. Overall, the total midplane pressure is well-predicted by the weight of the disk gas, and we show that it also scales linearly with the star formation rate surface density (Sigma\_SFR). These results support the notion that the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation arises because Sigma\_SFR and the gas surface density (Sigma\_g) are connected via the {ISM} midplane pressure.},

This implies a greater fraction of ionized gas along this sightline is extant outside virialized halos. We also investigate whether the intervening halos can account for the large {FRB} rotation measure and pulse width and conclude that it is implausible.

	abstract = {The Australian {SKA} Pathfinder ({ASKAP}) telescope has started to localize Fast Radio Bursts ({FRBs}) to arcsecond accuracy from the detection of a single pulse, allowing their host galaxies to be reliably identified. We discuss the global properties of the host galaxies of the first four {FRBs} localized by {ASKAP}, which lie in the redshift range \$0.11{\textless}z{\textless}0.48\$. All four are massive galaxies (log( \$M\_\{*\}/ M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) \${\textbackslash}sim 9.4 -10.4\$) with modest star-formation rates of up to \$2M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ -- very different to the host galaxy of the first repeating {FRB} 121102, which is a dwarf galaxy with a high specific star-formation rate. The {FRBs} localized by {ASKAP} typically lie in the outskirts of their host galaxies, which appears to rule out {FRB} progenitor models that invoke active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) or free-floating cosmic strings. The stellar population seen in these host galaxies also disfavors models in which all {FRBs} arise from young magnetars produced by superluminous supernovae ({SLSNe}), as proposed for the progenitor of {FRB} 121102. A range of other progenitor models (including compact-object mergers and magnetars arising from normal core-collapse supernovae) remain plausible.},

	abstract = {More than three quarters of the baryonic content of the Universe resides in a highly diffuse state that is difficult to observe, with only a small fraction directly observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters. Censuses of the nearby Universe have used absorption line spectroscopy to observe these invisible baryons, but these measurements rely on large and uncertain corrections and are insensitive to the majority of the volume, and likely mass. Specifically, quasar spectroscopy is sensitive either to only the very trace amounts of Hydrogen that exists in the atomic state, or highly ionized and enriched gas in denser regions near galaxies. Sunyaev-Zel'dovich analyses provide evidence of some of the gas in filamentary structures and studies of X-ray emission are most sensitive to gas near galaxy clusters. Here we report the direct measurement of the baryon content of the Universe using the dispersion of a sample of localized fast radio bursts ({FRBs}), thus utilizing an effect that measures the electron column density along each sight line and accounts for every ionised baryon. We augment the sample of published arcsecond-localized {FRBs} with a further four new localizations to host galaxies which have measured redshifts of 0.291, 0.118, 0.378 and 0.522, completing a sample sufficiently large to account for dispersion variations along the line of sight and in the host galaxy environment to derive a cosmic baryon density of \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{b\} = 0.051\_\{-0.025\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.021\} {\textbackslash}, h\_\{70\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ (95\% confidence).

	abstract = {The existence of hot, accreted gaseous coronae around massive galaxies is a long-standing central prediction of galaxy formation models in the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} cosmology. While observations now confirm that extraplanar hot gas is present around late-type galaxies, the origin of the gas is uncertain with suggestions that galactic feedback could be the dominant source of energy powering the emission. We investigate the origin and X-ray properties of the hot gas that surrounds galaxies of halo mass, \$(10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}) {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, in the cosmological hydrodynamical {EAGLE} simulations. We find that the central X-ray emission, \${\textbackslash}leq 0.10 R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\}\$, of halos of mass \${\textbackslash}leq 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ originates from gas heated by supernovae ({SNe}). However, beyond this region, a quasi-hydrostatic, accreted atmosphere dominates the X-ray emission in halos of mass \${\textbackslash}geq 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. We predict that a dependence on halo mass of the hot gas to dark matter mass fraction can significantly change the slope of the \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{X\}\}-M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\}\$ relation (which is typically assumed to be \$4/3\$ for clusters) and we derive the scaling law appropriate to this case. As the gas fraction in halos increases with halo mass, we find a steeper slope for the \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{X\}\}-M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\}\$ in lower mass halos, \${\textbackslash}leq 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. This varying gas fraction is driven by active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) feedback. We also identify the physical origin of the so-called "missing feedback" problem, the apparently low X-ray luminosities observed from high star-forming, low-mass galaxies. This is explained by the ejection of {SNe}-heated gas from the central regions of the halo.},

	abstract = {Kinematic studies of disk galaxies, using individual stars in the Milky Way or statistical studies of global disk kinematics over time, provide insight into how disks form and evolve. We use a high-resolution, cosmological zoom-simulation of a Milky Way-mass disk galaxy h277 to tie together local disk kinematics and the evolution of the disk over time. The present-day stellar age-velocity relationship ({AVR}) of h277 is nearly identical to that of the analogous solar-neighborhood measurement in the Milky Way. A crucial element of this success is the simulation's dynamically cold multi-phase {ISM}, which allows young stars to form with a low velocity dispersion (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{birth\}\}\$\${\textbackslash}sim 6 - 8{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) at late times. Older stars are born kinematically hotter (i.e., the disk settles over time in an "upside-down" formation scenario), and are subsequently heated after birth. The disk also grows "inside-out", and many of the older stars in the solar neighborhood at \$z=0\$ are present because of radial mixing. We demonstrate that the evolution of \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{birth\}\}\$ in h277 can be explained by the same model used to describe the general decrease in velocity dispersion observed in disk galaxies from \$z{\textbackslash}sim 2-3\$ to the present-day, in which the disk evolves in quasi-stable equilibrium and the {ISM} velocity dispersion decreases over time due to a decreasing gas fraction. Thus, our results tie together local observations of the Milky Way's {AVR} with observed kinematics of high \$z\$ disk galaxies.},

	abstract = {The role of galactic wind recycling represents one of the largest unknowns in galaxy evolution, as any contribution of recycling to galaxy growth is largely degenerate with the inflow rates of first-time infalling material, and the rates with which outflowing gas and metals are driven from galaxies. We present measurements of the efficiency of wind recycling from the {EAGLE} cosmological simulation project, leveraging the statistical power of large-volume simulations that reproduce a realistic galaxy population. We study wind recycling at the halo scale, i.e. gas that has been ejected beyond the halo virial radius, and at the galaxy scale, i.e. gas that has been ejected from the {ISM} to at least \${\textbackslash}approx 10 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}\%\$ of the virial radius (thus excluding smaller-scale galactic fountains). Galaxy-scale wind recycling is generally inefficient, with a characteristic return timescale that is comparable or longer than a Hubble time, and with an efficiency that clearly peaks at the characteristic halo mass of \$M\_\{200\} = 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. Correspondingly, the majority of gas being accreted onto galaxies in {EAGLE} is infalling for the first time. At the halo scale, the efficiency of recycling onto haloes differs by orders of magnitude from values assumed by semi-analytic galaxy formation models. Differences in the efficiency of wind recycling with other hydrodynamical simulations are currently difficult to assess, but are likely smaller. We are able to show that the fractional contribution of wind recycling to galaxy growth is smaller in {EAGLE} than in some other simulations. We find that cumulative first-time gas accretion rates at the virial radius are reduced relative to the expectation from dark matter accretion for haloes with mass, \$M\_\{200\} {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, indicating efficient preventative feedback on halo scales.},

We discover a significant abundance of small-scale, cold gas structure in the {CGM} of 'red and dead' elliptical systems, as traced by neutral {HI} and {MgII}. Halos can host tens of thousands of discrete absorbing cloudlets, with sizes of order a kpc or smaller. With a Lagrangian tracer analysis, we show that cold clouds form due to strong drho/rho {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1 gas density perturbations which stimulate thermal instability. These local overdensities trigger rapid cooling from the hot virialized background medium at {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}7 K to radiatively inefficient {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}4 K clouds, which act as cosmologically long-lived, 'stimulated cooling' seeds in a regime where the global halo does not satisfy the classic tcool/tff {\textless} 10 criterion. Furthermore, these small clouds are dominated by magnetic rather than thermal pressure, with plasma beta {\textless}{\textless} 1, suggesting that magnetic fields may play an important role. The number and total mass of cold clouds both increase with resolution, and the {\textasciitilde}8x10{\textasciicircum}4 Msun cell mass of {TNG}50 enables the {\textasciitilde}few hundred pc, small-scale {CGM} structure we observe to form. Finally, we contrast against observations from the {COS}-{LRG}, {LRG}-{RDR}, {COS}-Halos, and {SDSS} {LRG} surveys.

	abstract = {Massive disk galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to form at late times in traditional models of galaxy formation, but recent numerical simulations suggest that such galaxies could form as early as a billion years after the Big Bang through the accretion of cold material and mergers. Observationally, it has been difficult to identify disk galaxies in emission at high redshift, in order to discern between competing models of galaxy formation. Here we report imaging, with a resolution of about 1.3 kiloparsecs, of the 158-micrometre emission line from singly ionized carbon, the far-infrared dust continuum and the near-ultraviolet continuum emission from a galaxy at a redshift of 4.2603, identified by detecting its absorption of quasar light. These observations show that the emission arises from gas inside a cold, dusty, rotating disk with a rotational velocity of 272 kilometres per second. The detection of emission from carbon monoxide in the galaxy yields a molecular mass that is consistent with the estimate from the ionized carbon emission of about 72 billion solar masses. The existence of such a massive, rotationally supported, cold disk galaxy when the Universe was only 1.5 billion years old favours formation through either cold-mode accretion or mergers, although its large rotational velocity and large content of cold gas remain challenging to reproduce with most numerical simulations.},

We identify quasars in Simba as the most rapidly-accreting black holes, and show that they are well-matched in bolometric luminosity and correlation strength to real quasars. We extract Lyman-alpha (Ly-a) absorption in spectra passing at different transverse distances (10 kpc \${\textbackslash}lesssim b {\textbackslash}lesssim\$ 10 Mpc) around those quasars, and compare to observations of the mean Ly-a absorption profile. The observations are well reproduced, except within 100 kpc from the foreground quasar, where Simba overproduces absorption; this could potentially be mitigated by including ionisation from the quasar itself. By comparing runs with different feedback modules activated, we find that (mechanical) {AGN} feedback has little impact on the surrounding {CGM} even around these most highly luminous black holes, while stellar feedback has a significant impact. By further investigating thermodynamic and kinematic properties of {CGM} gas, we find that stellar feedback, and not {AGN} feedback, is the primary physical driver in determining the average properties of the {CGM} around \$z{\textbackslash}sim 2-3\$ quasars. We also compare our results with previous works, and find that Simba predicts much more absorption within 100 kpc than the Nyx and Illustris simulations, showing that the Ly-a absorption profile can be a powerful constraint on simulations.

At radii smaller than 50 kpc the {CGM} is dominated by recycled warm-hot gas injected from the central galaxy, while at larger radii it is dominated by cool gas accreted onto the halo.

We introduce the novel publicly available analysis tool {\textbackslash}textsc\{pygad\} to compute ion abundances and mock absorption spectra. For Lyman-\$\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ absorption we find good agreement of the simulated equivalent width ({EW}) distribution and observations out to large radii.

Mergers are no more common in {UDG} than non-{UDG} progenitors, but mergers that create {UDGs} tend to happen earlier, produce a temporary boost in spin, and cause star formation to migrate to the outskirts of galaxies, resulting in lower central star formation rates. The centers of the galaxies fade as their central stellar populations age, but their global star formation rates are maintained through bursts of star formation at larger radii. This formation channel is unique relative to other proposals for {UDG} formation in isolated galaxies, or for {UDGs} in groups and clusters, demonstrating that {UDGs} can potentially be formed through multiple mechanisms.},

It adopts a dynamic execution model based on a simple design called a "task list" that improves parallel performance by overlapping communication and computation, simplifies the inclusion of a diverse range of physics, and even enables multiphysics models involving different physics in different regions of the calculation. We describe physics modules implemented in this framework for both non-relativistic and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ({MHD}). These modules adopt mature and robust algorithms originally developed for the Athena {MHD} code and incorporate new extensions: support for curvilinear coordinates, higher-order time integrators, more realistic physics such as a general equation of state, and diffusion terms that can be integrated with super-time-stepping algorithms. The modules show excellent performance and scaling, with well over 80\% parallel efficiency on over half a million threads. The source code has been made publicly available.},

	abstract = {Star formation is a complex multi-scale phenomenon that is of significant importance for astrophysics in general. Stars and star formation are key pillars in observational astronomy from local star forming regions in the Milky Way up to high-redshift galaxies. From a theoretical perspective, star formation and feedback processes (radiation, winds, and supernovae) play a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the physical processes at work, both individually and of their interactions. In this review we will give an overview of the main processes that are important for the understanding of star formation. We start with an observationally motivated view on star formation from a global perspective and outline the general paradigm of the life-cycle of molecular clouds, in which star formation is the key process to close the cycle. After that we focus on the thermal and chemical aspects in star forming regions, discuss turbulence and magnetic fields as well as gravitational forces. Finally, we review the most important stellar feedback mechanisms.},

	abstract = {We present a semi-analytic model of satellite galaxies, {SatGen}, which can generate large samples of satellite populations for a host halo of desired mass, redshift, and assembly history. The model combines dark-matter halo merger trees, empirical relations for the galaxy-halo connection, and analytic prescriptions for tidal effects, dynamical friction, and ram pressure stripping. {SatGen} emulates cosmological zoom-in hydro-simulations in certain aspects. Satellites can reside in cored or cuspy {DM} subhaloes, depending on the halo response to baryonic physics that can be formulated from hydro-simulations and physical modeling. The subhalo profile and the stellar mass and size of a satellite evolves depending on its tidal mass loss and initial structure. The host galaxy can include a baryonic disc and a stellar bulge, each described by a density profile that allows analytic orbit integration. {SatGen} complements simulations by propagating the effect of halo response found in simulated field galaxies to satellites (not properly resolved in simulations) and outperforms simulations by sampling the halo-to-halo variance of satellite statistics and overcoming artificial disruption due to insufficient resolution. As a first application, we use the model to study satellites of Milky Way sized hosts, making it emulate simulations of bursty star formation and of smooth star formation, respectively, and to experiment with a disc potential in the host halo. Our model reproduces the observed satellite statistics reasonably well. Different physical recipes make a difference in satellite abundance and spatial distribution at the 25\% level, not large enough to be distinguished by current observations given the halo-to-halo variance. The {MW} disc depletes satellites by 20\% and has a subtle effect of diversifying the internal structure of satellites, important for alleviating certain small-scale problems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05991},
	abstract = {Linking globular clusters ({GCs}) to the assembly of their host galaxies is an overarching goal in {GC} studies. The inference of tight scaling relations between {GC} system properties and the mass of both the stellar and dark halo components of their host galaxies are indicative of an intimate physical connection, yet have also raised fundamental questions about how and when {GCs} form. Specifically, the inferred correlation between the mass of a {GC} system (M\_gc) and the dark matter halo mass (M\_halo) of a galaxy has been posited as a consequence of a causal relation between the formation of dark matter mini-haloes and {GC} formation during the early epochs of galaxy assembly. We present the first results from a new simulation of a cosmological volume (L=34.4cMpc on a side) from the E-{MOSAICS} suite, which includes treatments of the formation and evolution of {GCs} within the framework of a detailed galaxy formation model. The simulated M\_gc-M\_halo relation is linear for halo masses \${\textgreater}5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ Msun, and is driven by the hierarchical assembly of galaxies, in agreement with previous studies. Below this halo mass, the simulated relation features a downturn, which we show is consistent with observations, and is driven by the underlying stellar mass (M\_star)-halo mass relation of galaxies. Our fiducial model reproduces the observed M\_gc-M\_star relation across the full mass range, which we argue is more physically relevant than the M\_gc-M\_halo relation. We also explore the physical processes driving the observed constant value of M\_gc / M\_halo \${\textbackslash}sim 5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ and find that it is the result of a combination of cluster formation physics and cluster disruption.},

At high redshift, where conditions for cluster formation and evolution are more extreme, we are only able to observe the integrated light of a handful of objects that we believe will become globular clusters.

Our focus is how the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) of these \$L{\textasciicircum}*\$ star-forming galaxies change over the last 10 Gyr. We find that the high-\$z\$ {CGM} is almost equally divided between the "cool" (\$T{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}5\$ K) and "hot" (\$T{\textbackslash}geq 10{\textasciicircum}5\$ K) phases, while the low-\$z\$ hot {CGM} phase contains \$5{\textbackslash}times\$ more mass. The high-\$z\$ hot {CGM} contains 60\% more metals than the cool {CGM}, while the low-\$z\$ cool {CGM} contains 35\% more metals than the hot {CGM} content. The metals are evenly distributed radially between the hot and cool phases throughout the high-\$z\$ {CGM}. At high \$z\$, the {CGM} volume is dominated by hot outflows, cool gas is mainly inflowing, but cool metals are flowing outward. At low \$z\$, the cool metals dominate the interior and the hot metals are more prevalent at larger radii. The low-\$z\$ cool {CGM} has tangential motions consistent with rotational support out to \$0.2 R\_\{200\}\$, often exhibiting \$r {\textbackslash}approx 40\$ kpc disc-like structures. The low-\$z\$ hot {CGM} has several times greater angular momentum than the cool {CGM}, and a more flattened radial density profile than the high-\$z\$ hot {CGM}. This study verifies that, just as galaxies demonstrate significant evolutionary stages over cosmic time, the gaseous haloes surrounding them also undergo considerable changes of their own both in physical characteristics of density, temperature and metallicity, and dynamic properties of velocity and angular momentum.},

It strongly disfavors models where the Galaxy has retained the majority of its baryons with a density profile tracking the presumed dark matter density profile. Last, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of larger {FRB} samples to validate our technique and assess the sensitivity of ongoing and future surveys. We recover bounds of several tens \${\textbackslash}text\{pc cm\}{\textasciicircum}3\$ which may be sufficient to test whether the Galaxy has retained a majority of its baryonic mass.

However, for models with realistic thermal and ionization histories the effect of pressure broadening on \${\textbackslash}zeta\$ is weak and sub-dominant compared to other local effects.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05342},
	abstract = {Globular clusters ({GCs}) are typically old, with most having formed at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 2. This makes understanding their birth environments difficult, as they are typically too distant to observe with sufficient angular resolution to resolve {GC} birth sites. Using 25 cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies from the E-{MOSAICS} project, with physically-motivated models for star formation, feedback, and the formation, evolution, and disruption of {GCs}, we identify the birth environments of present-day {GCs}. We find roughly half of {GCs} in these galaxies formed in-situ (52.0 +/- 1.0 per cent) between z {\textasciitilde} 2 - 4, in turbulent, high-pressure discs fed by gas that was accreted without ever being strongly heated through a virial shock or feedback. A minority of {GCs} form during mergers (12.6 +/- 0.6 per cent in major mergers, and 7.2 +/- 0.5 per cent in minor mergers), but we find that mergers are important for preserving the {GCs} seen today by ejecting them from their natal, high density interstellar medium ({ISM}), where proto-{GCs} are rapidly destroyed due to tidal shocks from {ISM} substructure. This chaotic history of hierarchical galaxy assembly acts to mix the spatial and kinematic distribution of {GCs} formed through different channels, making it difficult to use observable {GC} properties to distinguish {GCs} formed in mergers from ones formed by smooth accretion, and similarly {GCs} formed in-situ from those formed ex-situ. These results suggest a simple picture of {GC} formation, in which {GCs} are a natural outcome of normal star formation in the typical, gas-rich galaxies that are the progenitors of present-day galaxies.},

	abstract = {Dekel \& Birnboim06 proposed that the mass-scale that separates late-type and early-type galaxies is linked to the critical halo mass for the propagation of a stable shock and showed that they could reproduce the observed bimodality scale for plausible values of the metallicity of the accreted gas and the shock radius. Here, we take their analysis one step further and present a new semianalytic model that computes the shock radius from first principles. This advancement allows us to compute the critical mass individually for each halo. Separating cold-mode and hot-mode accretion has little effect on the final galaxy masses if feedback does not preferentially couple to the hot gas. We also present an improved model for stellar feedback where 70\% of the wind mass is in a cold galactic fountain with a shorter reaccretion timescale at high masses. The latter is the key mechanism that allows us to reproduce the low-mass end of the mass function of galaxies over the entire redshift range 0{\textless}z{\textless}2.5. Cooling must be mitigated to avoid overpredicting the number density of galaxies with stellar mass greater than a hundred billion Solar masses but is important to form intermediate-mass galaxies. At virial masses greater than three hundred billion Solar masses, cold accretion is more important at high z, where gas is accreted from smaller solid angles, but this is not true at lower masses because high-z filaments have lower metallicities. Our predictions are consistent with the observed metallicity evolution of the intergalactic medium at 0{\textless}z{\textless}5.},

Here we present a new component-level analysis of their ultraviolet ({UV}) kinematic properties using a sample of 31 sightlines through the Magellanic System observed with the Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. Using Voigt profile fits to {UV} metal-line absorption, we quantify the kinematic differences between the low-ion (Si {II} and C {II}), intermediate-ion (Si {III}), and high-ion (Si {IV} and C {IV}) absorption lines and compare the kinematics between the Stream and Leading Arm. We find that the Stream shows generally simple, single-phase kinematics, with statistically indistinguishable b-value distributions for the low-, intermediate-, and high-ion components, all dominated by narrow (b{\textless}25 km/s) components that are well aligned in velocity. In contrast, we find tentative evidence that the Leading Arm shows complex, multi-phase kinematics, with broader high ions than low ions. These results suggest that the Stream is photoionized up to C {IV} by a hard ionizing radiation field. This can be naturally explained by the Seyfert-flare model of Bland-Hawthorn et al. (2013, 2019), in which a burst of ionizing radiation from the Galactic Center photoionized the Stream as it passed below the south Galactic pole. The Seyfert flare is the only known source of radiation that is both powerful enough to explain the H-alpha intensity of the Stream and hard enough to photoionize Si {IV} and C {IV} to the observed levels. The flare's timescale of a few Myr suggests it is the same event that created the giant X-ray/gamma-ray Fermi Bubbles at the Galactic Center.},

In 1914, the American monetary regime changed in two ways: the international gold standard broke down as other countries suspended gold convertibility, and the U.S. gained a central bank in the Federal Reserve system.},

By what mecha- nism does a person experience that “Aha!” moment, when sudden clarity emerges from a tangled web of thoughts and ideas? This research integrates psycho- logical work on insight with graph theoretic work on “small-world” phenomenon, to construct a theory that explains how insight occurs, how it is similar to and different from more typical learning processes, and why it yields an affective response in the individual. I propose that cognitive insight occurs when an atypical association, forged through random recombination or directed search, results in a “shortcut” in an individ- ual’s network of representations. This causes a rapid decrease in path length, reorients the individual’s un- derstanding of the relationships within and among the affected representations, and can prompt a cascade of other connections. This result is demonstrated by ap- plying graph theoretical analysis to network transla- tions of commonly used insight problems.},

It differs from the Negative Binomial Distribution in that lack of success, being a non‐event, is not punished by increased chance of failure. It is shown that such a stochastic law is governed by the Beta Function, containing only one free parameter, and this is approximated by a skew or hyperbolic distribution of the type that is widespread in bibliometrics and diverse social science phenomena. In particular, this is shown to be an appropriate underlying probabilistic theory for the Bradford Law, the Lotka Law, the Pareto and Zipf Distributions, and for all the empirical results of citation frequency analysis. As side results one may derive also the obsolescence factor for literature use. The Beta Function is peculiarly elegant for these manifold purposes because it yields both the actual and the cumulative distributions in simple form, and contains a limiting case of an inverse square law to which many empirical distributions conform.

	abstract = {This account of the Matthew effect is another small exercise in the psychosociological analysis of the workings of science as a social institution. The initial problem is transformed by a shift in theoretical perspective. As originally identified, the Matthew effect was construed in terms of enhancement of the position of already eminent scientists who are given disproportionate credit in cases of collaboration or of independent multiple discoveries. Its significance was thus confined to its implications for the reward system of science. By shifting the angle of vision, we note other possible kinds of consequences, this time for the communication system of science. The Matthew effect may serve to heighten the visibility of contributions to science by scientists of acknowledged standing and to reduce the visibility of contributions by authors who are less well known. We examine the psychosocial conditions and mechanisms underlying this effect and find a correlation between the redundancy function of multiple discoveries and the focalizing function of eminent men of science—a function which is reinforced by the great value these men place upon finding basic problems and by their self-assurance. This self-assurance, which is partly inherent, partly the result of experiences and associations in creative scientific environments, and partly a result of later social validation of their position, encourages them to search out risky but important problems and to highlight the results of their inquiry. A macrosocial version of the Matthew principle is apparently involved in those processes of social selection that currently lead to the concentration of scientific resources and talent (50).},

A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

Sixty years of studies on career productivity patterns in a variety of fields suggest an intuitive and universal pattern: Productivity tends to rise rapidly to an early peak and then gradually declines. Here, we test the universality of this conventional narrative by analyzing the structures of individual faculty productivity time series, constructed from over 200,000 publications and matched with hiring data for 2,453 tenure-track faculty in all 205 {PhD}-granting computer science departments in the United States and Canada. Unlike prior studies, which considered only some faculty or some institutions, or lacked common career reference points, here we combine a large bibliographic dataset with comprehensive information on career transitions that covers an entire field of study. We show that the conventional narrative confidently describes only one-fifth of faculty, regardless of department prestige or researcher gender, and the remaining four-fifths of faculty exhibit a rich diversity of productivity patterns. To explain this diversity, we introduce a simple model of productivity trajectories and explore correlations between its parameters and researcher covariates, showing that departmental prestige predicts overall individual productivity and the timing of the transition from first- to last-author publications. These results demonstrate the unpredictability of productivity over time and open the door for new efforts to understand how environmental and individual factors shape scientific productivity.},

Spectroscopic observations from {HST}-{COS} in the far-ultraviolet reveal a damped absorber with log[N({HI})/cm{\textasciicircum}-2] = 20.10 (-0.21, +0.25) and log[N(H\$\_\{2\}\$)/cm{\textasciicircum}-2] = 18.96 +/- 0.05.

At a metallicity of \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 40\% of solar, there is evidence for Fe enhancement and dust depletion, with a dust-to-gas ratio \${\textbackslash}kappa\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{O\}\} {\textbackslash}approx\$ 0.4.

The closest is a massive, early-type galaxy at d = 41 pkpc which contains 70\% of the total stellar mass identified at d {\textless}= 310 pkpc of the H\$\_\{2\}\$ absorber. The close proximity of the H\$\_\{2\}\$-bearing gas to the quiescent galaxy and the Fe-enhanced chemical abundance pattern of the absorber suggest a physical connection, in contrast to a picture in which {DLAs} are primarily associated with gas-rich dwarfs. This case study illustrates that deep galaxy redshift surveys are needed to gain insight into the diverse environments that host dense and potentially star-forming gas.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11249},
	abstract = {The initial mass function ({IMF}) of stars is a key quantity affecting almost every field of astrophysics, yet it remains unclear what physical mechanisms determine it. We present the first runs of the {STARFORGE} project, using a new numerical framework to follow the formation of individual stars in giant molecular clouds ({GMCs}) using the {GIZMO} code. Our suite include runs with increasingly complex physics, starting with isothermal ideal magnetohydrodynamic ({MHD}) and then adding non-isothermal thermodynamics and protostellar outflows. We show that without protostellar outflows the resulting stellar masses are an order of magnitude too high, similar to the result in the base isothermal {MHD} run. Outflows disrupt the accretion flow around the protostar, allowing gas to fragment and additional stars to form, thereby lowering the mean stellar mass to a value similar to that observed. The effect of jets upon global cloud evolution is most pronounced for lower-mass {GMCs} and dense clumps, so while jets can disrupt low-mass clouds, they are unable to regulate star formation in massive {GMCs}, as they would turn an order unity fraction of the mass into stars before unbinding the cloud. Jets are also unable to stop the runaway accretion of massive stars, which could ultimately lead to the formation of stars with masses \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textgreater}500{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. Although we find that the mass scale set by jets is insensitive to most cloud parameters (i.e., surface density, virial parameter), it is strongly dependent on the momentum loading of the jets (which is poorly constrained by observations) as well the the temperature of the parent cloud, which predicts slightly larger {IMF} variations than observed. We conclude that protostellar jets play a vital role in setting the mass scale of stars, but additional physics are necessary to reproduce the observed {IMF}.},

	abstract = {We present {STARFORGE} ({STAR} {FORmation} in Gaseous Environments): a new numerical framework for 3D radiation {MHD} simulations of star formation that simultaneously follow the formation, accretion, evolution, and dynamics of individual stars in massive giant molecular clouds ({GMCs}) while accounting for stellar feedback, including jets, radiative heating and momentum, stellar winds, and supernovae. We use the {GIZMO} code with the {MFM} mesh-free Lagrangian {MHD} method, augmented with new algorithms for gravity, timestepping, sink particle formation and accretion, stellar dynamics, and feedback coupling. We survey a wide range of numerical parameters/prescriptions for sink formation and accretion and find very small variations in star formation history and the {IMF} (except for intentionally-unphysical variations). Modules for mass-injecting feedback (winds, {SNe}, and jets) inject new gas elements on-the-fly, eliminating the lack of resolution in diffuse feedback cavities otherwise inherent in Lagrangian methods. The treatment of radiation uses {GIZMO}'s radiative transfer solver to track 5 frequency bands ({IR}, optical, {NUV}, {FUV}, ionizing), coupling direct stellar emission and dust emission with gas heating and radiation pressure terms. We demonstrate accurate solutions for {SNe}, winds, and radiation in problems with known similarity solutions, and show that our jet module is robust to resolution and numerical details, and agrees well with previous {AMR} simulations. {STARFORGE} can scale up to massive (\${\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}5 M\_{\textbackslash}odot \$) {GMCs} on current supercomputers while predicting the stellar (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.1 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) range of the {IMF}, permitting simulations of both high- and low-mass cluster formation in a wide range of conditions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03610},
	abstract = {From our position embedded within the Milky Way's interstellar medium ({ISM}), we have limited ability to detect gas at low relative velocities in the extended Galactic halo because those spectral lines are blended with much stronger signals from dense foreground gas. As a result, the content of the Milky Way's circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) is poorly constrained at \${\textbar}v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {LSR}\}{\textbar}\$ \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$ 150 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. To overcome this complication, the {QuaStar} Survey applies a spectral differencing technique using paired quasar-star sightlines to measure the obscured content of the Milky Way's {CGM} for the first time. We present measurements of the {CIV} doublet (\${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}lambda\$ 1548 {\textbackslash}r\{A\}, 1550 {\textbackslash}r\{A\}), a rest-frame {UV} metal line transition detected in {HST}/{COS} spectra of 30 halo-star/quasar pairs evenly distributed across the sky at Galactic latitudes \${\textbar}b{\textbar}{\textgreater}30{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$. The 30 halo stars have well-constrained distances (d\${\textbackslash}approx\$5-14 kpc), and are paired with quasars separated by \${\textless}\$ 2.8\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$. We argue that the difference in absorption between the quasar and stellar sightlines originates primarily in the Milky Way's extended {CGM} beyond \${\textbackslash}sim\$10 kpc. For the Milky Way's extended, low velocity {CGM} (\${\textbar}v{\textbar}{\textless}\$150 km/s), we place an upper limit on the mean {CIV} column density of \${\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}Delta {logN}\_\{{LVCGM}\} {\textless} 13.39\$ and find a covering fraction of \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CIV},{LVCGM}\} ({\textbackslash}rm {logN}{\textgreater}13.65)=\$ 20\% [6/30], a value significantly lower than the covering fraction for star-forming galaxies at low redshift. Our results suggest either that the bulk of Milky Way's {CIV}-traced {CGM} lies at low Galactic latitudes, or that the Milky Way's {CGM} is lacking in warm, ionized material compared to low-redshift (\$z {\textless} 0.1\$) star-forming L* galaxy halos.},

	abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. {NumPy} is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, {NumPy} was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves 1 and in the first imaging of a black hole 2 . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. {NumPy} is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own {NumPy}-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, {NumPy} increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface ({API}), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {The behavior of complex systems is determined not only by the topological organization of their interconnections but also by the dynamical processes taking place among their constituents. A faithful modeling of the dynamics is essential because different dynamical processes may be affected very differently by network topology. A full characterization of such systems thus requires a formalization that encompasses both aspects simultaneously, rather than relying only on the topological adjacency matrix. To achieve this, we introduce the concept of flow graphs, namely weighted networks where dynamical flows are embedded into the link weights. Flow graphs provide an integrated representation of the structure and dynamics of the system, which can then be analyzed with standard tools from network theory. Conversely, a structural network feature of our choice can also be used as the basis for the construction of a flow graph that will then encompass a dynamics biased by such a feature. We illustrate the ideas by focusing on the mathematical properties of generic linear processes on complex networks that can be represented as biased random walks and their dual consensus dynamics, and show how our framework improves our understanding of these processes. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

To understand the role of these factors, we reconstructed the exhibition history of half a million artists, mapping out the coexhibition network that captures the movement of art between institutions. Centrality within this network captured institutional prestige, allowing us to explore the career trajectory of individual artists in terms of access to coveted institutions. Early access to prestigious central institutions offered life-long access to high-prestige venues and reduced dropout rate. By contrast, starting at the network periphery resulted in a high dropout rate, limiting access to central institutions. A Markov model predicts the career trajectory of individual artists and documents the strong path and history dependence of valuation in art.},

	abstract = {One of the most universal trends in science and technology today is the growth of large teams in all areas, as solitary researchers and small teams diminish in prevalence. Increases in team size have been attributed to the specialization of scientific activities, improvements in communication technology, or the complexity of modern problems that require interdisciplinary solutions. This shift in team size raises the question of whether and how the character of the science and technology produced by large teams differs from that of small teams. Here we analyse more than 65 million papers, patents and software products that span the period 1954–2014, and demonstrate that across this period smaller teams have tended to disrupt science and technology with new ideas and opportunities, whereas larger teams have tended to develop existing ones. Work from larger teams builds on more- recent and popular developments, and attention to their work comes immediately. By contrast, contributions by smaller teams search more deeply into the past, are viewed as disruptive to science and technology and succeed further into the future—if at all. Observed differences between small and large teams are magnified for higher- impact work, with small teams known for disruptive work and large teams for developing work. Differences in topic and research design account for a small part of the relationship between team size and disruption; most of the effect occurs at the level of the individual, as people move between smaller and larger teams. These results demonstrate that both small and large teams are essential to a flourishing ecology of science and technology, and suggest that, to achieve this, science policies should aim to support a diversity of team sizes.},

Here, we develop a quantitative understanding of author order by quantifying this “chaperone effect,” capturing how scientists transition into senior status within a particular publication venue. We illustrate that the chaperone effect has a different magnitude for journals in different branches of science, being more pronounced in medical and biological sciences and weaker in natural sciences. Finally, we show that in the case of high-impact venues, the chaperone effect has significant implications, specifically resulting in a higher average impact relative to papers authored by new principal investigators ({PIs}). Our findings shed light on the role played by experience in publishing within specific scientific journals, on the paths toward acquiring the necessary experience and expertise, and on the skills required to publish in prestigious venues.},

	abstract = {The hot streak—loosely defined as ‘winning begets more winnings’—highlights a specific period during which an individual’s performance is substantially better than his or her typical performance. Although hot streaks have been widely debated in sports, gambling and financial markets over the past several decades, little is known about whether they apply to individual careers. Here, building on rich literature on the lifecycle of creativity, we collected large-scale career histories of individual artists, film directors and scientists, tracing the artworks, films and scientific publications they produced. We find that, across all three domains, hit works within a career show a high degree of temporal regularity, with each career being characterized by bursts of high-impact works occurring in sequence. We demonstrate that these observations can be explained by a simple hot-streak model, allowing us to probe quantitatively the hot streak phenomenon governing individual careers. We find this phenomemon to be remarkably universal across diverse domains: hot streaks are ubiquitous yet usually unique across different careers. The hot streak emerges randomly within an individual’s sequence of works, is temporally localized, and is not associated with any detectable change in productivity. We show that, because works produced during hot streaks garner substantially more impact, the uncovered hot streaks fundamentally drive the collective impact of an individual, and ignoring this leads us to systematically overestimate or underestimate the future impact of a career. These results not only deepen our quantitative understanding of patterns that govern individual ingenuity and success, but also may have implications for identifying and nurturing individuals whose work will have lasting impact.},

We find that career movements are not only temporally and spatially localized, but also characterized by a high degree of stratification in institutional ranking. When cross-group movement occurs, we find that while going from elite to lower-rank institutions on average associates with modest decrease in scientific performance, transitioning into elite institutions does not result in subsequent performance gain.

Such a ‘‘socio-economic laboratory’’ allows to unveil the intricate interplay ofspatial constraints, social and economic factors, and patterns ofmobility. We find that the motion of individuals is not only constrained by physical distances, but also strongly shaped by the presence of socio-economic areas.

We analyze the asymptotic behavior of pure populations with different topologies using two kinds of strategic update rules: natural selection, which relies on replicator dynamics, and social penalty, inspired by the Bak-Sneppen dynamics, in which players are subject to a social selection rule penalizing not only the less fit individuals, but also their first neighbors.

	abstract = {Objective To investigate whether language used in science abstracts can skew towards the use of strikingly positive and negative words over time. Design Retrospective analysis of all scientific abstracts in {PubMed} between 1974 and 2014. Methods The yearly frequencies of positive, negative, and neutral words (25 preselected words in each category), plus 100 randomly selected words were normalised for the total number of abstracts. Subanalyses included pattern quantification of individual words, specificity for selected high impact journals, and comparison between author affiliations within or outside countries with English as the official majority language. Frequency patterns were compared with 4\% of all books ever printed and digitised by use of Google Books Ngram Viewer. Main outcome measures Frequencies of positive and negative words in abstracts compared with frequencies of words with a neutral and random connotation, expressed as relative change since 1980. Results The absolute frequency of positive words increased from 2.0\% (1974-80) to 17.5\% (2014), a relative increase of 880\% over four decades. All 25 individual positive words contributed to the increase, particularly the words "robust," "novel," "innovative," and "unprecedented," which increased in relative frequency up to 15 000\%. Comparable but less pronounced results were obtained when restricting the analysis to selected journals with high impact factors. Authors affiliated to an institute in a non-English speaking country used significantly more positive words. Negative word frequencies increased from 1.3\% (1974-80) to 3.2\% (2014), a relative increase of 257\%. Over the same time period, no apparent increase was found in neutral or random word use, or in the frequency of positive word use in published books. Conclusions Our lexicographic analysis indicates that scientific abstracts are currently written with more positive and negative words, and provides an insight into the evolution of scientific writing. Apparently scientists look on the bright side of research results. But whether this perception fits reality should be questioned.},

	abstract = {Contemporary societies are often “polarized”, in the sense that sub-groups within these societies hold stably opposing beliefs, even when there is a fact of the matter. Extant models of polarization do not capture the idea that some beliefs are true and others false. Here we present a model, based on the network epistemology framework of Bala and Goyal (Learning from neighbors, Rev. Econ. Stud.65(3), 784–811 1998), in which polarization emerges even though agents gather evidence about their beliefs, and true belief yields a pay-off advantage. As we discuss, these results are especially relevant to polarization in scientific communities, for these reasons. The key mechanism that generates polarization involves treating evidence generated by other agents as uncertain when their beliefs are relatively different from one’s own.},

We adopt three models for the internal kinematics: isotropic velocities, constant anisotropy and increasingly radial Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy. Analytical solutions are found for the radial dependence of the mass, gravitational potential, velocity dispersion, energy and virial ratio and we test their variability with the concentration parameter describing the density profile and amount of velocity anisotropy. We also compute structural parameters, such as half-mass radius, effective radius and various measures of concentration. Finally, we derive projected quantities, the surface mass density and line-of-sight as well as aperture-velocity dispersion, all of which can be directly applied in observational tests of current scenarios of structure formation. On the mass scales of galaxies, if constant mass-to-light is assumed, the {NFW} surface density profile is found to fit Hubble-Reynolds laws well. It is also well fitted by Sérsic R1/m laws, for m ≃ 3, but in a much narrower range of m and with much larger effective radii than are observed. Assuming in turn reasonable values of the effective radius, the mass density profiles imply a mass-to-light ratio that increases outwards at all radii.},

We decompose the optical emission from diffuse gas into a low- and a high-velocity components. The former is characterised by a clean, regular velocity field and a low ({\textasciitilde}80 km/s) velocity dispersion. It traces regularly rotating gas in {PG} 1126-041, while in {MR} 2251-178 it is possibly associated to tidal debris from a recent merger or flyby. The other component is found to be extended up to a few kpc from the nuclei, and shows a high ({\textasciitilde}800 km/s) velocity dispersion and a blue-shifted mean velocity, as expected from {AGN}-driven outflows. We estimate mass outflow rates up to a few Mo/yr and kinetic efficiencies between 0.1-0.4 per cent, in line with those of galaxies hosting {AGNs} of similar luminosity. The momentum rates of these ionised outflows are comparable to those measured for the {UFOs} at sub-pc scales, consistent with a momentum-driven wind propagation. Pure energy-driven winds are excluded unless about 100x additional momentum is locked in massive molecular winds. By comparing the outflow properties of our sources with those of a small sample of well-studied {QSOs} hosting {UFOs} from the literature, we find that winds seem to systematically lie either in a momentum-driven or in an energy-driven regime, indicating that these two theoretical models bracket very well the physics of {AGN}-driven winds.},

	abstract = {We investigate the spatial structure and evolution of star formation and the interstellar medium ({ISM}) in interacting galaxies. We use an extensive suite of parsec-scale galaxy merger simulations (stellar mass ratio = 2.5:1), which employs the "Feedback In Realistic Environments-" model (fire-2). This framework resolves star formation, feedback processes, and the multi-phase structure of the {ISM}. We focus on the galaxy-pair stages of interaction. We find that close encounters substantially augment cool ({HI}) and cold-dense (H2) gas budgets, elevating the formation of new stars as a result. This enhancement is centrally-concentrated for the secondary galaxy, and more radially extended for the primary. This behaviour is weakly dependent on orbital geometry. We also find that galaxies with elevated global star formation rate ({SFR}) experience intense nuclear {SFR} enhancement, driven by high levels of either star formation efficiency ({SFE}) or available cold-dense gas fuel. Galaxies with suppressed global {SFR} also contain a nuclear cold-dense gas reservoir, but low {SFE} levels diminish {SFR} in the central region. Concretely, in the majority of cases, {SFR}-enhancement in the central kiloparsec is fuel-driven (55\% for the secondary, 71\% for the primary) -- whilst central {SFR}-suppression is efficiency-driven (91\% for the secondary, 97\% for the primary). Our numerical predictions underscore the need of substantially larger, and/or merger-dedicated, spatially-resolved galaxy surveys -- capable of examining vast and diverse samples of interacting systems -- coupled with multi-wavelength campaigns aimed to capture their internal {ISM} structure.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10578},
	abstract = {Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations are increasing their level of realism by considering more physical processes, having more resolution or larger statistics. However, one usually has to either sacrifice the statistical power of such simulations or the resolution reach within galaxies. Here, we introduce the {NewHorizon} project where a zoom-in region of \${\textbackslash}sim(16{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm Mpc){\textasciicircum}3\$, larger than a standard zoom-in region around a single halo, embedded in a larger box is simulated at high resolution. A resolution of up to 34 pc, typical of individual zoom-in resimulated halos is reached within galaxies, allowing the simulation to capture the multi-phase nature of the interstellar medium and the clumpy nature of the star formation process in galaxies. In this introductory paper, we present several key fundamental properties of galaxies and of their black holes including the galaxy mass function, the cosmic star formation rate, the galactic metallicities, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, the stellar-to-halo mass relation, the galaxy sizes, their stellar kinematics and morphology, the gas content within galaxies and its kinematics, and the black hole mass and spin properties over time. The various scaling relations are broadly reproduced by {NewHorizon} with some differences with the standard observables. Due to its exquisite spatial resolution, {NewHorizon} captures the inefficient process of star formation in galaxies, which evolve over time from being more turbulent, gas-rich and star-bursting at high redshift. These high redshift galaxies are also more compact, and are more elliptical and clumpier until the level of internal gas turbulence decays enough to allow for the formation of discs. The {NewHorizon} simulation gives access to a broad range of galaxy physics at low-to-intermediate stellar masses, a regime that will become accessible in the near future through surveys such as the {LSST}.},

	abstract = {(Abridged) Specific angular momentum is one of the key parameters controlling the evolution of galaxies, and it is closely related with the coupling between dark and visible matter. In this work we aim to derive the baryonic specific angular momentum of disc galaxies and study its relation with the dark matter specific angular momentum. Using a combination of high-quality {HI} rotation curves and {HI}/near-{IR} surface densities, we homogeneously measure the stellar (\$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm *\}\$) and gas (\$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gas\}\$) specific angular momentum for a large sample of nearby disc galaxies. This allows us to determine the baryonic specific angular momentum (\$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm bar\}\$) with high accuracy and across a very wide range in mass. We confirm that the \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}-M\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ relation is an unbroken power-law from \$7 {\textbackslash}lesssim\$ log(\$M\_{\textbackslash}ast\$/\$M\_{\textbackslash}odot) {\textbackslash}lesssim 11.5\$, with slope \$0.54 {\textbackslash}pm 0.02\$. Concerning the gas component, we find that the \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gas\}-M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gas\}\$ relation is also an unbroken power-law from \$6 {\textbackslash}lesssim\$ log(\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gas\}\$/\$M\_{\textbackslash}odot) {\textbackslash}lesssim 11\$ with a steeper slope of \$1.01 {\textbackslash}pm 0.04\$. Regarding the baryonic relation, our data supports a correlation characterized by single power-law with slope \$0.58 {\textbackslash}pm 0.02\$. Our analysis shows that our most massive spirals and smallest dwarfs lie along the same \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm bar\}-M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm bar\}\$. While the relations are tight and unbroken, we find internal correlations inside them: at fixed \$M\_{\textbackslash}ast\$, galaxies with larger \$j\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ have larger disc scale lengths, and at fixed \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm bar\}\$, gas-poor galaxies have lower \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm bar\}\$ than expected. We estimate the retained fraction of baryonic specific angular momentum, finding it constant across all our mass range, with a value of 0.7, indicating that the baryonic specific angular momentum of present-day disc galaxies is comparable to the initial specific angular momentum of their dark matter haloes.},

The absorbing gas is associated to an inclined disk-like star-forming galaxy, whose major axis is aligned with the two arc-segments reported here. We probe in absorption the galaxy’s extended disk continuously, at ≈3 kpc sampling, from its inner region out to 15 × the optical radius. We detect strong (\$W\_0{\textasciicircum}\{2796\}{\textgreater}0.3\$ Å) coherent absorption along 13 independent positions at impact parameters D = 0–29 kpc on one side of the galaxy, and no absorption at D = 28–57 kpc on the opposite side (all de-lensed distances at zabs). We show that: (1) the gas distribution is anisotropic; (2) \$W\_0{\textasciicircum}\{2796\}\$, \$W\_0{\textasciicircum}\{2600\}\$, \$W\_0{\textasciicircum}\{2852\}\$, and the ratio \$W\_0{\textasciicircum}\{2600\}{\textbackslash}!/W\_0{\textasciicircum}\{2796\}\$, all anti-correlate with D; (3) the \$W\_0{\textasciicircum}\{2796\}\$-D relation is not cuspy and exhibits significantly less scatter than the quasar-absorber statistics; (4) the absorbing gas is co-rotating with the galaxy out to D ≲ 20 kpc, resembling a ‘flat’ rotation curve, but at D ≳ 20 kpc velocities decline below the expectations from a 3D disk-model extrapolated from the nebular [O ii] emission. These signatures constitute unambiguous evidence for rotating extra-planar diffuse gas, possibly also undergoing enriched accretion at its edge. Arguably, we are witnessing some of the long-sought processes of the baryon cycle in a single distant galaxy expected to be representative of such phenomena.},

These metallicities and the system's large velocity width (\$436\$ km\${\textbackslash},\$s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) suggest the gas is produced by an outflowing wind. Using an expanding shell model we estimate a mass outflow rate of \${\textbackslash}sim5 M\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textbackslash},\$yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Our photoionization model yields extremely small sizes (\${\textless}\$100-500 pc) for the absorbing clouds, which we argue are typical of high column density absorbers in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}). Given these small sizes and extreme kinematics, it is unclear how the clumps survive in the {CGM} without being destroyed by hydrodynamic instabilities. The small cloud sizes imply that even state-of-the-art cosmological simulations require more than a \$1000\$-fold improvement in mass resolution to resolve the hydrodynamics relevant for cool gas in the {CGM}.},

The cross-correlation is clearly detected on scales up to 40 Mpc/h and is well fitted by the linear theory prediction of the standard Cold Dark Matter model of structure formation with the expected redshift distortions, confirming its origin in the gravitational evolution of structure. The amplitude of the {DLA}-Lyman alpha cross-correlation depends on only one free parameter, the bias factor of the {DLA} systems, once the Lyman alpha forest bias factors are known from independent Lyman alpha forest correlation measurements. We measure the {DLA} bias factor to be b\_D = (2.17 +/- 0.20) beta\_F{\textasciicircum}\{0.22\}, where the Lyman alpha forest redshift distortion parameter beta\_F is expected to be above unity. This bias factor implies a typical host halo mass for {DLAs} that is much larger than expected in present {DLA} models, and is reproduced if the {DLA} cross section scales with halo mass as M\_h{\textasciicircum}alpha, with alpha= 1.1 +/- 0.1 for beta\_F=1. Matching the observed {DLA} bias factor and rate of incidence requires that atomic gas remains extended in massive halos over larger areas than predicted in present simulations of galaxy formation, with typical {DLA} proper sizes larger than 20 kpc in host halos of masses {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}12 solar masses. We infer that typical galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 2 to 3 are surrounded by systems of atomic clouds that are much more extended than the luminous parts of galaxies and contain {\textasciitilde} 10\% of the baryons in the host halo.},

	abstract = {We present tomography of the circum-galactic metal distribution at redshift 1.7-4.5 derived from echellete spectroscopy of binary quasars. We find Civ systems at similar redshifts in paired sightlines more often than expected for sightline-independent redshifts. As the separation of the sightlines increases from 36 kpc to 907 kpc, the amplitude of this clustering decreases. At the largest separations, the C iv systems cluster similar to the Lyman-break galaxies studied by Adelberger et al. in 2005. The C iv systems are significantly less correlated than these galaxies, however, at separations less than R1 ≃ 0.42 ± 0.15 h-1 {comovingMpc}. Measured in real space, i.e., transverse to the sightlines, this length scale is significantly smaller than the break scale estimated previously from the line-of-sight correlation function in redshift space by Scannapieco et al. in 2006. Using a simple model, we interpret the new real-space measurement as an indication of the typical physical size of enriched regions.We adopt this size for enriched regions and fit the redshift-space distortion in the line-of-sight correlation function. The fitted velocity kick is consistent with the peculiar velocity of galaxies as determined by the underlying mass distribution and places an upper limit on the average outflow (or inflow) speed of metals. The implied timescale for dispersing metals is larger than the typical stellar ages of Lyman-break galaxies, and we argue that enrichment by galaxies at z {\textgreater} 4.3 played a greater role in dispersing metals. To further constrain the growth of enriched regions, we discuss empirical constraints on the evolution of the C iv correlation function with cosmic time. This study demonstrates the potential of tomography for measuring the metal enrichment history of the circum-galactic medium. ©2010. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The correlation between Lyman-alpha absorption in the spectra of quasar pairs can be used to measure the transverse distance scale at z{\textasciitilde}2, which is sensitive to the cosmological constant (Omega\_Lambda) or other forms of vacuum energy. Using Hydro-{PM} simulations, I compute the three-dimensional power spectrum of the Lyman-alpha forest flux, P\_F(k,mu), from which the redshift-space anisotropy of the correlation can be obtained. I find that box size {\textasciitilde}40 Mpc/h and resolution {\textasciitilde}40 Kpc/h are necessary for convergence of the calculations to {\textless}5\% on all relevant scales, although somewhat poorer resolution can be used for large scales. I compute directly the linear theory bias parameters of the Lyman-alpha forest, potentially allowing simulation results to be extended to arbitrarily large scales. I investigate the dependence of P\_F(k,mu) on the primordial power spectrum, the temperature-density relation of the gas, and the mean flux decrement, finding that the redshift-space anisotropy is relatively insensitive to these parameters. A table of results is provided for different parameter variations. I investigate the constraint that can be obtained on Omega\_Lambda using quasars from a large survey. Assuming 13 (theta/1'){\textasciicircum}2 pairs at separation {\textless}theta, and including separations {\textless}10', a measurement to {\textless}5\% can be made if simulations can predict the redshift-space anisotropy with {\textless}5\% accuracy, or to {\textless}10\% if the anisotropy must be measured from the data. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS}) will obtain spectra for a factor {\textasciitilde}5 fewer pairs than this, so followup observations of fainter pair candidates will be necessary. I discuss the requirements on spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio ({SDSS}-quality spectra are sufficient).},

From every measurement and test in this work, we find evidence for an overdensity of {LBGs} near {DLAs} that is very similar to that of {LBGs} near other {LBGs}. Conventional binning of the data while varying both r0 and γ parameters of the fiducial model of the correlation function ξ(r)=(r/r0)-γ resulted in the best-fit values and 1 σ uncertainties of r0=2.65+/-0.48, γ=1.55+/-0.40 for the {LBG} autocorrelation, and r0=3.32+/-1.25, γ=1.74+/-0.36 for the {DLA}-{LBG} cross-correlation function. To circumvent shortcomings found in binning small data sets, we perform a maximum likelihood analysis based on Poisson statistics. The best-fit values and 1 σ confidence levels were found to be r0=2.91+1.0-1.0, γ=1.21+0.6-0.3 for the {LBG} autocorrelation, and r0=2.81+1.4-2.0, γ=2.11+1.3-1.4 for the {DLA}-{LBG} cross-correlation function. We report a redshift spike of five {LBGs} with Δz=0.015 of the z=2.936 {DLA} in the {PSS} 0808+5215 field; the {DLA}-{LBG} clustering signal survives when omitting this field from the analysis. Using the correlation function measurements and uncertainties, we compute the z{\textasciitilde}3 {LBG} galaxy bias {bLBG} to be 1.5{\textless}{bLBG}{\textless}3, corresponding to an average halo mass of 109.7{\textless}{\textless}{MLBG}{\textgreater}{\textless}1011.6 Msolar, and the z{\textasciitilde}3 {DLA} galaxy bias {bDLA} to be 1.3{\textless}{bDLA}{\textless}4, corresponding to an average halo mass of 109{\textless}{\textless}{MLBG}{\textgreater}{\textless}1012 Msolar. Finally, two of the six {QSOs} discovered were found to lie within Δz=0.0125 of two of the survey {DLAs}. We estimate that the probability of this occurring by chance is 1 in 940, indicating a possible relationship between the distribution of {QSOs} and {DLAs} at z{\textasciitilde}3.},

We use a sample of 650 projected quasar pairs to study the H I Lyα absorption transverse to luminous, z ∼ 2 quasars at proper separations of 30 kpc {\textless} R ⊥ {\textless} 1 Mpc. In contrast to measurements along the line-of-sight, regions transverse to quasars exhibit enhanced H I Lyα absorption and a larger variance than the ambient intergalactic medium, with increasing absorption and variance toward smaller scales. Analysis of composite spectra reveals excess absorption characterized by a Lyα equivalent width profile W = 2.3 Å (R ⊥/100 kpc)-0.46. We also observe a high (≃ 60\%) covering factor of strong, optically thick H I absorbers (H I column ) at separations R ⊥ {\textless} 200 kpc, which decreases to ∼20\% at R ⊥ ≃ 1 Mpc, but still represents a significant excess over the cosmic average. This excess of optically thick absorption can be described by a quasar-absorber cross-correlation function ξ{QA}(r) = (r/r 0)γ with a large correlation length (comoving) and . The H I absorption measured around quasars exceeds that of any previously studied population, consistent with quasars being hosted by massive dark matter halos M halo ≈ 1012.5 M⊙ at z ∼ 2.5. The environments of these massive halos are highly biased toward producing optically thick gas, and may even dominate the cosmic abundance of Lyman limit systems and hence the intergalactic opacity to ionizing photons at z ∼ 2.5. The anisotropic absorption around quasars implies the transverse direction is much less likely to be illuminated by ionizing radiation than the line-of-sight. © 2013.

The cross-correlation is detected over a wide range of scales, up to comoving separations r of 80 Mpc/h. For r {\textgreater} 15 Mpc/h, we show that the cross-correlation is well fitted by the linear theory prediction for the mean overdensity around a quasar host halo in the standard {\textbackslash}Lambda {CDM} model, with the redshift distortions indicative of gravitational evolution detected at high confidence. Using previous determinations of the Lyman {\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash} forest bias factor obtained from the Lyman {\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash} autocorrelation, we infer the quasar bias factor to be b\_q = 3.64{\textasciicircum}+0.13\_-0.15 at a mean redshift z=2.38, in agreement with previous measurements from the quasar auto-correlation. We also obtain a new estimate of the Lyman {\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash} forest redshift distortion factor, {\textbackslash}beta\_F = 1.1 +/- 0.15, slightly larger than but consistent with the previous measurement from the Lyman {\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash} forest autocorrelation. The simple linear model we use fails at separations r {\textless} 15 Mpc/h, and we show that this may reasonably be due to the enhanced ionization due to radiation from the quasars.

We perform a kinematic comparison of these galaxies and their associated halo {MgII} absorption. For all 10 galaxies, the majority of the absorption velocities lie in the range of the observed galaxy rotation velocities. In 7/10 cases, the absorption velocities reside fully to one side of the galaxy systemic velocity and usually align with one arm of the rotation curve. In all cases, a constant rotating thick-disk model poorly reproduces the full spread of observed {MgII} absorption velocities when reasonably realistic parameters are employed. In 2/10 cases, the galaxy kinematics, star formation surface densities, and absorption kinematics have a resemblance to those of high redshift galaxies showing strong outflows. We find that {MgII} absorption velocity spread and optical depth distribution may be dependent on galaxy inclination. To further aid in the spatial-kinematic relationships of the data, we apply quasar absorption line techniques to a galaxy (v\_c=180 km/s) embedded in {LCDM} simulations. In the simulations, {MgII} absorption selects metal enriched "halo" gas out to roughly 100 kpc from the galaxy, tidal streams, filaments, and small satellite galaxies. Within the limitations inherent in the simulations, the majority of the simulated {MgII} absorption arises in the filaments and tidal streams and is infalling towards the galaxy with velocities between -200 {\textless} v\_r {\textless} -180 km/s. The {MgII} absorption velocity offset distribution (relative to the simulated galaxy) spans {\textasciitilde}200 km/s with the lowest frequency of detecting {MgII} at the galaxy systematic velocity.},

For comparison we measure the same quantity around luminous red galaxies ({LRGs}). On scales greater than 100 kpc both {ELGs} and {LRGs} exhibit similar absorption profiles. However, metal absorption is 5-10 times stronger around {ELGs} on smaller scales. The metal absorption strength is anisotropic, with an excess along the minor-axis of the galaxies, indicating an outflow origin of the absorbing gas. The ratio between the velocity dispersion of the cool {CGM} and that of its host dark matter halo is about one for {ELGs} but about half for {LRGs}. These results show that the dichotomy of galaxy types is reflected in both the density distribution and kinematics of the {CGM} traced by metal absorption lines. Our results provide strong evidence that the {CGM} of {ELGs} is enriched by gas outflows generated by star formation.},

We consider physical effects that control the motion and mass loss of the clouds, and estimate the lifetime and the observed properties of individual cool gas clouds inferred from the {CLOUDY} simulation. Our results show that the cool pressure-confined gas clouds have physical properties consistent with absorption line systems with neutral hydrogen column densities \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {HI}\}{\textbackslash}geq10{\textasciicircum}\{18.5\} {\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ such as strong metal absorbers, sub-{DLAs}, and {DLAs}. The cool circumgalactic clouds are transient due to evaporation and recycling and therefore a constant replenishment is needed to maintain the cool {CGM}. We further model the ensemble properties of the cool {CGM} with clouds originated from outflows, inflows, or/and in-situ formation with a range of initial cloud mass function and velocity distribution. We find that only with a certain combination of parameters, an outflow model can broadly reproduce three cool gas properties around star-forming galaxies simultaneously: the spatial distribution, down-the-barrel outflow absorption, and gas velocity dispersion. Both a constant insitu model and gas inflow model can reproduce the observed covering fractions of high \${\textbackslash}rm N\_\{{HI}\}\$ gas around passive galaxies but they fail to reproduce sufficient number of low \${\textbackslash}rm N\_\{{HI}\}\$ systems. The limitations and the failures of the current models are discussed.

By doing so, we extract the properties of galaxies associated with absorbers from redshift 0.4 to 1.3 with effectively \${\textbackslash}sim 15,000\$ pairs and explore the covering fraction of {MgII} absorbers as a function of galaxy type, stellar mass, impact parameter, and redshift. We find that the gas covering fraction increases with stellar mass of galaxies by \${\textbackslash}sim M\_\{*\}{\textasciicircum}\{0.4\}\$. However, after we normalize the impact parameter by the virial radius of dark matter halos, the gas profiles around galaxies with masses ranging from \$10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ become weakly dependent on stellar mass. In addition, the gas distribution depends on galaxy type: the covering fraction within \$0.3 {\textbackslash}, r\_\{vir\}\$ around star-forming galaxies is 2-4 times higher than that around passive galaxies at all redshifts. We find that the covering fraction of strong absorbers (\$W\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda2796\}{\textgreater}1\$ Angstrom) around both types of galaxies evolves significantly with redshift, similarly to the evolution of star-formation rate of galaxies, while such an evolution is not detected for weak absorbers (\$W\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda2796\}{\textless}1\$ Angstrom). We quantify the {HI} mass traced by strong absorbers and find that the gas mass around galaxies evolves consistently with the star-formation rate of galaxies. This result suggests that the properties of galaxies and their {CGM} co-evolve through cosmic time. Finally, we discuss the origins of strong absorbers around passive galaxies and argue that its redshift evolution may trace the star-formation activity of satellite galaxies.},

	abstract = {We explore the origin of stellar metallicity gradients in simulated and observed dwarf galaxies. We use {FIRE}-2 cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations of 26 isolated galaxies as well as existing observational data for 10 Local Group dwarf galaxies. Our simulated galaxies have stellar masses between \$10{\textasciicircum}\{5.5\}\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}\{8.6\} {\textbackslash}msun\$. We find that stellar metallicity gradients are common in our simulations, with central regions tending to be more metal-rich than the outer parts. The strength of the gradient is correlated with galaxy-wide median stellar age, such that galaxies with younger stellar populations have flatter gradients. The strengths of these gradients are set by two competing processes: (1) the steady "puffing" of old, metal-poor stars by feedback-driven potential fluctuations, and (2) extended, late-time star formation. Late-time star formation tends to be metal rich, so galaxies with significant late-time star formation will mitigate the gradients formed by the "puffing" process. We use published results from ten Local Group dwarf galaxies to show that our predicted relationship between age and stellar metallicity-gradient strength is consistent with existing observations. This suggests that observed stellar metallicity gradients may be driven largely by the baryon/feedback cycle rather than by external environmental effects.},

	abstract = {With the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer ({MUSE}), it is now possible to detect spatially extended Lyman alpha emission from individual faint (M\_UV {\textasciitilde} -18) galaxies at redshifts, 3 {\textless} z {\textless} 6, tracing gas out to circum-galactic scales comparable to the dark matter halo virial radius. To explore the implications of such observations, we present a cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation of a single galaxy, chosen to be typical of the Lyman alpha-emitting galaxies detected by {MUSE} in deep fields. We use this simulation to study the origin and dynamics of the high-redshift circum-galactic medium ({CGM}). We find that the majority of the mass in the diffuse {CGM} is comprised of material infalling for the first time towards the halo center, but with the inner {CGM} also containing a comparable amount of mass that has moved past first-pericentric passage, and is in the process of settling into a rotationally supported configuration. Making the connection to Lyman alpha emission, we find that the observed extended surface brightness profile is due to a combination of three components: scattering of galactic Lyman alpha emission in the {CGM}, in-situ emission of {CGM} gas (mostly infalling), and Lyman alpha emission from small satellite galaxies. The weight of these contributions vary with distance from the galaxy such that (1) scattering dominates the inner regions (r {\textless} 7 kpc), at surface brightness larger than a few 10{\textasciicircum}-19 cgs, (2) all components contribute equally around r {\textasciitilde} 10 kpc (or {SB} {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}-19), and (3) the contribution of small satellite galaxies takes over at large distances (or {SB} {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}-20). Our simulation fails to reproduce the characteristic observed Lyman alpha spectral morphology that is red-shifted with respect to the systemic velocity, with the implication that the simulation is missing an important component of neutral outflowing gas.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12302},
	abstract = {Radiative mixing layers arise wherever multiphase gas, shear, and radiative cooling are present. Simulations show that in steady state, thermal advection from the hot phase balances radiative cooling in the front. However, many features are puzzling. For instance, hot gas entrainment appears to be numerically converged despite the scale-free, fractal structure of such fronts implying that they should be unresolved. Additionally, the hot gas heat flux has a characteristic velocity \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm in\} {\textbackslash}approx c\_\{{\textbackslash}rm s,c\} (t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sc,c\}){\textasciicircum}\{-1/4\}\$ whose strength and scaling are not intuitive. We revisit these issues in 1D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations. Low resolution leads to numerical diffusion (from truncation error) and dispersion (from stiff source terms). We find that over-cooling only happens if numerical diffusion dominates thermal transport; convergence is still possible even when the Field length is unresolved. A deeper physical understanding of radiative fronts can be obtained by exploiting parallels between mixing layers and turbulent combustion, which has well-developed theory and abundant experimental data. A key parameter is the Damkohler number \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Da\} = {\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm turb\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}\$, the ratio of the outer eddy turnover time to the cooling time. Once \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Da\} {\textgreater} 1\$, the front fragments into a multiphase medium. Just as for scalar mixing, the eddy turnover time sets the mixing rate, independent of small scale diffusion. For this reason, thermal conduction often has limited impact. We show that \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm in\}\$ and the effective emissivity can be understood in detail by adapting combustion theory scalings. Mean density and temperature profiles can also be reproduced well by mixing length theory. These results have implications for the structure and survival of cold gas in many settings, and resolution requirements for large scale galaxy simulations.},

We predict the vast majority of nearby galaxies will be observable given the surface brightness limits of the Vera Rubin Observatory's co-added Legacy Survey of Space and Time ({LSST}). We additionally show that faint dwarfs with velocity dispersions \${\textbackslash}lesssim5\$ km/s result from severe tidal stripping of the host halo. These simulations allow us to investigate quenching of {UFDs} in a hydrodynamical Milky Way context for the first time. We find that the majority of the {UFDs} are quenched prior to interactions with the Milky Way, though some of the quenched {UFDs} retain their gas until infall. Additionally these simulations yield some unique dwarfs that are the first of their kind to be simulated, e.g., an {HI}-rich field {UFD}, a late-forming {UFD} that has structural properties similar to Crater 2, as well as a compact dwarf satellite that has no dark matter at \$z=0\$.},

Angle-averaged measurements of clustering yield constraints on the quantity However, to break the degeneracy between these two parameters one must measure the anisotropic clustering as a function of both line-of-sight (radial) and transverse separations. Here we investigate how to most effectively do so, using analytic techniques and mock catalogues. In particular, we examine multipole expansions of the correlation function and introduce 'clustering wedges'ξ(Δμ, s), where μ=s ∥/s and s ∥ is the radial component of separation s. Both techniques allow strong constraints on H and D A, as expected. The radial wedges strongly depend on H and the transverse wedges are sensitive to D A. When analysing the full shape of ξ, we find similar constraints when using the clustering wedges and the monopole-quadrupole pair. We find additional improvement when using the hexadecapole, as previously mentioned in the literature. Our findings here demonstrate that wedge statistics provide a practical alternative technique to multipoles, which should be useful to test systematics and will provide comparable constraints. © 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2011 {RAS}.},

	abstract = {We study the luminosity and color dependence of the galaxy 2-point correlation function in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, starting from a sample of 200,000 galaxies over 2500 deg{\textasciicircum}2. We concentrate on the projected correlation function w(r\_p), which is directly related to the real space {\textbackslash}xi(r). The amplitude of w(r\_p) grows continuously with luminosity, rising more steeply above the characteristic luminosity L\_*. Redder galaxies exhibit a higher amplitude and steeper correlation function at all luminosities. The correlation amplitude of blue galaxies increases continuously with luminosity, but the luminosity dependence for red galaxies is less regular, with bright red galaxies more strongly clustered at large scales and faint red galaxies more strongly clustered at small scales. We interpret these results using halo occupation distribution ({HOD}) models assuming concordance cosmological parameters. For most samples, an {HOD} model with two adjustable parameters fits the w(r\_p) data better than a power-law, explaining inflections at r\_p {\textasciitilde} 1-3 Mpc/h as the transition between the 1-halo and 2-halo regimes of {\textbackslash}xi(r). The implied minimum mass for a halo hosting a central galaxy above a luminosity threshold L grows as M\_min {\textasciitilde} L at low luminosities and more steeply above L\_*. The mass at which an average halo has one satellite galaxy brighter than L is M\_1 {\textasciitilde} 23 M\_min(L). These results imply a conditional luminosity function (at fixed halo mass) in which central galaxies lie far above a Schechter function extrapolation of the satellite population. {HOD} models nicely explain the joint luminosity-color dependence of w(r\_p) in terms of the color fractions of central and satellite populations as a function of halo mass. The inferred {HOD} properties are in good qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions.},

Our combined galaxy sample comprises 1.2 million massive galaxies over an effective area of 9329 deg{\textasciicircum}2 and volume of 18.7 Gpc{\textasciicircum}3, divided into three partially overlapping redshift slices centred at effective redshifts 0.38, 0.51, and 0.61. We measure the angular diameter distance {DM} and Hubble parameter H from the baryon acoustic oscillation ({BAO}) method after applying reconstruction to reduce non-linear effects on the {BAO} feature. Using the anisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction density field, we measure the product {DM}*H from the Alcock-Paczynski ({AP}) effect and the growth of structure, quantified by f\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}8(z), from redshift-space distortions ({RSD}). We combine measurements presented in seven companion papers into a set of consensus values and likelihoods, obtaining constraints that are tighter and more robust than those from any one method. Combined with Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously imply curvature \{{\textbackslash}Omega\}\_K =0.0003+/-0.0026 and a dark energy equation of state parameter w = -1.01+/-0.06, in strong affirmation of the spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant (\{{\textbackslash}Lambda\}{CDM}). Our {RSD} measurements of f\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}\_8, at 6 per cent precision, are similarly consistent with this model. When combined with supernova Ia data, we find H0 = 67.3+/-1.0 km/s/Mpc even for our most general dark energy model, in tension with some direct measurements. Adding extra relativistic species as a degree of freedom loosens the constraint only slightly, to H0 = 67.8+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc. Assuming flat \{{\textbackslash}Lambda\}{CDM} we find \{{\textbackslash}Omega\}\_m = 0.310+/-0.005 and H0 = 67.6+/-0.5 km/s/Mpc, and we find a 95\% upper limit of 0.16 {eV}/c{\textasciicircum}2 on the neutrino mass sum.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we take advantage of the {GAlaxy} Evolution and Assembly ({GAEA}) semi-analytic model to analyse the origin of secondary dependencies in the local galaxy mass - gas metallicity relation. Our model reproduces quite well the trends observed in the local Universe as a function of galaxy star formation rate and different gas-mass phases. We show that the cold gas content (whose largest fraction is represented by the atomic gas phase) can be considered as the third parameter governing the scatter of the predicted mass-metallicity relation, in agreement with the most recent observational measurements. The trends can be explained with fluctuations of the gas accretion rates: a decrease of the gas supply leads to an increase of the gas metallicity due to star formation, while an increase of the available cold gas leads to a metallicity depletion. We demonstrate that the former process is responsible for offsets above the mass-metallicity relation, while the latter is responsible for deviations below the mass-metallicity relation. In low and intermediate mass galaxies, these negative offsets are primarily determined by late gas cooling dominated by material that has been previously ejected due to stellar feedback.},

	abstract = {Cosmological N-body simulations have been a major tool of theorists for decades, yet many of the numerical issues that these simulations face are still unexplored. This paper measures numerical biases in these large, dark matter-only simulations that affect the properties of their dark matter haloes. We compare many simulation suites in order to provide several tools for simulators and analysts which help mitigate these biases. We summarise our comparisons with practical `convergence limits' that can be applied to a wide range of halo properties, including halo properties which are traditionally overlooked by the testing literature. We also find that the halo properties predicted by different simulations can diverge from one another at unexpectedly high resolutions. We demonstrate that many halo properties depend strongly on force softening scale and that this dependence leads to much of the measured divergence between simulations. We offer an empirical model to estimate the impact of such effects on the rotation curves of a halo population. This model can serve as a template for future empirical models of the biases in other halo properties.},

	abstract = {Understanding the rate at which stars form is central to studies of galaxy formation. Observationally, the star formation rates ({SFRs}) of galaxies are measured using the luminosity in different frequency bands, often under the assumption of a time-steady {SFR} in the recent past. We use star formation histories ({SFHs}) extracted from cosmological simulations of star-forming galaxies from the {FIRE} project to analyze the time-scales to which the H\$\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ and far-ultraviolet ({FUV}) continuum {SFR} indicators are sensitive. In these simulations, the {SFRs} are highly time variable for all galaxies at high redshift, and continue to be bursty to z=0 in dwarf galaxies. When {FIRE} {SFHs} are partitioned into their bursty and time-steady phases, the best-fitting {FUV} time-scale fluctuates from its {\textasciitilde}10 Myr value when the {SFR} is time-steady to {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}100 Myr immediately following particularly extreme bursts of star formation during the bursty phase. On the other hand, the best-fitting averaging time-scale for H\$\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ is generally insensitive to the {SFR} variability in the {FIRE} simulations and remains {\textasciitilde}5 Myr at all times. These time-scales are shorter than the 100 Myr and 10 Myr time-scales sometimes assumed in the literature for {FUV} and H\$\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$, respectively, because while the {FUV} emission persists for stellar populations older than 100 Myr, the time-dependent luminosities are strongly dominated by younger stars. Our results confirm that the ratio of {SFRs} inferred using H\$\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ vs. {FUV} can be used to probe the burstiness of star formation in galaxies.},

The {CGM}\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ spectroscopic survey consists of 1689 galaxies, all with high-quality Gemini {GMOS} spectra suitable for precise redshift measurements, within 1 Mpc of twenty-two \$z {\textbackslash}lesssim 1\$ quasars, all with existing S/N\${\textbackslash}sim\$10 {HST}-{COS} G130M\$+\$G160M spectra.

We examine the kinematics of the {HI} absorption relative to the galaxy systemic velocities and find that the majority of absorption lies within \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 250 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, and that this concentration increases with increasing {HI} column density from \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {HI}\}\$ \$=10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} - 10{\textasciicircum}\{17\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$. We examine {HI} covering fractions over a range of impact parameters to infer a characteristic size of the {CGM}, \$R{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CGM}\}\$, as a function of galaxy mass. \$R{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CGM}\}\$ is the impact parameter at which the probability of observing an absorber with \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {HI}\}\$ \${\textgreater}\$ 10\${\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ is \${\textgreater}\$ 50\%. In this framework, the radial extent of the {CGM} of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ galaxies is \$R{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CGM}\} = 362\_\{-72\}{\textasciicircum}\{+83\}\$ kpc or \$R{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CGM}\} = 1.4R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$. Lower-mass galaxies show a smaller physical scale \$R{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CGM}\} = 281\_\{-36\}{\textasciicircum}\{+42\}\$ kpc but extend to \$R{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {CGM}\} = 2.3R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$. Our analysis suggests that using \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$ as a proxy for the characteristic radius of the {CGM} likely underestimates its extent, especially for galaxies with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$.},

We use three different galaxy formation models, each with and without magnetic fields, and include additional spatial refinement in the {CGM} to improve its resolution. The central galaxy's star formation rate and stellar mass are not strongly affected by the presence of magnetic fields, but the galaxy is more disc-dominated and its central black hole is more massive when \$B{\textgreater}0\$. The physical properties of the {CGM} change significantly. With magnetic fields, the gas fraction and metal mass fraction in the halo are higher, the atomic hydrogen-dominated extended discs around the galaxy are more massive, the circumgalactic gas flows are slower, the densities in the inner {CGM} are higher, the temperatures in the outer {CGM} are higher, the pressure in the halo is higher, and the metals are less well-mixed throughout the halo. Additionally, we find that the {CGM} properties depend on azimuthal angle and that magnetic fields reduce the scatter in radial velocity, whilst enhancing the scatter in metallicity at fixed azimuthal angle. These results together show that magnetic fields in the {CGM} change the flow of gas in galaxy haloes, making it more difficult for metal-rich outflows to mix with the metal-poor {CGM} and to escape the halo, and therefore should be included in simulations of galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {Fast radio bursts ({FRBs}) can be scattered by ionized gas in their local environments, host galaxies, intervening galaxies along their lines-of-sight, the intergalactic medium, and the Milky Way. The relative contributions of these different media depend on their geometric configuration and the internal properties of the gas. When these relative contributions are well understood, {FRB} scattering is a powerful probe of density fluctuations along the line-of-sight. Using {FRB} 121102 and {FRB} 180916 as case studies, we place an upper limit on the amount of scattering contributed by the Milky Way halo to {FRBs}. The scattering time \${\textbackslash}tau {\textbackslash}propto ({\textbackslash}tilde\{F\} {\textbackslash}times \{{\textbackslash}rm {DM}\}{\textasciicircum}2) A\_{\textbackslash}tau\$, where {DM} is the dispersion measure, \${\textbackslash}tilde\{F\}\$ quantifies electron density variations with \${\textbackslash}tilde\{F\}=0\$ for a smooth medium, and the dimensionless constant \$A\_{\textbackslash}tau\$ quantifies the difference between the mean scattering delay and the \$1/e\$ scattering time typically measured. Using a likelihood analysis we find \$({\textbackslash}tilde\{F\} {\textbackslash}times \{{\textbackslash}rm {DM}\}{\textasciicircum}2)\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {MW}, halo\} {\textless} 250/A\_{\textbackslash}tau\$ pc\${\textasciicircum}\{4/3\}\$ km\${\textasciicircum}\{-1/3\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-1/3\}\$. For an assumed halo \${\textbackslash}widehat\{\{{\textbackslash}rm {DM}\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {MW}, halo\} = 60 {\textbackslash}pm 18\$ pc cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ we obtain \${\textbackslash}tilde\{F\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {MW},halo\}{\textless}0.03/A\_{\textbackslash}tau\$ pc\${\textasciicircum}\{-2/3\}\$ km\${\textasciicircum}\{-1/3\}\$. By contrast, pulsar scattering and {DMs} imply \${\textbackslash}tilde\{F\} {\textbackslash}sim0.1\$ pc\${\textasciicircum}\{-2/3\}\$ km\${\textasciicircum}\{-1/3\}\$ for the Galactic thin disk and \${\textbackslash}tilde\{F\}{\textbackslash}sim0.001\$ pc\${\textasciicircum}\{-2/3\}\$ km\${\textasciicircum}\{-1/3\}\$ for the thick disk. The maximum pulse broadening from the halo is \${\textbackslash}tau {\textbackslash}lesssim 12\$ \${\textbackslash}mu\$s at 1 {GHz}. We compare our analysis of the Milky Way halo with other galaxy haloes by placing limits on the scattering contributions from haloes intersecting the lines-of-sight to {FRB} 181112 and {FRB} 191108. Our results are consistent with haloes making negligible or very small contributions to the scattering times of {FRBs}.},

Combining {kSZ} and {tSZ} measurements, we measure within our model the amplitude of energy injection \${\textbackslash}epsilon M\_{\textbackslash}star c{\textasciicircum}2\$, where \$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$ is the stellar mass, to be \${\textbackslash}epsilon=(33{\textasciicircum}\{+2\}\_\{-5\}){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$, and the amplitude of the non-thermal pressure profile to be \${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Nth\}=0.30{\textasciicircum}\{+0.06\}\_\{-0.07\}\$, indicating that 30\% of the total pressure within the virial radius is due to a non-thermal component. We estimate the effects of including baryons in the modeling of weak-lensing galaxy cross-correlation measurements using the best fit density profile from the {kSZ} measurement. Our estimate reduces the difference between the original theoretical model and the weak-lensing galaxy cross-correlation measurements in {arXiv}:1611.08606 by half (50\% at most), but does not fully reconcile it. Comparing the {kSZ} and {tSZ} measurements to cosmological simulations, we find that they under predict the {CGM} pressure and to a lesser extent the {CGM} density at larger radii. This suggests that the energy injected via feedback models in the simulations that we compared against does not sufficiently heat the gas at these radii. We do not find significant disagreement at smaller radii. These measurements provide novel tests of current and future simulations. This work demonstrates the power of joint, high signal-to-noise {kSZ} and {tSZ} observations, upon which future cross-correlation studies will improve.},

	abstract = {Gas infalling into the gravitational potential wells of massive galaxy clusters is expected to experience one or more shocks on its journey to becoming part of the intracluster medium ({ICM}). These shocks are important for setting the thermodynamic properties of the {ICM} and can therefore impact cluster observables such as X-ray emission and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ({SZ}) effect. We investigate the possibility of detecting signals from cluster shocks in the averaged thermal {SZ} profiles of galaxy clusters. Using zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of massive clusters from the Three Hundred Project, we show that if cluster {SZ} profiles are stacked as a function of \$R/R\_\{200m\}\$, shock-induced features appear in the averaged {SZ} profile. These features are not accounted for in standard fitting formulae for the {SZ} profiles of galaxy clusters. We show that the shock features should be detectable with samples of clusters from ongoing and future {SZ} surveys. We also demonstrate that the location of these features is correlated with the cluster accretion rate, as well as the location of the cluster splashback radius. Analyses of ongoing and future surveys, such as {SPT}-3g, {AdvACT}, Simons Observatory and {CMB}-S4, that include gas shocks will gain a new handle on the properties and dynamics of the outskirts of massive halos, both in gas and in mass.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new method to constrain the metallicities of high redshift damped Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ ({DLA}) absorbers using observed extinction curves. This is the first time such an approach is employed to constrain the metallicities of extragalactic absorbers. To demonstrate our method, we use the spectra of 13 quasars and one {GRB} with {DLA} absorbers detected along their sightlines. By using the Kramers-Kronig ({KK}) relation, which relates the wavelength-integrated extinction to the total volume occupied by dust per hydrogen nucleon, we set some robust lower limits on the metallicity of the {DLAs}. The resulting lower limits are all consistent with the {DLA} metallicities from the literature. The {GRB} extinction curve exhibits a very strong 2175 A extinction bump. We try to constrain the metallicity of the {GRB} {DLA} by modeling the {GRB} extinction curve using dust models with two (graphite and silicates) and three ({PAH}, hydrogenated amorphous carbon, and silicates) dust components. The two-component model resulted in a metallicity of \$Z{\textbackslash}sim\$\$-\$0.45 while the three-component model gives \$Z{\textbackslash}sim\$\$-\$0.50. On the other hand, the lower limit from the {KK} approach for this {DLA} is \$Z{\textbackslash}ge\$\$-\$0.60. Modeling a large sample of extinction curves with 2175 A extinction bump and measured {DLA} metallicities would allow a thorough comparison between the {KK} and the model-dependent approach. In cases where the precise measurement of the metallicity of a {DLA} is not possible (e.g. due to the saturation of important absorption lines), the approach presented in this paper can be used to constrain the metallicity.},

The model clouds start from both hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium and are in pressure balance with the {CGM}. Here, we present 14 models, divided into two mass categories and two metallicities each and different velocities. We allow for self-gravity and thermal conduction or not. All models experience mass diffusion, radiative cooling, and external heating leading to dissociation and ionization. Our main findings are: 1) self-gravity stabilizes clouds against Rayleigh-Taylor instability which are disrupted within 10 sound-crossing times without; 2) clouds can develop Jeans-instable regions internally even though they are initially below Jeans mass; 3) all clouds lose mass by ram pressure and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability; 4) thermal conduction substantially lowers mass-loss rates, by this, extending the clouds' lifetimes, particularly, more than doubling the lifetime of low-mass clouds; 5) thermal conduction leads to continuous, filamentary stripping, while the removed gas is heated up quickly and mixes efficiently with the ambient {CGM}; 6) without thermal conduction the removed gas consists of dense, cool, clumpy fragments; 7) thermal conduction might prevent {CHVCs} from forming stars; 8) clouds decelerated by means of drag from the ambient {CGM} form head-tail shapes and collapse after they reach velocities characteristic for intermediate-velocity clouds. Conclusively, only sophisticated modelling of {CHVCs} as non-homogeneous and non-isothermal clouds with thermal conduction and self-gravity explains observed morphologies and naturally leads to the suppression of star formation.},

	abstract = {Gaseous inflows are necessary suppliers of galaxies' star-forming fuel, but are difficult to characterize at the survey scale. We use integral-field spectroscopic measurements of gas-phase metallicity and single-dish radio measurements of total atomic gas mass to estimate the magnitude and frequency of gaseous inflows incident on star-forming galaxies. We reveal a mutual correlation between steep oxygen abundance profiles between \$0.25-1.5 R\_e\$, increased variability of metallicity between \$1.25-1.75 R\_e\$, and elevated {HI} content at fixed total galaxy stellar mass. Employing a simple but intuitive inflow model, we find that galaxies with total stellar mass less than \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10.1\} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$ have local oxygen abundance profiles consistent with reinvigoration by inflows. Approximately 10-25{\textbackslash}\% of low-mass galaxies possess signatures of recent accretion, with estimated typical enhancements of approximately 10-90{\textbackslash}\% in local gas mass surface density. Higher-mass galaxies have limited evidence for such inflows. The large diversity of {HI} mass implies that inflow-associated gas ought to reside far from the star-forming disk. We therefore propose that a combination of high {HI} mass, steep metallicity profile between \$0.25-1.5 R\_e\$, and wide metallicity distribution function between \$1.25 - 1.75 R\_e\$ be employed to target possible hosts of inflowing gas for high-resolution radio follow-up.},

	abstract = {Carbon monoxide ({CO}) is the best tracer of Galactic molecular hydrogen (H2). Its lowest rotational emission lines are in the radio regime and thanks to Galactic rotation emission at different distances is Doppler shifted. For a given gas flow model the observed spectra can thus be deprojected along the line of sight to infer the gas distribution. We use the {CO} line survey of Dame et al. (2001) to reconstruct the three-dimensional density of H2. We consider the deprojection as a Bayesian variational inference problem. The posterior distribution of the gas densities allows us to estimate both the mean and uncertainty of the reconstructed density. Unlike most of the previous attempts, we take into account the correlations of gas on a variety of scales which allows curing some of the well-known pathologies, like fingers-of-god effects. Both gas flow models that we adopt incorporate a Galactic bar which induces radial motions in the inner few kiloparsecs and thus offers spectral resolution towards the Galactic centre. We compare our gas maps with those of earlier studies and characterise their statistical properties, e.g. the radial profile of the average surface mass density.

We relate the observations to expectations from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Magneticum suite. We trace the irregular morphology of warm-hot gas of the main clusters from their centers out to well beyond their characteristic radii, \$r\_\{200\}\$. Between the two main cluster systems, we observe an emission bridge; thanks to {eROSITA}'s unique soft response and large field of view, we discover tantalizing hints for warm gas. Several matter clumps physically surrounding the system are detected. For the "Northern Clump," we provide evidence that it is falling towards A3391 from the hot gas morphology and radio lobe structure of its central {AGN}. Many of the extended sources in the field detected by {eROSITA} are known clusters or new clusters in the background, including a known {SZ} cluster at redshift z=1. We discover an emission filament north of the virial radius, \$r\_\{100\}\$, of A3391 connecting to the Northern Clump and extending south of A3395 towards another galaxy cluster. The total projected length of this continuous warm-hot emission filament is 15 Mpc, running almost 4 degrees across the entire {eROSITA} observation. The {DECam} galaxy density map shows galaxy overdensities in the same regions. The new datasets provide impressive confirmation of the theoretically expected structure formation processes on the individual system level, including the surrounding warm-hot intergalactic medium distribution compared to the Magneticum simulation. Our spatially resolved findings show that baryons indeed reside in large-scale warm-hot gas filaments with a clumpy structure.},

Typical star forming galaxies are found to lie in a 'star forming plane' largely independent of their stellar mass. Their star formation activity is tightly correlated with the molecular and total gas content, while variations of the molecular-gas-to-star conversion efficiency are shown to be significantly smaller than previously reported. These data-driven findings suggest that physical processes that modify the overall galactic gas content, such as gas accretion and outflows, regulate the star formation activity in typical nearby galaxies, while a change in efficiency triggered by, e.g., galaxy mergers or gas instabilities, may boost the activity of starbursts.},

Here we report soft-X-ray-emitting bubbles that extend approximately 14 kiloparsecs above and below the Galactic centre and include a structure in the southern sky analogous to the North Polar Spur. The sharp boundaries of these bubbles trace collisionless and non-radiative shocks, and corroborate the idea that the bubbles are not a remnant of a local supernova but part of a vast Galaxy-scale structure closely related to features seen in gamma-rays.

We confirm that the combined Schmidt law can be fitted with a single power law with slope \$n = 1.5{\textbackslash}pm0.05\$ (including fitting method uncertainties), somewhat steeper than the value \$n = 1.4{\textbackslash}pm0.15\$ found by K98. Fitting separate power laws to the non-starbursting and starburst galaxies, however, produces very different slopes (\$n = 1.34{\textbackslash}pm0.07\$ and \$0.98{\textbackslash}pm0.07\$, respectively), with a pronounced offset in the zeropoint (\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.6{\textbackslash},dex) of the starburst relation to higher {SFR} surface densities. This offset is seen even when a common conversion factor between {CO} intensity and molecular hydrogen surface density is applied, and is confirmed when disk surface densities of interstellar dust are used as proxies for gas measurements. Tests for possible systematic biases in the starburst data fail to uncover any spurious sources for such a large offset. We tentatively conclude that the global Schmidt law in galaxies, at least as it is conventionally measured, is bimodal or possibly multi-modal.

	abstract = {Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) is a ubiquitous numerical method for solving the fluid equations, and is prized for its conservation properties, natural adaptivity, and simplicity. We introduce the Sphenix {SPH} scheme, which was designed with three key goals in mind: to work well with sub-grid physics modules that inject energy, be highly computationally efficient (both in terms of compute and memory), and to be Lagrangian. Sphenix uses a Density-Energy equation of motion, along with variable artificial viscosity and conduction, including limiters designed to work with common sub-grid models of galaxy formation. In particular, we present and test a novel limiter that prevents conduction across shocks, preventing spurious radiative losses in feedback events. Sphenix is shown to solve many difficult test problems for traditional {SPH}, including fluid mixing and vorticity conservation, and it is shown to produce convergent behaviour in all tests where this is appropriate. Crucially, we use the same parameters within Sphenix for the various switches throughout, to demonstrate the performance of the scheme as it would be used in production simulations.},

The Lya nebulae revealed in deep {MUSE} observations exhibit a double-peak profile with a dominant red peak that indicates expansion/outflowing motions. One of the arcs stretches over 1' around the Einstein radius of the cluster, resolving the velocity field of the line-emitting gas on kpc scales around a group of three star-forming galaxies of 0.3-1.6L* at z=3.038. The second arc spans 15'' in size, roughly centered around a pair of low-mass Lya emitters of {\textasciitilde}0.03L* at z=3.754. All three galaxies in the z=3.038 group exhibit prominent damped Lya absorption ({DLA}) and several metal absorption lines, in addition to nebular emission lines such as {HeII}1640 and {CIII}]1906,1908. Extended Lya emission appears to emerge from star-forming regions to larger distances with suppressed surface brightness at the center of each galaxy, suggesting the presence of dusty outflowing cones of size 1-5 kpc across. There are significant spatial variations in the Lya line profile, consistent with the presence of a steep negative velocity gradient in a continuous flow of high column density gas from star-forming regions into a low-density halo environment. While the observed {UV} nebular line ratios show no evidence of {AGN} activity in the galaxies, the observed Lya signals can be explained by a combination of resonant scattering and recombination radiation due to photoionization by ionizing photons escaping from the nearby star-forming regions. These observations provide the most detailed insights yet into the kinematics of galactic superwinds associated with star-forming galaxies thought to be responsible for the chemical enrichment in the intergalactic medium.},

In this study, we use high resolution 3D simulations of multiphase galactic winds modeled with the hydrodynamics code Cholla to investigate the connection between numerical studies and observations. Using a simulated interaction between a hot \$T{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm K\$ supernova-driven wind and a cool \$T{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{4\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm K\$ cloud of interstellar material, we create mock observables, including the optical depth and covering fraction of six commonly observed ions (Si {II}, C {II}, Si {IV}, C {IV}, N V, and O {VI}) as a function of gas velocity. We compare our mock observables to surveys of galactic winds in the literature, finding good agreement with velocities and profiles of the low ions. We then compute "empirical" values for the optical depth and covering fraction following observational techniques, and compare them to the values calculated directly from the simulation data. We find that the empirically computed values tend to underestimate the "true" value of \${\textbackslash}tau\$ for ions with high optical depth, and overestimate the "true" value of \${\textbackslash}tau\$ for ions with low optical depth, relative to the simulated data.},

We derive the size (3.6{\textasciitilde}pc by 0.13{\textasciitilde}pc), temperature (10 to 15{\textasciitilde}K), and mass (1048{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}textit\{M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$\}) of {DR}21SF from Shanghai 65 m {TianMa} Radio Telescope ({TMRT}) observations of {NH}\$\_3\$ (1, 1) and (2, 2) inversion lines in conjunction with the column density map from our previous work. Star-forming sites are identified along the filament where gas temperature excesses. We find clear gradients in radial velocity and intrinsic line-width along the spine of the filament.

We detect one galaxy at 4\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance and place upper limits on the molecular gas reservoirs of the other 5, finding molecular gas mass fractions M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{H\_\{2\}\}\}\$/M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{*\}\}\$=f\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{H\_\{2\}\}\}{\textless}2-6\$\% (3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ upper limits).

The implied rapid depletion time of molecular gas (t\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{dep\}\}{\textless}0.6\$ Gyr) disagrees with extrapolations of empirical scaling relations to low {sSFR}. We find that our low gas fractions are instead in agreement with predictions from both the recent {SIMBA} cosmological simulation, and from analytical "bathtub" models for gas accretion onto galaxies in massive dark matter halos (log\$\_\{10\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{halo\}\}/{\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textbackslash}sim14\$ at \$z=0\$).

Our data is consistent with a simple picture where galaxies truncate accretion and then consume the existing gas at or faster than typical main sequence rates. Alternatively, we cannot rule out that these galaxies reside in lower mass halos, and low gas fractions may instead reflect either stronger feedback, or more efficient gas consumption.},

	abstract = {Observations of the \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray emission around star clusters, isolated supernova remnants, and pulsar wind nebulae indicate that cosmic ray ({CR}) diffusion coefficient near the acceleration sites can be suppressed by a large factor compared to the Galaxy average. We explore the effects of such local suppression of {CR} diffusion on galaxy evolution using simulations of isolated disk galaxies with regular and high gas fractions. Our results show that while {CR} propagation with constant diffusivity can make gaseous disks more stable by increasing the midplane pressure, large-scale {CR} pressure gradients cannot prevent local fragmentation when the disk is unstable. In contrast, when {CR} diffusivity is suppressed in star-forming regions, accumulation of {CRs} in these regions results in strong local pressure gradients that prevent formation of massive gaseous clumps. As a result, the distribution of dense gas and star formation changes qualitatively: a globally unstable gaseous disk does not violently fragment into massive star-forming clumps but maintains a regular grand-design spiral structure. This effect regulates star formation and disk structure and is qualitatively different from and complementary to the global role of {CRs} in vertical hydrostatic support of the gaseous disk and in driving galactic winds.},

	abstract = {The characterization of the large amount of gas residing in the galaxy halos, the so called circumgalactic medium ({CGM}), is crucial to understand galaxy evolution across cosmic time. We focus here on the the cool (\$T{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}4\$ K) phase of this medium around star-forming galaxies in the local universe, whose properties and dynamics are poorly understood. We developed semi-analytical parametric models to describe the cool {CGM} as an outflow of gas clouds from the central galaxy, as a result of supernova explosions in the disc (galactic wind). The cloud motion is driven by the galaxy gravitational pull and by the interactions with the hot (\$T{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}6\$ K) coronal gas. Through a bayesian analysis, we compare the predictions of our models with the data of the {COS}-Halos and {COS}-{GASS} surveys, which provide accurate kinematic information of the cool {CGM} around more than 40 low-redshift star-forming galaxies, probing distances up to the galaxy virial radii. Our findings clearly show that a supernova-driven outflow model is not suitable to describe the dynamics of the cool circumgalactic gas. Indeed, to reproduce the data, we need extreme scenarios, with initial outflow velocities and mass loading factors that would lead to unphysically high energy coupling from the supernovae to the gas and with supernova efficiencies largely exceeding unity. This strongly suggests that, since the outflows cannot reproduce most of the cool gas absorbers, the latter are likely the result of cosmological inflow in the outer galaxy halos, in analogy to what we have previously found for early-type galaxies.},

We carry out cloud-by-cloud, multiphase modeling making use of {CLOUDY} and Bayesian methods to extract physical properties from an ensemble of absorption profiles. Here, as a demonstration of method, we focus on four weak, low ionization absorbers at low redshift, because they are multi-phase but relatively simple to constrain. We place errors on the inferred metallicities and ionization parameters for individual clouds, and show that the values differ from component to component across the absorption profile. Our method requires user input on the number of phases and relies on an optimized transition for each phase, one observed with high resolution and signal-to-noise. The measured Doppler parameter of the optimized transition provides a constraint on the Doppler parameter of {HI}, thus providing leverage in metallicity measurements even when hydrogen lines are saturated. We present several tests of our methodology, demonstrating that we can recover the input parameters from simulated profiles. We also consider how our model results are affected by which radiative transitions are covered by observations (for example how many {HI} transitions) and by uncertainties in the b parameters of optimized transitions. We discuss the successes and limitations of the method, and consider its potential for large statistical studies. This improved methodology will help to establish direct connections between the diverse properties derived from characterizing the absorbers and the multiple physical processes at play in the circumgalactic medium.},

It is therefore the ideal system for investigating outflows and feedback phenomena in details. We investigate the feedback effects on the Arp220 {ISM}, deriving a detailed picture of the atomic gas in terms of physical and kinematic properties, with a spatial resolution never obtained before (0.56", i.e. {\textasciitilde} 210 pc). We use optical {IFS} observations from {VLT}/{MUSE}-{AO} to obtain spatially resolved stellar and gas kinematics, for both ionised ([N {II}]6583) and neutral (Na {ID}5891,96) components; we also derive dust attenuation, electron density, ionisation conditions and hydrogen column density maps to characterise the {ISM} properties. Arp220 kinematics reveal the presence of a disturbed, kpc-scale disk in the innermost nuclear regions, and highly perturbed, multi-phase (neutral and ionised) gas along the minor-axis of the disk, which we interpret as a galactic-scale outflow emerging from the Arp220 eastern nucleus. This outflow involves velocities up to {\textasciitilde} 1000 km/s at galactocentric distances of {\textasciitilde} 5 kpc, and has a mass rate of {\textasciitilde} 50 Msun/yr, and kinetic and momentum power of {\textasciitilde} 1e43 erg/s and {\textasciitilde} 1e35 dyne, respectively. The inferred energetics do not allow us to distinguish the origin of the outflows, i.e. whether they are {AGN}-driven or starburst-driven. We also present evidence for enhanced star formation at the edges of - and within - the outflow, with a star formation rate {SFR} {\textasciitilde} 5 Msun/yr (i.e. {\textasciitilde} 2\% of the total {SFR}). Our findings suggest the presence of powerful winds in Arp220: they might be capable of removing or heating large amounts of gas from the host ("negative feedback"), but could be also responsible for triggering star formation ("positive feedback").},

	abstract = {Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) is a Lagrangian method for solving the fluid equations that is commonplace in astrophysics, prized for its natural adaptivity and stability. The choice of variable to smooth in {SPH} has been the topic of contention, with smoothed pressure (P-{SPH}) being introduced to reduce errors at contact discontinuities relative to smoothed density schemes. Smoothed pressure schemes produce excellent results in isolated hydrodynamics tests; in more complex situations however, especially when coupling to the `sub-grid' physics and multiple time-stepping used in many state-of-the-art astrophysics simulations, these schemes produce large force errors that can easily evade detection as they do not manifest as energy non-conservation. Here two scenarios are evaluated: the injection of energy into the fluid (common for stellar feedback) and radiative cooling. In the former scenario, force and energy conservation errors manifest (of the same order as the injected energy), and in the latter large force errors that change rapidly over a few timesteps lead to instability in the fluid (of the same order as the energy lost to cooling). Potential ways to remedy these issues are explored with solutions generally leading to large increases in computational cost. Schemes using a Density-based formulation do not create these instabilities and as such it is recommended that they are preferred over Pressure-based solutions when combined with an energy diffusion term to reduce errors at contact discontinuities.},

This implies V\_esc{\textasciicircum}{MW}(50 kpc){\textasciitilde}365 km/s, a strong constraint on Galactic potential models. {LMC} analogues contribute only 2+-1 satellites with M*{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}5 Msun, and have thus only a mild impact on the luminous satellite population of their hosts. {LMC} satellites as luminous as the {SMC} seem rare, and none are found in our simulations. At first pericentre, {LMC}-associated satellites are close to the {LMC} in position and velocity, and are distributed along the {LMC}'s orbital plane. Their orbital angular momenta are nearly parallel to the {LMC}'s, but, interestingly, they may appear to "counter-rotate" the {MW} in some cases. These criteria refine earlier estimates of the {LMC} association of {MW} satellites: of all {MW} satellites with known distances and full velocity data, only the {SMC}, Hydrus1, Car3, Hor1, Tuc4, Ret2 and Phx2 are clearly compatible with all criteria. Carina, Grus2, Hor2 and Fornax are also possible associates, although their large {LMC} relative velocity weakens their case.},

We study the volume filling fraction of these strong field regions and their occurrence in random lines of sight.

As photon-axion coupling grows with energy, stronger constraints could potentially be obtained using data on the propagation of gamma-ray photons through the {IGM}.

Singly ionized C, Si, Fe, Mg, and Al measurements are consistent with a warm neutral medium that is metal-poor but not chemically pristine. Firm non-detections of C {IV} and Si {IV} imply that any warm ionized phase of the {IGM} or {CGM} has not yet been enriched past the ultra-metal-poor regime ({\textless}0.001Z\_\{solar\}), unlike lower redshift {DLAs} where these lines are nearly ubiquitous. Relative abundances of the heavy elements 794 Myr after the Big Bang resemble those of metal-poor damped Lyman Alpha systems at intermediate redshift and Milky Way halo stars, and show no evidence of enhanced [alpha/Fe], [C/Fe] or other signatures of yields dominated by massive stars. A detection of the {CII}* fine structure line reveals local sources of excitation from heating, beyond the level of photo-excitation supplied by the {CMB}. We estimate the total and [{CII}] cooling rates, balancing against {ISM} heating sources to develop an heuristic two-phase model of the neutral medium. The implied heating requires a surface density of star formation slightly exceeding that of the Milky Way but not at the level of a strong starburst. For a typical (assumed) {NHI}=10{\textasciicircum}\{20.6\}, an abundance of [Fe/H]=-2.2 matches the columns of species in the neutral phase. To remain undetected in C {IV}, a warm ionized phase would either need much lower [C/H]{\textless}-4.2 over an absorption path of 1 kpc, or else a very small absorption path (a few pc). While still speculative, these results suggest a significant reduction in heavy element enrichment outside of neutral star forming regions of the {ISM}, as would be expected in early stages of galactic chemical evolution.},

	abstract = {Radioactive 26Al is an excellent tracer for metal ejection in the Milky Way, and can provide a direct constraint on the modelling of supernova feedback in galaxy evolution. Gamma-ray observations of the 26Al decay line have found high velocities and hence require a significant fraction of the Galactic 26Al in the hot component. At the same time, meteoritic data combined with simulation results suggest that a significant amount of 26Al makes its way into stars before decay. We investigated the distribution into hot and cold channels with a simulation of a Milky-Way-like galaxy with massive-star feedback in superbubbles and with ejecta traced by 26Al. About 30-40 per cent of the ejecta remain hot, with typical cooling times of the order Gyr. 26Al traces the footpoints of a chimney-fed outflow that mixes metals turbulently into the halo of the model galaxy on a scale of at least 50 kpc. The rest diffuses into cold gas with temperatures less than about 10,000 K, and may therefore be quickly available for star formation. We discuss the robustness of the result by comparison to a simulation with a different global flow pattern. The branching ratio into hot and cold components is comparable to that of longer term average results from chemical evolution modelling of galaxies, clusters and the intracluster medium.},

Despite theoretical efforts, there is not a unique explanation for these features and the observational results are not conclusive. In an attempt to address this problem, we have selected a sample of 34 highly inclined spiral galaxies present in both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS}) and the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S 4G). We have measured the surface-brightness profiles in the five Sloan optical bands and in the 3.6-μm Spitzer band. We have also calculated the colour and stellar surface mass density profiles using the available photometric information, finding two differentiated features: an innermost break radius at distances of ∼8 ± 1kpc [0.77 ± 0.06R 25] and a second characteristic radius, or truncation radius, close to the outermost optical extent (∼14 ± 2kpc [1.09 ± 0.05R 25]) of the galaxy. We propose in this work that breaks might be phenomena related to a threshold in the star formation, while truncations are more likely a real drop in the stellar mass density of the disc associated with the maximum angular momentum of the stars. © 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2012 {RAS}.},

I show that over eight orders of magnitude in stellar mass galaxies of all morphological types follow an approximately linear relation between half-mass radius of their stellar distribution, r 1/2, and virial radius, r 1/2 ≈ 0.015 R 200, with scatter of ≈0.2 dex. Such scaling is in remarkable agreement with the expectation of models that assume that galaxy sizes are controlled by halo angular momentum, r 1/2{λR} 200, where λ is the spin of galaxy parent halo. The scatter about the relation is comparable with the scatter expected from the distribution of λ. Moreover, I show that when the stellar and gas surface density profiles of galaxies of different morphological types are rescaled by the radius rn= 0.015 R 200, the rescaled profiles follow approximately universal exponential (for late types) and de Vaucouleurs (for early types) form with scatter of only ≈30\%-50\% at R ≈ 1-3rn. Remarkably, both late- and early-type galaxies have similar mean stellar surface density profiles at R ≳ 1r n. The main difference between their stellar distributions is thus at R {\textless} rn. The results of this study imply that galaxy sizes and radial distribution of baryons are shaped primarily by properties of their parent halos and that the sizes of both late-type disks and early-type spheroids are controlled by halo angular momentum. © 2013.

	abstract = {Context. Edge-on spiral galaxies often have stellar disks with relatively sharp truncations and there is extensive observational material of warped {HI}-layers in the outer parts. Warps appear to start preferentially near the optical boundaries of the disks, but the possible relation between truncations and warps has not been studied in detail. Aims. The aim is to make a comparative study of warps and truncations in edge-on galaxies. Samples with detailed surface photometry or {HI}-mapping have little overlap. The García-Ruiz et al. (2002, A\&A, 394, 769) sample with extensive Westerbork {HI}-mapping is a candidate to be complemented with luminosity distributions from other sources. Methods. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (and in a few cases the {STScI} Digital Sky Survey) has been used to provide these data. The method to identify truncations in these digital datasets has been tested using the sample of edge-on galaxies of van der Kruit \& Searle (1981a, A\&A, 95, 105; 1981b, A\&A, 95, 116; 1982a, A\&A, 110, 61; 1982b, A\&A, 110, 79). Results, (i) The majority (17 out of 23) of the galaxies show evidence for truncations, consistent with previous findings in other samples; (ii) when an {HI}-warp is present it starts at 1.1 truncation radii (statistically allowing all possible geometries); (iii) this supplements the rules for warps formulated by Briggs (1990, {ApJ}, 352, 15), if the Holmberg radius is replaced for edge-on systems with the truncation radius; (iv) the truncation radius and the onset of the warps coincide radially sometimes with features in the rotation curve and often with steep declines in the {HI} surface density. The latter is also true for less inclined systems; (v) inner disks are very flat and the onset of the warp just beyond the truncation radius is abrupt and discontinuous; (vi) in an appendix the definition and derivation of the Holmberg radius is discussed. Contrary to what is often assumed in the literature Holmberg radii are not corrected for inclination. Conclusions. These findings suggest that the inner flat disk and the outer warped disk are distinct components with quite different formation histories, probably involving quite different epochs. The inner disk forms initially (either in a monolithic process in a short period or hierarchically on a somewhat more protracted timescale) and the warped outer disk forms as a result of much later infall of gas with a higher angular momentum in a different orientation. The results are also consistent in this picture with an origin of the disk truncations that is related to the maximum specific angular momentum available during its formation. © {ESO} 2007.},

The range and maximum of the intrinsic flattening of the disc light seem to increase with both maximum rotational velocity and total H I mass. We use the disc flattening to estimate the disc contribution to the maximum rotational velocity, resulting in an average of 57 ± 22 per cent. The disc light distributions are further investigated for the presence of radial truncations. We find that the radial light distributions of at least 20 spirals are truncated, corresponding to 60 per cent of the sample. For small scalelength spirals, which are the most numerous in the local Universe, the results suggest that the average ratio of disc truncation radius to disc scalelength is at least four.},

	abstract = {Energy injection by supernovae may drive hot supersonic galactic winds in rapidly star-forming galaxies, driving metal-enriched gas into the circumgalactic medium and potentially accelerating cool gas. If sufficiently mass-loaded, such flows become radiative within the wind-driving region, reducing the overall mass outflow rate from the host galaxy. We show that this sets a maximum on the total outflow momentum for hot energy-driven winds. For a spherical wind of Solar metallicity driven by continuous star formation, \${\textbackslash}dot p\_{\textbackslash}rm\{max\} {\textbackslash}simeq 1.9{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}4{\textbackslash} M\_{\textbackslash}odot/{\textbackslash}rm\{yr{\textbackslash} km/s\}{\textbackslash} ({\textbackslash}alpha/0.9){\textasciicircum}\{0.86\}(R\_{\textbackslash}star/300{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm\{pc\}){\textasciicircum}\{0.14\}({\textbackslash}dot M\_{\textbackslash}star/20{\textbackslash} M\_{\textbackslash}odot/{\textbackslash}rm\{yr\}){\textasciicircum}\{0.86\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ is the fraction of supernova energy that thermalizes the wind, and \${\textbackslash}dot M\_{\textbackslash}star\$ and \$R\_{\textbackslash}star\$ are the star formation rate and radius of the wind-driving region. This maximum momentum for hot winds can also apply to cool, ionized outflows that are typically observed in starburst galaxies, if the hot wind undergoes bulk radiative cooling or if the hot wind transfers mass and momentum to cool clouds within the flow. We show that requiring the hot wind to undergo single-phase cooling on large scales sets a minimum on the total outflow momentum rate. These maximum and minimum outflow momenta have similar values, setting a characteristic momentum rate of hot galactic winds that can become radiative on large scales. We find that most observations of photoionized outflow wind momentum fall below the theoretical maximum and thus may be signatures of cooling hot flows. On the other hand, many systems fall below the minimum momentum required for bulk cooling, indicating that perhaps the cool material observed has instead been entrained in or mixed with the hot flow.},

By comparing to data on galaxy properties in different environments from the {SDSS} and {HSC} surveys, we demonstrate that our modified model improves the agreement with the quenched fractions and star formation rates of galaxies as a function of environment, stellar mass, and redshift. Overall, in the vicinity of haloes with total mass \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at \$z=0\$, our new model produces higher quenched fractions and stronger environmental dependencies, better recovering observed trends with halocentric distance up to several virial radii. By analysing the actual amount of gas stripped from galaxies in our model, we show that those in the vicinity of massive haloes lose a large fraction of their hot halo gas before they become satellites. We demonstrate that this affects galaxy quenching both within and beyond the halo boundary. This is likely to influence the correlations between galaxies up to tens of megaparsecs.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05335},
	abstract = {Quasar absorption systems encode a wealth of information about the abundances, ionization structure, and physical conditions in intergalactic and circumgalactic media. Simple (often single-phase) photoionization models are frequently used to decode such data. Using five discrete absorbers from the {COS} Absorption Survey of Baryon Harbors ({CASBaH}) that exhibit a wide range of detected ions (e.g., Mg {II}, S {II}--S {VI}, O {II}--O {VI}, Ne {VIII}), we show several examples where single-phase ionization models cannot reproduce the full set of measured column densities. To explore models that can self-consistently explain the measurements and kinematic alignment of disparate ions, we develop a Bayesian multiphase ionization modeling framework that characterizes discrete phases by their unique physical conditions and also investigates variations in the shape of the {UV} flux field, metallicity, and relative abundances. Our models require at least two (but favor three) distinct ionization phases ranging from \$T {\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{4\}\$ K photoionized gas to warm-hot phases at \$T {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{5.8\}\$ K. For some ions, an apparently single absorption "component" includes contributions from more than one phase, and up to 30\% of the H I is not from the lowest ionization phase. If we assume that all of the phases are photoionized, we cannot find solutions in thermal pressure equilibrium. By introducing hotter, collisionally ionized phases, however, we can achieve balanced pressures. The best models indicate moderate metallicities, often with sub-solar N/\${\textbackslash}alpha\$, and, in two cases, ionizing flux fields that are softer and brighter than the fiducial Haardt \& Madau {UV} background model.},

	abstract = {Galactic winds are crucial to the cosmic cycle of matter, transporting material out of the dense regions of galaxies. Observations show the coexistence of different temperature phases in such winds, which is not easy to explain. We present a set of 3D shock-multicloud simulations that account for radiative heating and cooling at temperatures between \$10{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm K\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}7{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm K\$. The interplay between shock heating, dynamical instabilities, turbulence, and radiative heating and cooling creates a complex multi-phase flow with a rain-like morphology. Cloud gas fragments and is continuously eroded, becoming efficiently mixed and mass loaded. The resulting warm mixed gas then cools down and precipitates into new dense cloudlets, which repeat the process. Thus, radiative cooling is able to sustain fast-moving dense gas by aiding condensation of gas from warm clouds and the hot wind. In the ensuing outflow, hot gas with temperatures \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}6{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm K\$ outruns the warm and cold phases, which reach thermal equilibrium near \${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}4{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm K\$ and \${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm K\$, respectively. Although the volume filling factor of hot gas is higher in the outflow, most of the mass is concentrated in dense gas cloudlets and filaments with these temperatures. More porous multicloud layers result in more vertically extended outflows, and dense gas is more efficiently produced in more compact layers. The cold phase is not accelerated by ram-pressure, but, instead, precipitates from warm and mixed gas out of thermal equilibrium. This cycle can explain the presence of high-velocity H{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}sc i\} gas with \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm H{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}scriptstyle I\}\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{19-21\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}Delta v\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm {FWHM}\}\}{\textbackslash}lesssim37{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm km{\textbackslash},s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in the Galactic centre outflow.},

	abstract = {We study the impact of cosmic rays ({CRs}) on the structure of virial shocks, using a large suite of high-resolution cosmological {FIRE}-2 simulations accounting for {CR} injection by supernovae. In massive (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$), low-redshift (\$z{\textbackslash}lesssim 1-2\$) halos, which are expected to form "hot halos" with slowly-cooling gas in quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium (with a stable virial shock), our simulations without {CRs} do exhibit clear virial shocks. The cooler phase condensing out from inflows becomes pressure-confined to over-dense clumps, embedded in low-density, volume-filling hot gas whose cooling time is much longer than inflow time. The gas thus transitions sharply from cool free-falling inflow, to hot and thermal-pressure supported at approximately the virial radius (\${\textbackslash}approx R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}\$), and the shock is quasi-spherical. With {CRs}, we previously argued that halos in this particular mass and redshift range build up {CR}-pressure-dominated gaseous halos. Here, we show that when {CR} pressure dominates over thermal pressure, there is no significant virial shock. Instead, inflowing gas is gradually decelerated by the {CR} pressure gradient and the gas is relatively subsonic out to and even beyond \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\$. Rapid cooling also maintains sub-virial temperatures in the inflowing gas within \${\textbackslash}sim R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\$.},

New observations of molecular hydrogen reveal its evolution mirrors that of the global star formation rate density. The constant cosmic molecular gas depletion timescale points to a universal relationship between gas reservoirs and star formation.

At lower redshifts, the contributors to the total amount of metals are more diverse; at z {\textless} 1, most of the observed metals are bound in stars. Overall there is little evidence for a "missing metals problem" in modern censuses. We characterize the dust content of neutral gas over cosmic time, finding the dust-to-gas and dust-to-metals ratios fall with decreasing metallicity. We calculate the cosmological dust mass density in the neutral gas up to z {\textasciitilde} 5. There is good agreement between multiple tracers of the dust content of the Universe.},

	title = {The Elephant in the Bathtub: when the physics of star formation regulate the baryon cycle of galaxies},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01235},
	abstract = {In simple models of galaxy formation and evolution, star formation is solely regulated by the amount of gas present in the galaxy. However, it has recently been shown that star formation can be suppressed by galactic dynamics in galaxies that contain a dominant spheroidal component and a low gas fraction. This 'dynamical suppression' is hypothesised to also contribute to quenching gas-rich galaxies at high redshift, but its impact on the galaxy population at large remains unclear. In this paper, we assess the importance of dynamical suppression in the context of gas regulator models of galaxy evolution through hydrodynamic simulations of isolated galaxies, with gas-to-stellar mass ratios of 0.01-0.20 and a range of galactic gravitational potentials from disc-dominated to spheroidal. Star formation is modelled using a dynamics-dependent efficiency per free-fall time, which depends on the virial parameter of the gas. We find that dynamical suppression becomes more effective at lower gas fractions and quantify its impact on the star formation rate as a function of gas fraction and stellar spheroid mass surface density. We combine the results of our simulations with observed scaling relations that describe the change of galaxy properties across cosmic time, and determine the galaxy mass and redshift range where dynamical suppression may affect the baryon cycle. We predict that the physics of star formation can limit and regulate the baryon cycle at low redshifts (\$z {\textbackslash}lesssim 1.4\$) and high galaxy masses (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$), where dynamical suppression can drive galaxies off the star formation main sequence.},

Diffuse X-ray emission from the hot gaseous halo around the galaxy is robustly detected out to a radius of 160 kpc, corresponding roughly to 35 per cent of the virial radius (\${\textbackslash}approx 450\$ kpc). We fit the X-ray emission with the standard isothermal \${\textbackslash}beta\$ model, and it is found that the enclosed gas mass within 160 kpc is \$1.15\_\{-0.24\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.22\} {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$.

When the stellar mass is considered and accounting for the statistical and systematic uncertainties, the baryon mass fraction within the virial radius is \$0.121\_\{-0.043\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.043\}\$, in agreement with the universal baryon fraction. The baryon mass fraction is consistent with all baryons falling within \$r\_\{200\}\$, or with only half of the baryons falling within \$r\_\{200\}\$. Similar to the massive spiral galaxies {NGC} 1961 and {NGC} 6753, we find a low value for the metal abundance of \${\textbackslash}approx 0.1 \{{\textbackslash}rm\{Z\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, which appears uniform with radius. We also detect diffuse X-ray emission associated with the northern and southern lobes, possibly attributed to inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons. The estimated energy densities of the electrons and magnetic field in these radio lobes suggest that they are electron-dominated by a factor of 10\$-\$200, depending on the choice of the lower cut-off energy of the electron spectrum.},

	abstract = {It is well-known that some workers in scientific research laboratories are enormously more creative than others. If the number of scientific publications is used as a measure of productivity, it is found that some individuals create new science at a rate at least fifty times greater than others. Thus differences in rates of scientific production are much bigger than differences in the rates of performing simpler acts, such as the rate of running the mile, or the number of words a man can speak per minute. On the basis of statistical studies of rates of publication, it is found that it is more appropriate to consider not simply the rate of publication but its logarithm. The logarithm appears to have a normal distribution over the population of typical research laboratories. The existence of a “log-normal distribution” suggests that the logarithm of the rate of production is a manifestation of some fairly fundamental mental attribute. The great variation in rate of production from one individual to another can be explained on the basis of simplified models of the mental processes concerned. The common feature in the models is that a large number of factors are involved so that small changes in each, all in the same direction, may result in a very large change in output. For example, the number of ideas a scientist can bring into awareness at one time may control his ability to make an invention and his rate of invention may increase very rapidly with this number.},

We examine such innovations more closely and, distinguishing between the components of a product and the ways they are integrated into the system that is the product "architecture," define them as innovations that change the architecture of a product without changing its components. We show that architectural innovations destroy the usefulness of the architectural knowledge of established firms, and that since architectural knowledge tends to become embedded in the structure and information-processing procedures of established organizations, this destruction is difficult for firms to recognize and hard to correct. Architectural innovation therefore presents established organizations with subtle challenges that may have significant competitive implications. We illustrate the concept's explanatory force through an empirical study of the semiconductor photolithographic alignment equipment industry, which has experienced a number of architectural innovations.},

	abstract = {On 18 July 1733, half a dozen years after Isaac Newton's death, Dr William Derham (a close friend during his last years) observed that "Sir Is[aac] ... abhorred all Contests.... And for this reason, mainly to avoid being baited by little Smatterers in Mathematicks, he told me, he designedly made his Principia abstruse; but yet so as to be understood by able Mathematicians, who he imagined, by comprehending his Demonstrations, would concurr with him in his Theory". Forty years before, as Newton passed unseeingly by in the street at Cambridge, a nameless undergraduate had remarked sotto voce: "There goes the man that writt a book that neither he nor anybody else understands". Evidently, if it had been Newton's intention in the 1680s to make his mathematical world-view impossibly difficult for all but a tightly restricted elite to comprehend, in this one case at least he succeeded only too well. But was it? When we go behind such hearsay and anecdote, we will find that there is no trustworthy documentary evidence that Newton did deliberately contrive to render his Mathematical principles ofnatural philosophy more esoteric and impenetrable than he need have done. No one would deny that this ikon of scientific history is far from easy to read. Quite bluntly, the logical structure of Newton's book is slipshod, its level of verbal fluency none too high, its arguments unnecessarily diffuse and repetitive, and its very content on occasion markedly irrelevant to its professed theme: the theory of bodies in motion. But these faults are far from intentional and can largely be excused by the very rapidity with which the Principia was written-in little more than two years from the autumn of 1684 - and its author's distinct lack of talent for writing in a popular way. Of such weaknesses no one was more conscious than Newton himself: indeed, we now know that in the early 1690s, soon after his book appeared, he reluctantly contemplated a grand revision of his work which he never found time and energy to implement! In default we must suffer the crudities of the text as we have it in order to master the Principia's complex mathematical and scientific content. To attain this understanding there is no royal road which can bypass its conceptual difficulties, no novice's path which will soften its mathematical rigours. Newton himself tried to lighten the heavy load of preparatory learning for such acquaintances as Trinity College's guiding genius, Richard Bentley, who sought to achieve a limited understanding of merely the basic propositions ofthe Principia, but he succeeded none too well in his altruistic purpose. Having given Bentley the eminently sensible advice that "At the first perusal of my Book it's enough if you understand the Propositions with some of the Demonstrations which are easier than the rest ... [then] pass on to the 3rd Book \& when you see the design of that you may turn back to such Propositions as you shall have a desire to know", Newton was then ineluctably led to compile for him in 1691 a formidable mathematical reading list which of necessity referred much more to recent works in geometrical and infinitesimal analysis than to traditional algebra and classical geometry. The Principia was-and is-accessible in its detail only to the mathematically sophisticated. In Newton's own lifetime only a handful of his contemporaries working without distraction at the frontiers of current research-maybe only the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, the German uomo universale Leibniz, the able Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli, the French priest Pierre Varignon, the Huguenot expatriate Abraham De Moivre and Newton's most able editor Roger Cotes-had, each in his own way, achieved a working knowledge of the Principia's technical content.},

We find scaling rules for the commonly occurring case of directed scale-free networks, in which the outgoing degree distribution scales as [Formula presented] Considering the power exponent of the degree distribution, [Formula presented] as a control parameter, we show that random networks exhibit transitions between three regimes.

	abstract = {Background: The rise of electronic publishing [1], preprint archives, blogs, and wikis is raising concerns among publishers, editors, and scientists about the present day relevance of academic journals and traditional peer review [2]. These concerns are especially fuelled by the ability of search engines to automatically identify and sort information [1]. It appears that academic journals can only remain relevant if acceptance of research for publication within a journal allows readers to infer immediate, reliable information an the value of that research. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of journals, through the work of editors and reviewers, at evaluating unpublished research. We find that the distribution of the number of citations to a paper published in a given journal in a specific year converges to a steady state after a journal-specific transient time, and demonstrate that in the steady state the logarithm of the number of citations has a journal-specific typical value. We then develop a model for the asymptotic number of citations accrued by papers published in a journal that closely matches the data. Conclusions/Significance: Our model enables us to quantify both the typical impact and the range of impacts of papers published in a journal. Finally, we propose a journal-ranking scheme that maximizes the efficiency of locating high impact research. Copyright: © 2008 Stringer et al.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates a possibly fundamental aspect of technological progress. If knowledge accumulates as technology advances, then successive generations of innovators may face an increasing educational burden. Innovators can compensate through lengthening educational phases and narrowing expertise, but these responses come at the cost of reducing individual innovative capacities, with implications for the organization of innovative activity - a greater reliance on teamwork - and negative implications for growth. Building on this "burden of knowledge" mechanism, this paper first presents six facts about innovator behaviour. I show that age at first invention, specialization, and teamwork increase over time in a large micro-data set of inventors. Furthermore, in cross-section, specialization and teamwork appear greater in deeper areas of knowledge, while, surprisingly, age at first invention shows little variation across fields. A model then demonstrates how these facts can emerge in tandem. The theory further develops explicit implications for economic growth, providing an explanation for why productivity growth rates did not accelerate through the 20th century despite an enormous expansion in collective research effort. Upward trends in academic collaboration and lengthening doctorates, which have been noted in other research, can also be explained in this framework. The knowledge burden mechanism suggests that the nature of innovation is changing, with negative implications for long-run economic growth. © 2009 The Review of Economic Studies Limited.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02976},
	abstract = {Chemical bimodality of the Milky Way ({MW}) disc stars constitutes one of the most remarkable properties of {MW}. The cold accretion theory for the cosmological gas accretion provides one viable explanation to this phenomenon. In this scenario, the rapid cold-mode accretion in the early epoch creates the first generation stars relatively rich in \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-elements(O,Mg,Si,S,Ca,etc) and later cooling flow produces iron-rich second generation stars, creating the bimodality in the [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] ratio. We employ a cosmologically motivated chemical evolution model for disc galaxies to elucidate the role played by type Ia supernovae ({SNIa}), which serve as the major source of iron, in the creation of the bimodality. To this end, we divide {SNIa} into two groups, those formed from the 1st generation stars (the first {SNIa}) and those formed from the 2nd generation stars (the second {SNIa}). The model with the first {SNIa} suppressed during the \{{\textbackslash}it second\} star formation stage produces stars having high [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] in the early phase of this stage, whereas the model which prohibits the second {SNIa} produces high [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] stars in the late phase. Both models fail to create a well-defined bimodality. We thus conclude that the cooperation of the first and the second {SNIa} plays a crucial role in creating the bimodality by maintaining rich iron content in the interstellar gas throughout the second star formation stage.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03327},
	abstract = {Galaxy mergers are traditionally one of the favoured mechanisms for quenching star formation. To test this paradigm in the context of modern cosmological simulations, we use the {IllustrisTNG} simulation to investigate the impact of individual merger events on quenching (i.e. star formation rate at least 3sig below the star-forming main sequence) within 500Myr after the coalescence phase.The rate of quenching amongst recently merged galaxies is compared with a control sample that is matched in redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate ({SFR}), black hole mass and environment.We find quenching to be uncommon among the descendants of post-merger galaxies, with only 5\% of galaxies quenching within 500 Myr after the merger.Despite this low absolute rate, we find that quenching occurs in post-mergers at twice the rate of the control galaxies.The fraction of quenched post-merger descendants 1.5 Gyr after the merger becomes statistically indistinguishable from that of non-post-mergers, suggesting that mergers could speed up the quenching process in those post-mergers whose progenitors had physical conditions able to sustain effective active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) kinetic feedback, thus capable of removing gas from galaxies.Our results indicate that although quenching does not commonly occur promptly after coalescence, mergers nonetheless do promote the cessation of star formation in some post-mergers. We find that, in {IllustrisTNG}, it is the implementation of the {AGN} kinetic feedback that is responsible for quenching post-mergers, as well as non-post-merger controls.As a result of the released kinetic energy, galaxies experience gas loss and eventually, they will quench.Galaxies with an initially low gas fraction show a preferable pre-disposition towards quenching.The primary distinguishing factor between quenched and star-forming galaxies is gas fraction, with a sharp boundary at fgas=0.1 in {TNG}.},

We select haloes from the simulations that are actively cooling and study the temperature, distribution and metallicity of their hot, cold and transitioning 'cooling' gas, placing these in the context of semi-analytic models. Our selection criteria lead us to focus on Milky Way-like haloes. We find that the hot-gas density profiles of the haloes form a progressively stronger core over time, the nature of which can be captured by a β profile that has a simple dependence on redshift. In contrast, the hot gas that will cool over a time-step is broadly consistent with a singular isothermal sphere.We find that cooling gas carries a few times the specific angular momentum of the halo and is offset in spin direction from the rest of the hot gas. The gas loses {\textasciitilde}60 per cent of its specific angular momentum during the cooling process, generally remaining greater than that of the halo, and it precesses to become aligned with the cold gas already in the disc.We find tentative evidence that angular-momentum losses are slightly larger when gas cools on to dispersion-supported galaxies.We show that an exponential surface density profile for gas arriving on a disc remains a reasonable approximation, but a cusp containing {\textasciitilde}20 per cent of the mass is always present, and disc scale radii are larger than predicted by a vanilla Fall \& Efstathiou model. These scale radii are still closely correlated with the halo spin parameter, for which we suggest an updated prescription for galaxy formation models.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02193},
	abstract = {One of the key open questions in extragalactic astronomy is what stops star formation in galaxies. While it is clear that the cold gas reservoir, which fuels the formation of new stars, must be affected first, how this happens and what are the dominant physical mechanisms involved is still a matter of debate. At least for satellite galaxies, it is generally accepted that internal processes alone cannot be responsible for fully quenching their star formation, but that environment should play an important, if not dominant, role. In nearby clusters, we see examples of cold gas being removed from the star-forming disks of galaxies moving through the intracluster medium, but whether active stripping is widespread and/or necessary to halt star formation in satellites, or quenching is just a consequence of the inability of these galaxies to replenish their cold gas reservoirs, remains unclear. In this work, we review the current status of environmental studies of cold gas in star-forming satellites in the local Universe from an observational perspective, focusing on the evidence for a physical link between cold gas stripping and quenching of the star formation. We find that stripping of cold gas is ubiquitous in satellite galaxies in both group and cluster environments. While hydrodynamical mechanisms such as ram pressure are important, the emerging picture across the full range of dark matter halos and stellar masses is a complex one, where different physical mechanisms may act simultaneously and cannot always be easily separated. Most importantly, we show that stripping does not always lead to full quenching, as only a fraction of the cold gas reservoir might be affected at the first pericentre passage. We argue that this is a key point to reconcile apparent tensions between statistical and detailed analyses of satellite galaxies...(abridged)},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01182},
	abstract = {Quantitative estimates of the basic properties of the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}), such as its density and metallicity, depend on the spectrum of incident {UV} background radiation. Models of {UV} background are known to have large variations, mainly because they are synthesized using poorly constrained parameters, which introduce uncertainty in the inferred properties of the {CGM}. Here, we quantify this uncertainty using a large set of new {UV} background models with physically motivated toy models of metal-enriched {CGM}. We find that, the inferred density and metallicity of low-density (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$) gas is uncertain by factors of 6.3 and 3.7, whereas high density (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$) gas by factors of 3.3 and 2.2, respectively. The variation in the shape of the {UV} background models is entirely responsible for such a variation in the metallicity while variation in the density arises from both normalization and shape of the {UV} background. Moreover, we find a harder (softer) {UV} background infers higher (lower) density and metallicity. We also study warm-hot gas at \$T= 10{\textasciicircum}\{5.5\}\$ K and find that metallicity is robustly estimated but the inferred density is uncertain by a factor of 3 to 5.4 for low to high-density gas. Such large uncertainties in density and metallicity may severely limit the studies of the {CGM} and demand better observational constraints on the input parameters used in synthesizing {UV} background.},

	abstract = {The complex structure of gas, metals, and dust in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium ({ISM} and {CGM}, respectively) in star-forming galaxies can be probed by Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission and absorption, low-ionization interstellar ({LIS}) metal absorption, and dust reddening \$E(B-V)\$. We present a statistical analysis of the correlations among Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ equivalent width ({EW}\$\_\{Ly{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$), {LIS} equivalent width ({EW}\$\_\{{LIS}\}\$), and \$E(B-V)\$ in a sample of 159 star-forming galaxies at \$z{\textbackslash}sim2.3\$. With measurements obtained from individual, deep rest-{UV} spectra and spectral-energy distribution ({SED}) modeling, we find that the tightest correlation exists between {EW}\$\_\{{LIS}\}\$ and \$E(B-V)\$, although correlations among all three parameters are statistically significant. These results signal a direct connection between dust and metal-enriched {HI} gas, and that they are likely co-spatial. By comparing our results with the predictions of different {ISM}/{CGM} models, we favor a clumpy {ISM}/{CGM} model where dust resides in neutral gas clumps and Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ photons escape through the low {HI} covering fraction/column density intra-clump medium. Finally, we investigate the factors that potentially contribute to the intrinsic scatter in the correlations studied in this work, including metallicity, outflow kinematics, Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ production efficiency, and slit loss. Specifically, we find evidence that scatter in the relationship between {EW}\$\_\{Ly{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ and \$E(B-V)\$ reflects the variation in metal-to-{HI} covering fraction ratio as a function of metallicity, and the effects of outflows on the porosity of the {ISM}/{CGM}. Future simulations incorporating star-formation feedback and the radiative transfer of Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ photons will provide key constraints on the spatial distributions of neutral gas and dust in the {ISM}/{CGM} structure.},

N-body dynamics is computed with a 4th-order Hermite integrator. We systematically investigate the impact of stellar feedback on the self-gravitating {ISM} with magnetic fields, {CR} advection and diffusion and non-equilibrium chemical evolution. {SN}-only feedback results in strongly clustered star formation with very high star cluster masses, a bi-modal distribution of the ambient {SN} densities, and low volume-filling factors ({VFF}) of warm gas, typically inconsistent with local conditions. Early radiative feedback prevents an initial starburst, reduces star cluster masses and outflow rates. Furthermore, star formation rate surface densities of \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}star\} = 1.4-5.9 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, {VFF}\$\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{warm\} = 60-80\$ per cent as well as thermal, kinetic, magnetic, and cosmic ray energy densities of the model including all feedback mechanisms agree well with observational constraints. On the short, 100 Myr, timescales investigated here, {CRs} only have a moderate impact on star formation and the multi-phase gas structure and result in cooler outflows, if present. Our models indicate that at low gas surface densities {SN}-only feedback only captures some characteristics of the star-forming {ISM} and outflows/inflows relevant for regulating star formation. Instead, star formation is regulated on star cluster scales by radiation and winds from massive stars in clusters, whose peak masses agree with solar neighbourhood estimates.},

We explore the sensitivity of this decorrelation to different processes controlling the structure of the interstellar medium, the abundance of molecular gas, star formation, and feedback in a suite of simulations of an isolated dwarf galaxy with structural properties similar to {NGC}300 that self-consistently model radiative transfer and molecular chemistry. Our fiducial simulation reproduces the magnitude of decorrelation and its scale dependence measured in {NGC}300, and we show that this agreement is due to different aspects of feedback, including H\$\_2\$ dissociation, gas heating by the locally variable {UV} field, early mechanical feedback, and supernovae. In particular, early radiative and mechanical feedback affect the correlation on \${\textbackslash}lesssim 100\$ pc scales, while supernovae play a significant role on \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 100\$ pc scales. The correlation is also sensitive to the choice of the local star formation efficiency per freefall time, \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$, which provides a strong observational constraint on \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ when the global star formation rate is independent of its value.

	abstract = {The difference in shape between the observed galaxy stellar mass function and the predicted dark matter halo mass function is generally explained primarily by feedback processes. Feedback can shape the stellar-halo mass ({SHM}) relation by driving gas out of galaxies, by modulating the first-time infall of gas onto galaxies (i.e., preventative feedback), and by instigating fountain flows of recycled wind material. We present a novel method to disentangle these effects for hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. We build a model of linear coupled differential equations that by construction reproduces the flows of gas onto and out of galaxies and haloes in the {EAGLE} cosmological simulation. By varying individual terms in this model, we isolate the relative effects of star formation, ejection via outflow, first-time inflow and wind recycling on the {SHM} relation. We find that for halo masses \$M\_\{200\} {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ the {SHM} relation is shaped primarily by a combination of ejection from galaxies and haloes, while for larger \$M\_\{200\}\$ preventative feedback is also important. The effects of recycling and the efficiency of star formation are small. We show that if, instead of \$M\_\{200\}\$, we use the cumulative mass of dark matter that fell in for the first time, the evolution of the {SHM} relation nearly vanishes. This suggests that the evolution is due to the definition of halo mass rather than to an evolving physical efficiency of galaxy formation. Finally, we demonstrate that the mass in the circum-galactic medium is much more sensitive to gas flows, especially recycling, than is the case for stars and the interstellar medium.},

We characterize these flows in eight galaxies -- mostly {AGN} -- selected for their widespread {NaI} D signatures from the Siding Spring Southern Seyfert Spectroscopic Snapshot Survey (S7). This survey employs deep, wide field-of-view integral field spectroscopy at moderate spectral resolution (R=7000 at {NaI} D). We significantly expand the sample of sightlines in external galaxies in which the spatially-resolved relationship has been studied between cool, neutral gas properties -- N({NaI}), Weq({NaI} D) -- and dust -- E(B-V) from both stars and gas. Our sample shows strong, significant correlations of total Weq with E(B-V)\_stars and g-i colour within individual galaxies; correlations with E(B-V)\_gas are present but weaker. Regressions yield slope variations from galaxy to galaxy and intrinsic scatter {\textasciitilde}1 Angstrom. The sample occupies regions in the space of N({NaI}) and Weq{\textasciicircum}abs vs. E(B-V)\_gas that are consistent with extrapolations from other studies to higher colour excess [E(B-V)\_gas {\textasciitilde} 1]. For perhaps the first time in external galaxies, we detect inverse P Cygni profiles in the {NaI} D line, presumably due to inflowing gas. Via Doppler shifted {NaI} D absorption and emission lines, we find ubiquitous flows that differ from stellar rotation by {\textgreater}100 km/s or have {\textbar}v,abs - v,em{\textbar} {\textgreater} 100 km/s. Inflows and outflows extend toward the edge of the detected stellar disk/{FOV}, together subtend 10-40\% of the projected disk, and have similar mean N({NaI}) and Weq({NaI} D). Outflows are consistent with minor-axis or jet-driven flows, while inflows tend toward the projected major axis. The inflows may result from non-axisymmetric potentials, tidal motions, or halo infall.},

	abstract = {We characterize mass, momentum, energy and metal outflow rates of multi-phase galactic winds in a suite of {FIRE}-2 cosmological "zoom-in" simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments ({FIRE}) project. We analyze simulations of low-mass dwarfs, intermediate-mass dwarfs, Milky Way-mass halos, and high-redshift massive halos. Consistent with previous work, we find that dwarfs eject about 100 times more gas from their interstellar medium ({ISM}) than they form in stars, while this mass "loading factor" drops below one in massive galaxies. Most of the mass is carried by the hot phase (\${\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}5\$ K) in massive halos and the warm phase (\$10{\textasciicircum}3-10{\textasciicircum}5\$ K) in dwarfs; cold outflows (\${\textless}10{\textasciicircum}3\$ K) are negligible except in high-redshift dwarfs. Energy, momentum and metal loading factors from the {ISM} are of order unity in dwarfs and significantly lower in more massive halos. Hot outflows have \$2-5{\textbackslash}times\$ higher specific energy than needed to escape from the gravitational potential of dwarf halos; indeed, in dwarfs, the mass, momentum, and metal outflow rates increase with radius whereas energy is roughly conserved, indicating swept up halo gas. Instantaneous mass loading factors tend to be larger during more powerful starbursts and when the inner halo is not virialized, but we see effectively no trend with the dense {ISM} gas fraction. We discuss how our results can guide future controlled numerical experiments that aim to elucidate the key parameters governing galactic winds and the resulting preventative feedback.},

	abstract = {The warm absorbers observed in more than half of all nearby active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) are tracers of ionized outflows located at parsec scale distances from the central engine. If the smallest inferred ionization parameters correspond to plasma at a few \$10{\textasciicircum}4\${\textasciitilde}K, then the gas undergoes a transition from being bound to unbound provided it is further heated to \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}6\${\textasciitilde}K at larger radii. Dannen et al. recently discovered that under these circumstances, thermally driven wind solutions are unsteady and even show very dense clumps due to thermal instability. To explore the observational consequences of these new wind solutions, we compute line profiles based on the one-dimensional simulations of Dannen et al. We show how the line profiles from even a simple steady state wind solution depend on the ionization energy ({IE}) of absorbing ions, which is a reflection of the wind ionization stratification. To organize the diversity of the line shapes, we group them into four categories: weak Gaussians, saturated boxy profiles with and without an extended blue wing, and broad weak profiles. The lines with profiles in the last two categories are produced by ions with the highest {IE} that probe the fastest regions. Their maximum blueshifts agree with the highest flow velocities in thermally unstable models, both steady state and clumpy versions. In contrast, the maximum blueshifts of the most high {IE} lines in thermally stable models can be less than half of the actual solution velocities. Clumpy solutions can additionally imprint distinguishable absorption troughs at widely separated velocities.},

The following results are derived. (i) The diffusion rate in the particulate gas after recombination is sub-anomalous, with a rapid decay of particle velocities.

	abstract = {X-ray studies of jellyfish galaxies play a crucial role in understanding the interactions between the interstellar medium ({ISM}) and the intracluster medium ({ICM}). In this paper, we focused on the jellyfish galaxy {JO}201. By combining archival Chandra observations, {MUSE} H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ cubes, and maps of the emission fraction of the diffuse ionised gas, we investigated both its high energy spectral properties and the spatial correlation between its X-ray and optical emissions. The X-ray emission of {JO}201 is provided by both the Compton thick {AGN} (L\$\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{X\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{0.5-10 {\textbackslash}text\{{keV}\}\}\$=2.7\${\textbackslash}cdot\$10\${\textasciicircum}\{41\}\$ erg s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, not corrected for intrinsic absorption) and an extended component (L\$\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{X\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{0.5-10 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}text\{{keV}\}\}{\textbackslash}approx\$1.9-4.5\${\textbackslash}cdot\$10\${\textasciicircum}\{41\}\$ erg s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) produced by a warm plasma ({kT}\${\textbackslash}approx\$1 {keV}), whose luminosity is higher than expected from the observed star formation (L\$\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{X\}\}{\textbackslash}sim\$3.8\${\textbackslash}cdot10{\textasciicircum}\{40\}\$ erg s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$). The spectral analysis showed that the X-ray emission is consistent with the thermal cooling of hot plasma. These properties are similar to the ones found in other jellyfish galaxies showing extended X-ray emission. A point-to-point analysis revealed that this X-ray emission closely follows the {ISM} distribution, whereas {CLOUDY} simulations proved that the ionisation triggered by this warm plasma would be able to reproduce the [{OI}]/H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ excess observed in {JO}201. We conclude that the galactic X-ray emitting plasma is originated on the surface of the {ISM} as a result of the {ICM}-{ISM} interplay. This process would entail the cooling and accretion of the {ICM} onto the galaxy, which could additionally fuel the star formation, and the emergence of [{OI}]/H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ excess in the optical spectrum.},

	abstract = {In this work, we investigate the strength and impact of ionised gas outflows within \$z {\textbackslash}sim 0.04\$ {MaNGA} galaxies. We find evidence for outflows in 322 galaxies (\$12{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the analysed line-emitting sample), 185 of which show evidence for {AGN} activity. Most outflows are centrally concentrated with a spatial extent that scales sublinearly with \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}\$. The incidence of outflows is enhanced at higher masses, central surface densities and deeper gravitational potentials, as well as at higher {SFR} and {AGN} luminosity. We quantify strong correlations between mass outflow rates and the mechanical drivers of the outflow of the form \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm out\} {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}rm {SFR}{\textasciicircum}\{0.97\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm out\} {\textbackslash}propto L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {AGN}\}{\textasciicircum}\{0.55\}\$. We derive a master scaling relation describing the mass outflow rate of ionised gas as a function of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$, {SFR}, \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}\$ and \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {AGN}\}\$. Most of the observed winds are anticipated to act as galactic fountains, with the fraction of galaxies with escaping winds increasing with decreasing potential well depth. We further investigate the physical properties of the outflowing gas finding evidence for enhanced attenuation in the outflow, possibly due to metal-enriched winds, and higher excitation compared to the gas in the galactic disk. Given that the majority of previous studies have focused on more extreme systems with higher {SFRs} and/or more luminous {AGN}, our study provides a unique view of the non-gravitational gaseous motions within `typical' galaxies in the low-redshift Universe, where low-luminosity {AGN} and star formation contribute jointly to the observed outflow phenomenology.},

An important systematic that has never before been quantified concerns model non-uniqueness; the absorption component structure is generally complicated, comprising many blended lines. This characteristic means any given system can be fitted equally well by many slightly different models, each having a different value of {\textbackslash}alpha, the fine structure constant. We use {AI} Monte Carlo modelling to quantify non-uniqueness and describe how it accounts for previously unexplained scatter seen in the majority of published measurements. Extensive supercomputer calculations are reported, revealing new systematic effects that guide future analyses: (i) systematic errors significantly increase if line broadening models are turbulent but are minimised if gas temperature is included as a free parameter; modelling quasar absorption systems using turbulent broadening should be avoided and compound broadening is preferable. (ii) The general overfitting tendency of {AICc} dramatically increases non-uniqueness and hence the overall error budget on estimates of {\textbackslash}alpha variations. The newly introduced Spectral Information Criterion ({SpIC}) statistic is more suitable and substantially decreases non-uniqueness compared to {AICc}-based models.},

	abstract = {We present multi-band Hubble Space Telescope imaging that spans rest-frame near-ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths (0.3-1.1 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m) for 12 compact starburst galaxies at z=0.4-0.8. These massive galaxies (M\_stellar {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}11 M\_Sun) are driving very fast outflows (\$v\_\{max\}\$=1000-3000 km/s), and their light profiles are dominated by an extremely compact starburst component (half-light radius {\textasciitilde} 100 pc). Our goal is to constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for launching these fast outflows by measuring the physical conditions within the central kiloparsec. Based on our stellar population analysis, the central component typically contributes \${\textbackslash}approx\$25\% of the total stellar mass and the central escape velocities \$v\_\{esc,central\}{\textbackslash}approx900\$ km/s are a factor of two smaller than the observed outflow velocities. This requires physical mechanisms that can accelerate gas to speeds significantly beyond the central escape velocities, and it makes clear that these fast outflows are capable of traveling into the circumgalactic medium, and potentially beyond. We find central stellar densities comparable to theoretical estimates of the Eddington limit, and we estimate \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_1\$ surface densities within the central kpc comparable to those of compact massive galaxies at \$0.5{\textless}z{\textless}3.0\$. Relative to "red nuggets" and "blue nuggets" at \$z{\textbackslash}sim2\$, we find significantly smaller \$r\_e\$ values at a given stellar mass, which we attribute to the dominance of a young stellar component in our sample and the better physical resolution for rest-frame optical observations at \$z{\textbackslash}sim0.6\$ versus \$z{\textbackslash}sim2\$. We compare to theoretical scenarios involving major mergers and violent disc instability, and we speculate that our galaxies are progenitors of power-law ellipticals in the local universe with prominent stellar cusps.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11510},
	abstract = {The hot component of the circum-galactic medium ({CGM}) around star forming galaxies is detected as diffuse X-ray emission. The X-ray spectra from the {CGM} depend on the temperature and metallicity of the emitting plasma, providing important information about the feeding and feedback of the galaxy. The observed spectra are commonly fitted using simple 1-Temperature (1-T) or 2-T models. However, the actual temperature distribution of the gas can be complex because of the interaction between galactic outflows and halo gas. Here we demonstrate this by analysing 3-D hydrodynamical simulations of the {CGM} with a realistic outflow model. We investigate the physical properties of the simulated hot {CGM}, which shows a broad distribution in density, temperature, and metallicity. By constructing and fitting the simulated spectra, we show that, while the 1-T and 2-T models are able to fit the synthesized spectra reasonably well, the inferred temperature(s) bear little physical meaning. Instead, we propose a log-normal distribution as a more physical model. The log-normal model better fits the simulated spectra while reproducing the gas temperature distribution. We also show that when the star formation rate is high, the spectra inside the bi-conical outflows are distinct from that outside, as outflows are generally hotter and more metal-enriched.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10187},
	abstract = {We investigate the connection between galactic outflows and star formation using two independent data sets covering a sample of 22 galaxies between \$1 {\textbackslash}lesssim z {\textbackslash}lesssim 1.5\$. The {HST} {WFC}3/G141 grism provides low spectral resolution, high spatial resolution spectroscopy yielding H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission line maps from which we measure the spatial extent and strength of star formation. In the rest-frame near-{UV}, Keck/{DEIMOS} observes Fe {II} and Mg {II} interstellar absorption lines, which provide constraints on the intensity and velocity of the outflows. We compare outflow properties from individual and composite spectra with the star formation rate ({SFR}) and {SFR} surface density ({SigmaSFR}), as well as the stellar mass and specific star formation rate ({sSFR}). The Fe {II} and Mg {II} equivalent widths ({EWs}) increase with both {SFR} and {SigmaSFR} at \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance, while the composite spectra show larger Fe {II} {EWs} and outflow velocities in galaxies with higher {SFR}, {SigmaSFR}, and {sSFR}. Absorption line profiles of the composite spectra further indicate that the differences between subsamples are driven by outflows rather than the {ISM}. While these results are consistent with those of previous studies, the use of H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ images makes them the most direct test of the relationship between star formation and outflows at \$z{\textgreater}1\$ to date. Future facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the upcoming Extremely Large Telescopes will extend these direct, H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$-based studies to lower masses and star formation rates, probing galactic feedback across orders of magnitude in galaxy properties and augmenting the correlations we find here.},

	title = {The role of gas kinematics in setting metallicity gradients at high redshift},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09740},
	abstract = {In this work, we explore the diversity of ionised gas kinematics (rotational velocity \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}phi\}\$ and velocity dispersion \${\textbackslash}sigma\_g\$) and gas-phase metallicity gradients at \$0.1 {\textbackslash}leq z {\textbackslash}leq 2.5\$ using a compiled data set of 74 galaxies resolved with ground-based integral field spectroscopy. We find that galaxies with the highest and the lowest \${\textbackslash}sigma\_g\$ have preferentially flat metallicity gradients, whereas those with intermediate values of \${\textbackslash}sigma\_g\$ show a large scatter in the metallicity gradients. Additionally, steep negative gradients appear almost only in rotation-dominated galaxies (\$v\_\{{\textbackslash}phi\}/{\textbackslash}sigma\_g {\textgreater} 1\$), whereas most dispersion-dominated galaxies show flat gradients. We use our recently developed analytic model of metallicity gradients to provide a physical explanation for these observed trends. In the case of high \${\textbackslash}sigma\_g\$, the inward radial advection of gas dominates over metal production and causes efficient metal mixing, thus giving rise to flat gradients. For low \${\textbackslash}sigma\_g\$, it is the cosmic accretion of metal-poor gas diluting the metallicity that gives rise to flat gradients. Finally, the reason for intermediate \${\textbackslash}sigma\_g\$ showing the steepest negative gradients is that both inward radial advection and cosmic accretion are weak as compared to metal production, which leads to the creation of steeper gradients. The larger scatter at intermediate \${\textbackslash}sigma\_g\$ may be due in part to preferential ejection of metals in galactic winds, which can decrease the strength of the production term. Our analysis shows that gas kinematics plays a critical role in setting metallicity gradients in high-redshift galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present the first set of cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations of galaxies including dissipative self-interacting dark matter ({dSIDM}). These simulations utilize the Feedback In Realistic Environments ({FIRE}-2) galaxy formation physics, but allow the dark matter to have dissipative self-interactions analogous to Standard Model forces, parameterized by the self-interaction cross-section per unit mass, \$({\textbackslash}sigma/m)\$, and the dimensionless degree of dissipation, \$0{\textless}f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm diss\}{\textless}1\$. We survey this parameter space, including constant and velocity-dependent cross-sections, and focus on structural and kinematic properties of dwarf galaxies with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\} {\textbackslash}simeq 10{\textasciicircum}\{10-11\} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. Central density profiles of simulated dwarfs become cuspy when \$({\textbackslash}sigma/m)\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.1{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash},g{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ (and \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm diss\}=0.5\$ as fiducial). The power-law slopes asymptote to \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}approx -1.5\$ in low-mass dwarfs independent of cross-section, which arises from a dark matter ``cooling flow''. Through comparisons with dark matter only simulations, we find the profile in this regime is insensitive to the inclusion of baryons. However, when \$({\textbackslash}sigma/m)\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} {\textbackslash}ll 0.1{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash},g{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$, baryonic effects can produce cored density profiles comparable to non-dissipative cold dark matter ({CDM}) runs but at smaller radii. Simulated galaxies with \$({\textbackslash}sigma/m) {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash},g{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ develop significant coherent rotation of dark matter, accompanied by halo deformation, but this is unlike the well-defined thin ``dark disks'' often attributed to baryon-like {dSIDM}. The density profiles in this high cross-section model exhibit lower normalizations given the onset of halo deformation. For our surveyed {dSIDM} parameters, halo masses and galaxy stellar masses do not show appreciable difference from {CDM}, but dark matter kinematics and halo concentrations/shapes can differ.},

Aims. We present optical longslit spectra for a subset of the {xGASS} and {xCOLD} {GASS} galaxies to investigate the correlation between radial metallicity profiles and cold gas content. In addition to data from Moran et al. (2012), this paper presents new optical spectra for 27 galaxies in the stellar mass range of 9.0 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ log Mstar/Msun \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 10.0. Methods. The longslit spectra were taken along the major axis of the galaxies, allowing us to obtain radial profiles of the gas-phase oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H)). The slope of a linear fit to these radial profiles is defined as the metallicity gradient. We investigated correlations between these gradients and global galaxy properties, such as star formation activity and gas content. In addition, we examined the correlation of local metallicity measurements and the global {HI} mass fraction. Results. We obtained two main results: (i) the local metallicity is correlated with the global {HI} mass fraction, which is in good agreement with previous results. A simple toy model suggests that this correlation points towards a 'local gas regulator model'; (ii) the primary driver of metallicity gradients appears to be stellar mass surface density (as a proxy for morphology). Conclusions. This work comprises one of the few systematic observational studies of the influence of the cold gas on the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies, as considered via metallicity gradients and local measurements of the gas-phase oxygen abundance. Our results suggest that local density and local {HI} mass fraction are drivers of chemical evolution and the gas-phase metallicity.},

A prevalent approach is to parameterise the expansion history through the equation of state, \${\textbackslash}omega(z)\$. We present a parametric form for \${\textbackslash}omega(z)\$ that can reproduce the generic behaviour of the most widely used physical models for accelerated expansion with infrared corrections. The present proposal has at most 3 free parameters which can be mapped back to specific archetypal models for dark energy. We analyze in detail how different combinations of data can constrain the specific cases embedded in our form for \${\textbackslash}omega(z)\$. We implement our parametric equation for \${\textbackslash}omega(z)\$ to observations from {CMB}, luminous distance of {SNeIa}, cosmic chronometers, and baryon acoustic oscillations identified in galaxies and in the Lymann-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest. We find that the parameters can be well constrained by using different observational data sets. Our findings point to an oscillatory behaviour which is consistent with an \$f(R)\$-like model or an unknown combination of scalar fields. When we let the three parameters vary freely, we find an {EOS} which oscillates around the phantom-dividing line, and, with over 99\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of confidence, the cosmological constant solution is disfavored.},

	abstract = {The circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) contains information on gas flows around galaxies, such as accretion and supernova-driven winds, which are difficult to constrain from observations alone. Here, we use the high-resolution {TNG}50 cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation to study the properties and kinematics of the {CGM} around star-forming galaxies in \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash};M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ halos at \$z{\textbackslash}simeq1\$ using mock {MgII} absorption lines, which we generate by post-processing halos to account for photoionization in the presence of a {UV} background. We find that the {MgII} gas is a very good tracer of the cold {CGM}, which is accreting inwards at an inflow velocity of \${\textbackslash}sim\$50 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. For sightlines aligned with the galaxy's major axis, we find that {MgII} absorption lines are kinematically shifted due to the cold {CGM}'s significant corotation at speeds up to 50\% of the virial velocity for impact parameters up to 60 kpc. We compare mock {MgII} spectra to observations from the {MusE} {GAs} {FLow} and Wind ({MEGAFLOW}) survey of strong {MgII} absorbers (\${EW}{\textasciicircum}\{2796{\textbackslash}r\{A\}\}\_\{0\}{\textgreater}0.5 {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}r\{A\}\$). After matching the equivalent width ({EW}) selection, we find that the mock {MgII} spectra reflect the diversity of observed kinematics and {EWs} from {MEGAFLOW}, even though the sightlines probe a very small fraction of the {CGM}. {MgII} absorption in higher-mass halos is stronger and broader than in lower-mass halos but has qualitatively similar kinematics. The median specific angular momentum of the {MgII} {CGM} gas in {TNG}50 is very similar to that of the entire {CGM} and only differs from non-{CGM} components of the halo by normalization factors of \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$ 1 dex.},

	abstract = {Outflows driven by active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) are expected to have a significant impact on the host galaxy evolution, but it is still debated how they are accelerated and propagate on galaxy-wide scales. This work addresses these questions by studying the link between X-ray, nuclear ultra-fast outflows ({UFOs}) and extended ionised outflows, for the first time in two quasars close to the peak of {AGN} activity (\$z{\textbackslash}sim2\$), where {AGN} feedback is expected to be more effective. As targets, we selected two multiple-lensed quasars at \$z{\textbackslash}sim1.5\$, {HS} 0810+2554 and {SDSS} J1353+1138, known to host {UFOs} and observed with the near-{IR} integral field spectrometer {SINFONI} at the {VLT}. We performed a kinematical analysis of the [O {III}]\${\textbackslash}lambda\$5007 optical emission line, in order to trace the presence of ionised outflows. We detected spatially resolved ionised outflows in both galaxies, extended more than 8 kpc and moving up to \$v{\textgreater}2000\$ km/s. We derived mass outflow rates of \${\textbackslash}sim\$12 M\$\_\{sun\}\$/yr and \${\textbackslash}sim\$2 M\$\_\{sun\}\$/yr for {HS} 0810+2554 and {SDSS} J1353+1138. Comparing with the co-hosted {UFO} energetics, the ionised outflow energetics in {HS} 0810+2554 is broadly consistent with a momentum-driven regime of wind propagation, while in {SDSS} J1353+1138 it differs by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim\$100 from theoretical predictions, requiring either a massive molecular outflow or a high variability of the {AGN} activity to account for such a discrepancy. By additionally considering our results with those from the small sample of well-studied objects (all local but one), with both {UFO} and extended (ionised/atomic/molecular) outflow detections, we found that in 10 out of 12 galaxies the large-scale outflow energetics is consistent with the theoretical predictions of either a momentum- or an energy-driven scenario. This suggests that such models explain relatively well the acceleration mechanism of {AGN}-driven winds on large scales.},

The galaxy sample is from the 4th data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey ({KiDS}). The {tSZ} \$y\$ map and the {CMB} lensing map are from the Planck 2015 and 2018 data releases, respectively. The measurements are performed in five redshift bins with \$z{\textbackslash}lesssim1\$. With these measurements, combining galaxy-{tSZ} and galaxy-{CMB} lensing cross-correlations allows us to break the degeneracy between galaxy bias and gas pressure bias, and hence constrain them simultaneously. In all redshift bins, the best-fit values of \${\textbackslash}left{\textbackslash}langle b\_\{y\} P\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{e\}\}{\textbackslash}right{\textbackslash}rangle\$ are at a level of \${\textbackslash}sim 0.3{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{meV}/cm{\textasciicircum}3\}\$ and increase slightly with redshift. The galaxy bias is consistent with unity in all the redshift bins. Our results are not sensitive to the non-linear details of the cross-correlation, which are smoothed out by the Planck beam. Our measurements are in agreement with previous measurements as well as with theoretical predictions. We also show that our conclusions are not changed when {CMB} lensing is replaced by galaxy lensing, which shows consistency of the two lensing signals despite their radically different redshift range. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using {CMB} lensing to calibrate the galaxy distribution such that the galaxy distribution can be used as a mass proxy without relying on the precise knowledge of the matter distribution.},

	abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origin Spectrograph ({COS}) {UV} line spectroscopy and integral-field unit observations of the intergalactic medium ({IGM}) in the Stephan's Quintet ({SQ}) galaxy group. {SQ} hosts a 30 kpc long shocked ridge triggered by a galaxy collision at a relative velocity of 1000 km/s, where large amounts of cold (10-100 K) and warm (100-5000 K) molecular gas coexist with a hot plasma. {COS} spectroscopy along five lines-of-sight, probing 1 kpc-diameter regions in the {IGM}, reveals very broad ({\textasciitilde}2000 km/s) and powerful Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line emission with complex line shapes. These Lyman-alpha line profiles are often similar to, or sometimes much broader than line profiles obtained in H\${\textbackslash}beta\$, [{CII}], and {CO} (1-0) emission along the same lines-of-sight. In these cases, the breadth of the Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission, compared with H\${\textbackslash}beta\$, implies resonance scattering. Line ratios of Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/H\${\textbackslash}beta\$ for the two {COS} pointings closest to the center of the shocked ridge are close to the Case B recombination value, suggesting that at these positions Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ photons escape through scattering in a low density medium free of dust. Some Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ spectra show suppressed velocity components compared with [{CII}] and H\${\textbackslash}beta\$, implying that some of the Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ photons are absorbed. Scattering indicates that the neutral gas of the {IGM} is clumpy, with multiple clumps along a given line of sight. Remarkably, over more than four orders of magnitude in temperature, the powers radiated by the multi-phase {IGM} in X-rays, Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$, H\$\_2\$, [{CII}] are comparable within a factor of a few. We suggest that both shocks and mixing layers co-exist and contribute to the energy dissipation associated with a turbulent energy cascade.

Gas within \$1\$ kpc of the disk midplane is vertically homogeneous to \${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.008\$ dex at all \$z {\textbackslash}leq 1.5\$. We find negative radial gradients (metallicity decreases with galactocentric radius) at all times, which steepen over time from \${\textbackslash}approx -0.01\$ dex kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at \$z = 1\$ (\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm lookback\} = 7.8\$ Gyr) to \${\textbackslash}approx -0.03\$ dex kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at \$z = 0\$, and which broadly agree with observations of the {MW}, M31, and nearby {MW}/M31-mass galaxies. Azimuthal variations at fixed radius are typically \$0.14\$ dex at \$z = 1\$, reducing to \$0.05\$ dex at \$z = 0\$. Thus, over time radial gradients become steeper while azimuthal variations become weaker (more homogeneous). As a result, azimuthal variations were larger than radial variations at \$z {\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.8\$ (\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm lookback\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 6.9\$ Gyr). Furthermore, elemental abundances are measurably homogeneous (to \${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.05\$ dex) across a radial range of \${\textbackslash}Delta R {\textbackslash}approx 3.5\$ kpc at \$z {\textbackslash}gtrsim 1\$ and \${\textbackslash}Delta R {\textbackslash}approx 1.7\$ kpc at \$z = 0\$.

	abstract = {Using \${HST}\$/{COS} observations of the twin quasar lines of sight Q\$0107-025\$A \${\textbackslash}\&\$ Q\$0107-025\$B, we report on the physical properties, chemical abundances and transverse sizes of gas in a multiple galaxy environment at \$z = 0.399\$ across a transverse separation of \$520\$ kpc. The absorber towards Q\$0107-025\$B has \${\textbackslash}log N(H I)/cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} {\textbackslash}approx 16.8\$ (partial Lyman limit) while the absorber towards the other sightline has \$N(H I) {\textbackslash}approx 2\$ dex lower. The O {VI} along both sightlines have comparable column densities and broad \$b\$-values, whereas the low ionization lines are considerably narrower. The low ionization gas is inconsistent with the O {VI} when modelled assuming photoionization in a single phase. Along both the lines-of-sight, O {VI} and coinciding broad H I are best explained through collisional ionization in a cooling plasma with solar metallicity. Ionization models infer \$1/10\$-th solar metallicity for the {pLLS} and solar metallicity for the lower column density absorber along the other sightline. Within \${\textbackslash}pm{\textasciitilde}250{\textasciitilde}km{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and \$2\$ Mpc of projected distance from the sightlines 12 galaxies are identified, of which 3 are within \$300\$ kpc. One of them is a dwarf galaxy while the other two are intermediate mass systems at impact parameters of \${\textbackslash}rho {\textbackslash}sim (1-4)R\_\{vir\}\$. The O {VI} along both lines-of-sight could be either tracing narrow transition temperature zones at the interface of low ionization gas and the hot halo of nearest galaxy, or a more spread-out warm gas bound to the circumgalactic halo/intragroup medium. This latter scenario leads to a warm gas mass limit of \$M {\textbackslash}gtrsim 4.5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$.},

	abstract = {Galactic outflows driven by starbursts can modify the galactic magnetic fields and drive them away from the galactic planes. Here, we quantify how these fields may magnetize the intergalactic medium. We estimate the strength and structure of the fields in the starburst galaxy M82 using thermal polarized emission observations from {SOFIA}/{HAWC}+ and a potential field extrapolation. We modified the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method to account for the large-scale flow and the turbulent field. Results show that the observed magnetic fields arise from the combination of a large-scale ordered potential field associated with the outflow and a small-scale turbulent field associated with bow-shock-like features. Within the central \$900\$ pc radius, the potential field accounts for \$53{\textbackslash}pm4\$\% of the observed turbulent magnetic energy with a median field strength of \$305{\textbackslash}pm15\$ \${\textbackslash}mu\$G, while small-scale turbulent magnetic fields account for the remaining \$40{\textbackslash}pm5\$\% with a median field strength of \$222{\textbackslash}pm19\$ \${\textbackslash}mu\$G. We estimate that the turbulent kinetic and turbulent magnetic energies are in close equipartition up to \${\textbackslash}sim2\$ kpc (measured), while the turbulent kinetic energy dominates at \${\textbackslash}sim7\$ kpc (extrapolated). We conclude that the fields are frozen into the ionized outflowing medium and driven away kinetically. This indicates that the magnetic field lines in the galactic wind of M82 are `open,' providing a direct channel between the starburst core and the intergalactic medium. Our novel approach offers the tools needed to quantify the effects of outflows on galactic magnetic fields as well as their influence on the intergalactic medium and evolution of energetic particles.},

The cosmological simulation was carried out with the {GADGET}-3 {TreePM}+{SPH} code using the {MUlti} Phase Particle Integrator ({MUPPI}) model. We disentangle the complex overlapping of stellar generations that rises from the top-down and inside-out formation of the galactic disc. We investigate cosmological signatures in the phase-space of mono-age populations and highlight features stemming from past and recent dynamical perturbations. In the simulation, we identify a satellite with a stellar mass of \$1.2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}9\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, i.e. stellar mass ratio \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}sim 5.5\$ per cent at the time, accreted at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 1.6\$, which resembles the major merger Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus that produced the Galactic thick disc, i.e. \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}sim 6\$ per cent.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02225},
	abstract = {(abridged) Data and results from the {WISH} key program are summarized, designed to provide a legacy data set to address its physics and chemistry. {WISH} targeted {\textasciitilde}80 sources along the two axes of luminosity and evolutionary stage: from low- to high-mass protostars and from pre-stellar cores to protoplanetary disks. Lines of H2O, {HDO}, {OH}, {CO} and [O I] were observed with the {HIFI} and {PACS} instruments, complemented by molecules that probe {UV}, X-ray or grain chemistry. Most of the far-infrared water emission from protostars is found to be compact, originating from warm outflowing and shocked gas at high density and temperature in at least two physical components. This gas is not probed by low-J {CO} lines, only by J{\textgreater}14. Water is a significant, but not dominant, coolant. Its abundance is universally low, of order H2O/H2=2E-6, pointing to shock and outflow cavity models that include {UV} radiation at 100-1000 times the {ISRF}. In cold quiescent pre-stellar cores and envelopes, the water abundance structure is accurately probed through velocity-resolved line profiles, confirming basic chemistry networks. The gaseous {HDO}/H2O ratio of 0.025, much higher than that of bulk ice, is representative of the outer photodesorbed ice layers and cold chemistry. Water abundances in the inner hot cores are high, but with variations from 5E-6 to 2E-4. Combined analyses of water gas and ice show that up to 50\% of the oxygen budget may be missing, with possible explanations discussed. Water vapor emission from disks is weak, indicating that water ice is locked up in larger pebbles early on and that these pebbles have settled and drifted inward by the Class {II} stage. Quantitatively, many oceans of water ice are available. Extragalactic low-J H2O emission is mostly compact and collisionally excited. Prospects for future mid- to far-infrared missions are given.},

	abstract = {Sulfur is a volatile chemical element that plays an important role in tracing the chemical evolution of galaxies. However, its nucleosynthesis origin and abundance variations are still unclear. The goal of the present article is to accurately and precisely study the S-content of large number of stars located in the solar neighbourhood. We use the parametrisation of thousands of {HR} stellar spectra provided by the {AMBRE} Project, and combine it with the automated abundance determination {GAUGUIN} to derive {LTE} sulfur abundances for 1855 slow-rotating {FGK}-type stars. This is the largest and most precise catalogue of S-abundances published to date. It covers a metallicity domain as high as {\textasciitilde}2.5dex starting at [M/H]{\textasciitilde}-2.0dex. We find that the [S/M] abundances ratio is compatible with a plateau-like distribution in the metal-poor regime, and then starts to decrease continuously at [M/H]{\textasciitilde}-1.0dex. This decrease continues towards negative values for supersolar metallicity stars as recently reported for Mg and as predicted by Galactic chemical evolution models. Moreover, sulfur-rich stars having [M/H] in the range [-1.0,-0.5] have very different kinematical and orbital properties with respect to more metal-rich and sulfur-poor ones. Two disc components, associated with the thin and thick discs, are thus seen independently in kinematics and sulfur abundances. The sulfur radial gradients in the Galactic discs have also been estimated. Finally, the enrichment in sulfur with respect to iron is nicely correlated with stellar ages: older metal-poor stars have higher [S/M] ratios than younger metal-rich ones. This work has confirmed that sulfur is an alfa-element that could be considered to explore the Galactic populations properties.},

	abstract = {The hot halo gas distribution in the inner Milky Way ({MW}) contains key fossil records of the past energetic feedback processes in the Galactic center, such as the Fermi and {eROSITA} bubbles. Here we adopt a variety of spherical and disk-like {MW} halo gas models as initial conditions in a series of simulations to investigate the formation of the Fermi bubbles in the jet-shock scenario. The simulation results are compared directly with relevant observations of the Fermi bubbles to constrain the halo gas distribution in the inner Galaxy before the Fermi bubble event. Our best-fit gas density distribution can be described by a power law in radius \$n\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}(r)=0.01(r/1 {\textbackslash}text\{{\textasciitilde}kpc\}){\textasciicircum}\{-1.5\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$.

When extrapolating to large radii \$r{\textbackslash}sim 50-90\$ kpc, our derived density distribution lies appreciably below the recently estimated gas densities from ram-pressure stripping calculations, suggesting that the halo gas density profile either flattens out or has one or more discontinuities within \$10 {\textbackslash}lesssim r {\textbackslash}lesssim 50\$ kpc.

Our analysis provides a new perspective to the understanding of the distribution and evolution of baryons across cosmic time and, in turn, gives new hints in the context of the well known missing baryons problem. In this work, the cosmic web components are identified using the local comoving dark matter density, which represents a simple and unique way of mapping baryons on large scales. Our results show that {MgII} and {CII} are mostly located in condensed gas in haloes in high-density, low-temperature, star-forming regions. The mass fractions of {CIV} and {SiIV}, on the other hand, show similar evolutionary trends in the different gas phases and cosmic web environments. Finally, our findings confirm the notion that {OVI}, {NeVIII}, and {NV} exist mainly in the form of diffuse and {WHIM} gas located in filaments, suggesting that these ionized metals are good tracers of warm/hot and low-density gas, regions that are likely to contain most of the missing baryons in the local Universe.},

	abstract = {We report on the possibility of studying the properties of cosmic diffuse baryons by studying self-gravitating clumps and filaments connected to galaxy clusters. While filaments are challenging to detect with X-ray observations, the higher density of clumps make them visible and a viable tracer to study the thermodynamical properties of baryons undergoing accretion along cosmic web filaments onto galaxy clusters. We developed new algorithms to identify these structures in a set of non-radiative high-resolution simulations of galaxy clusters, cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters. We show that the density and temperature of clumps are independent of the mass of the cluster where they reside. We detected a positive correlation between the filament temperature and the host cluster mass. Density and Temperature of clumps and filaments tend to correlate. Both decrease moving outward. We observe that clumps are hotter, more massive and more luminous if identified closer to the cluster center. Clumps and filaments contribute to {\textasciitilde}17 (1) per cent of the gas mass (volume) outside R500,c, with clumps contributing a factor of 2 more. Especially in the outermost cluster regions ({\textasciitilde}3*R500,c or beyond) X-ray observations might already have the chance of locating filaments based on the distribution of clumps, and by studying the thermodynamics of diffuse baryons before they are processed by the dynamical interaction with the host intracluster medium.},

	abstract = {We apply the Tremaine-Weinberg method to 19 nearby galaxies using stellar mass surface densities and velocities derived from the {PHANGS}-{MUSE} survey, to calculate (primarily bar) pattern speeds (\${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm P\}\$). After quality checks, we find that around half (10) of these stellar mass-based measurements are reliable. For those galaxies, we find good agreement between our results and previously published pattern speeds, and use rotation curves to calculate major resonance locations (co-rotation radii and Lindblad resonances). We also compare these stellar-mass derived pattern speeds with H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ (from {MUSE}) and {CO}(\$J=2\{-\}1\$) emission from the {PHANGS}-{ALMA} survey. We find that in the case of these clumpy {ISM} tracers, this method erroneously gives a signal that is simply the angular frequency at a representative radius set by the distribution of these clumps (\${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm clump\}\$), and that this \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm clump\}\$ is significantly different to \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm P\}\$ (\${\textbackslash}sim\$20\% in the case of H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$, and \${\textbackslash}sim\$50\% in the case of {CO}). Thus, we conclude that it is inadvisable to use "pattern speeds" derived from {ISM} kinematics. Finally, we compare our derived pattern speeds and co-rotation radii, along with bar properties, to the global parameters of these galaxies. Consistent with previous studies, we find that galaxies with a later Hubble type have a larger ratio of co-rotation radius to bar length, more molecular-gas rich galaxies have higher \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm P\}\$, and more bulge-dominated galaxies have lower \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm P\}\$. Unlike earlier works, however, there are no clear trends between the bar strength and \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm P\}\$, nor between the total stellar mass surface density and the pattern speed.},

Our method combines new measurements of disk orientation with previously described circumgalactic absorption in background quasar spectra. Two quantities, a position angle and an axis ratio, describe the projected shape of each galactic disk on the sky, leaving an ambiguity about which side of the minor axis is tipped toward the observer. This degeneracy regarding the 3D orientation of disks has compromised previous efforts to measure gas inflow speeds. We present {HST} and Keck/{LGSAO} imaging that resolves the spiral structure in five galaxies at redshift \$z{\textbackslash}approx0.2\$. We determine the sign of the disk inclination for four galaxies, under the assumption that spiral arms trail the rotation. We project models for both radial infall in the disk plane and circular orbits onto each quasar sightline. We compare the resulting line-of-sight velocities to the observed velocity range of Mg {II} absorption in spectra of background quasars, which intersect the disk plane at radii between 69 and 115 kpc. For two sightlines, we constrain the maximum radial inflow speeds as 30-40 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. We also rule out a velocity component from radial inflow in one sightline, suggesting that the structures feeding gas to these growing disks do not have unity covering factor. We recommend appropriate selection criteria for building larger samples of galaxy--quasar pairs that produce orientations sensitive to constraining inflow properties.},

The broad H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line traces a fast and massive ionized gas outflow characterized by a total mass, \${\textbackslash}log(M\_\{out\}[M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}]),\$ of 7.94 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.15, an outflowing velocity (V\$\_\{out\}\$) of 573 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 151 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, and an outflowing mass rate (\${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{out\}\$) of 44 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 20 M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. The presence of the outflow in {BOSS}-{EUVLG}1 is also supported by the identification of blueshifted {UV} absorption lines in low and high ionization states. The energy involved in the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ outflow can be explained by the ongoing star formation without the need for an Active Galactic Nucleus. The derived low mass loading factor (\${\textbackslash}eta\$= 0.05 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.03) indicates that although massive, this phase of the outflow can not be relevant for the quenching of the star formation. In addition, only a small fraction (\${\textbackslash}leq\$ 15\%) of the ionized outflowing material with velocities above 372 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ could escape the gravitational potential, and enrich the surrounding circum-galactic medium at distances above tens of kpc. The ionized phase of the outflow does not carry the mass and energy to play a relevant role neither in the evolution of the host galaxy nor in the enrichment of the intergalactic medium. Other phases of the outflow could be carrying most of the outflow energy and mass in the form of hot X-ray emitting gas as predicted by some recent simulations. The expected emission of the extended X-ray emitting halo associated with the outflow in {BOSS}-{EUVLG}1 and similar galaxies could be detected with the future X-ray observatory, \{{\textbackslash}it {ATHENA}\} but could not be resolved spatially.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00132},
	abstract = {We analyse two analytic fitting profiles to model the ram pressure exerted over satellites galaxies for different environments and epochs, using hydrodynamical resimulations of groups and clusters of galaxies to measure the ram pressure from the gas particle distribution. First, we compare the predictions given by a known \${\textbackslash}beta\$-profile model with the simulation measurements, finding that the profile is not in agreement with the expected behaviour by missing the dependence with the halo mass and halocentric distance. It features a systematic underestimation of the predicted ram pressure at high redshifts (\$z {\textgreater} 1.5\$), which increases towards the central regions of the halos and it is independent of halo mass, reaching differences larger than two decades for satellites at \$r {\textless} 0.4 R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\$. This behaviour reverses as redshift decreases, featuring an increasing over-estimation with halocentric distance at \$z = 0\$. As an alternative, we introduce a new universal analytic model for the profiles consisting in a damped power law, and we provide a new set of fitted parameters which can recover the ram pressure dependence on halo mass and redshifts. Finally, we analyse the impact of these analytic profiles in the galaxy properties by applying a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and evolution on top of the simulations. We find the number of galaxies experiencing large amounts of accumulated ram pressure stripping have low stellar mass (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}leq 10{\textasciicircum}9 {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), and their specific star formation rates depend significantly on the ram pressure modelling, particularly at high redshifts (\$z {\textgreater} 1.5\$).},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00056},
	abstract = {Both observations and recent numerical simulations of the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) support the hypothesis that a self-regulating feedback loop suspends the gas density of the ambient {CGM} close to the galaxy in a state with a ratio of cooling time to freefall time {\textgreater}10. This limiting ratio is thought to arise because circumgalactic gas becomes increasingly susceptible to multiphase condensation as the ratio declines. If the timescale ratio gets too small, then cold clouds precipitate out of the {CGM}, rain into the galaxy, and fuel energetic feedback that raises the ambient cooling time. The astrophysical origin of this so-called precipitation limit is not simple but is critical to understanding the {CGM} and its role in galaxy evolution. This paper therefore attempts to interpret its origin as simply as possible, relying mainly on conceptual reasoning and schematic diagrams. It illustrates how the precipitation limit can depend on both the global configuration of a galactic atmosphere and the degree to which dynamical disturbances drive {CGM} perturbations. It also frames some tests of the precipitation hypothesis that can be applied to both {CGM} observations and numerical simulations of galaxy evolution.},

	abstract = {In the two-phase scenario of galaxy formation, a galaxy's stellar mass growth is first dominated by in-situ star formation, and subsequently by accretion. We analyse the radial distribution of the accreted stellar mass in {\textasciitilde}500 galaxies from the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Magneticum. Generally, we find good agreement with other simulations in that higher mass galaxies have larger accreted fractions, but we predict higher accretion fractions for low-mass galaxies. Based on the radial distribution of the accreted and in-situ components, we define 6 galaxy classes, from completely accretion dominated to completely in-situ dominated, and measure the transition radii between in-situ and accretion-dominated regions for galaxies that have such a transition. About 70\% of our galaxies have one transition radius. However, we also find about 10\% of the galaxies to be accretion dominated everywhere, and about 13\% to have two transition radii, with the centre and the outskirts both being accretion dominated. We show that these classes are strongly correlated with the galaxy merger histories, especially with the mergers' cold gas fractions. We find high total in-situ (low accretion) fractions to be associated with smaller, lower mass galaxies, lower central dark matter fractions, and larger transition radii. Finally, we show that the dips in observed surface brightness profiles seen in many early-type galaxies do not correspond to the transition from in-situ to accretion-dominated regions, and any inferred mass fractions are not indicative of the true accreted mass. Instead, these dips contain information about the galaxies' dry minor merger assembly history.},

	abstract = {We present the second data release for the {HI}-{MaNGA} programme of {HI} follow-up observations for the {SDSS}-{IV} {MaNGA} survey. This release contains {HI} measurements from 2135 Green Bank Telescope ({GBT}) observations and an updated crossmatch of the {SDSS}-{IV} {MaNGA} sample with the {ALFALFA} survey. We combine these data with {MaNGA} spectroscopic measurements to examine relationships between {HI}-to-stellar mass ratio (M\_HI/M\_*) and average {ISM}/star formation properties probed by optical emission lines. M\_HI/M\_* is very weakly correlated with the equivalent width of Halpha, implying a loose connection between the instantaneous star formation rate and the {HI} reservoir, although the link between M\_HI/M\_* and star formation strengthens when averaged even over only moderate timescales ({\textasciitilde}30 Myrs). Galaxies with elevated {HI} depletion times have enhanced [{OI}]/Halpha and depressed Halpha surface brightness, consistent with more {HI} residing in a diffuse and/or shock heated phase which is less capable of condensing into molecular clouds. Of all optical lines, M\_HI/M\_* correlates most strongly with oxygen equivalent width, {EW}(O), which is likely a result of the existing correlation between M\_HI/M\_* and gas-phase metallicity. Residuals in the M\_HI/M\_*-{EW}(O) relation are again correlated with [{OI}]/Halpha and Halpha surface brightness, suggesting they are also driven by variations in the fraction of diffuse and/or shock-heated gas. We recover the strong anti-correlation between M\_HI/M\_* and gas-phase metallicity seen in previous studies. We also find a positive relationship between M\_HI/M\_* and [{OI}]/Halpha, independent of metallicity, which may suggest that higher fractions of diffuse and/or shock heated gas are more prevalent in gas-rich galaxies.},

	abstract = {The actual mechanism(s) powering galactic outflows in active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) is still a matter of debate. At least two physical models have been considered in the literature: wind shocks and radiation pressure on dust. Here we provide a first quantitative comparison of the {AGN} radiative feedback scenario with observations of galactic outflows. We directly compare our radiation pressure-driven shell models with the observational data from the most recent compilation of molecular outflows on galactic scales. We show that the observed dynamics and energetics of galactic outflows can be reproduced by {AGN} radiative feedback, with the inclusion of radiation trapping and/or luminosity evolution. The predicted scalings of the outflow energetics with {AGN} luminosity can also quantitatively account for the observational scaling relations. Furthermore, sources with both ultra-fast and molecular outflow detections are found to be located in the `forbidden' region of the \$N\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\} - {\textbackslash}lambda\$ plane. Overall, an encouraging agreement is obtained over a wide range of {AGN} and host galaxy parameters. We discuss our results in the context of recent observational findings and numerical simulations. In conclusion, {AGN} radiative feedback is a promising mechanism for driving galactic outflows that should be considered, alongside wind feedback, in the interpretation of future observational data.},

The depletions of different elements are tightly correlated, indicating a common origin. Hydrogen column density is the main driver for depletion variations. Correlations are weaker with volume density, probed by {CI} fine structure lines, and distance to the {LMC} center. The latter correlation results from an East-West variation of the gas-phase metallicity. Gas in the East, compressed side of the {LMC} encompassing 30 Doradus and the Southeast {HI} over-density is enriched by up to +0.3dex, while gas in the West side is metal-deficient by up to -0.5dex. Within the parameter space probed by {METAL}, no correlation with molecular fraction or radiation field intensity are found.

Both simulations are in remarkable agreement in predicting a strong modulation of flow rate direction with azimuthal angle: inflow is more substantial along the galaxy major axis, while outflow is strongest along the minor axis. The absolute rates are noticeably larger for higher (log(M\_* / M\_sun) {\textasciitilde} 10.5) stellar mass galaxies, up to an order of magnitude compared to M{\textasciicircum}dot {\textless} 1 M\_sun/yr/sr for log(M\_* / M\_sun) {\textasciitilde} 9.5 objects.

Our results present a global picture whereby, despite the numerous mixing processes, there is a clear angular dependence of the {CGM} metallicity. We make forecasts for future large survey programs that will be able to compare against these expectations.

Self-gravity preserves the densest clouds way past their \${\textbackslash}sim 15{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Myr\}\$ cloud crushing time scales. This model could provides a plausible in-situ origin for the observed molecular gas. Warm ionised gas is also generated, almost independent of the cloud density. The amount solely depend on the magnetic field configuration in the wind. For low density clouds (\$0.1{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$), the forming warm ionised gas can be as much as 60 per cent of the initially atomic cloud mass.

	abstract = {State-of-the-art cosmological simulations on classical computers are limited by time, energy, and memory usage. Quantum computers can perform some calculations exponentially faster than classical computers, using exponentially less energy and memory, and may enable extremely large simulations that accurately capture the whole dynamic range of structure in the Universe within statistically representative cosmic volumes. However, not all computational tasks exhibit a `quantum advantage'. Quantum circuits act linearly on quantum states, so nonlinearities (e.g. self-gravity in cosmological simulations) pose a significant challenge. Here we outline one potential approach to overcome this challenge and solve the (nonlinear) Schrodinger-Poisson equations for the evolution of self-gravitating dark matter, based on a hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithm framework (Lubasch 2020). We demonstrate the method with a proof-of-concept mock quantum simulation, envisioning a future where quantum computers will one day lead simulations of dark matter.},

	abstract = {An analytical chemical evolution model is constructed to investigate the radial distribution of gas-phase and stellar metallicity for star-forming galaxies. By means of the model, the gas-phase and stellar metallicity can be obtained from the stellar-to-gas mass ratio. Both the gas inflow and outflow processes play an important role in building the final gas-phase metallicity, and there exists degeneracy effect between the gas inflow and outflow rates for star-forming galaxies. On the other hand, stellar metallicity is more sensitive to the gas outflow rate than to the gas inflow rate, and this helps to break the parameter degeneracy for star-forming galaxies. We apply this analysis method to the nearby disc galaxy M{\textbackslash},101 and adopting the classical \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ methodology to explore the influence of model parameters on the resulted metallicity. It can be found that the combination of gas-phase and stellar metallicity is indeed more effective for constraining the gas inflow and outflow rates. Our results also show that the model with relatively strong gas outflows but weak gas inflow describes the evolution of M{\textbackslash},101 reasonably well.},

In order to understand the dynamical evolution of star clusters in their early phase, in which star clusters are still embedded in their surrounding gas, we need an accurate integration of individual stellar orbits without gravitational softening in the systems including both gas and stars, as well as modeling individual stars with a realistic mass function. We develop a new tree-direct hybrid smoothed particle hydrodynamics/N-body code, {ASURA}+{BRIDGE}, in which stars are integrated using a direct \$N\$-body scheme or {PeTar}, a particle-particle particle-tree scheme code, without gravitational softening. In {ASURA}+{BRIDGE}, stars are assumed to have masses randomly drawn from a given initial mass function. With this code, we perform star-cluster formation simulations starting from molecular clouds without gravitational softening. We find that artificial dense cores in star-cluster centers due to the softening disappear when we do not use softening. We further demonstrate that star clusters are built up via mergers of smaller clumps. Star clusters formed in our simulations include some dynamically formed binaries with semi-major axes of a few to 100 au, and the binary fraction is higher for more massive stars.},

We characterize its {CGM} with two background {QSOs} at impact parameters of 93 kpc and 176 kpc. We detect strong {HI} and metal-line absorption near the redshift of the {SMG} towards both {QSOs}, each consisting of three main subsystems spanning over 1500 km/s. The absorbers show remarkable kinematic and metallicity coherence across a separation of 86 kpc. In particular, the cool gas in the {CGM} of the {SMG} exhibits high {HI} column densities (\${\textbackslash}log N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {HI}\}/\{{\textbackslash}rm cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} = 20.2, 18.6\$), low metallicities ([M/H] \${\textbackslash}approx\$ -2.0), and similar radial velocities (\${\textbackslash}approx\$ -300 km/s). While the {HI} column densities match previous results on the {CGM} around {QSOs} at z {\textgreater} 2, the metallicities are lower by more than an order-of-magnitude. The large physical extent, the velocity coherence, the high surface density, and the low metallicity are all consistent with the cool, inflowing, and near-pristine gas streams predicted to penetrate hot massive halos at z {\textgreater} 1.5. We estimate a total gas accretion rate of {\textasciitilde}100 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$/yr from three such streams, which falls short of the star formation rate but is consistent with simulations. At this rate, it takes about a billion years to acquire the molecular gas reservoir of the central starburst.},

Most recently, the {CHANG}-{ES} collaboration (Continuum {HAlos} in Nearby Galaxies - an {EVLA} Survey) investigated in detail the radio halos of 35 nearby edge-on spiral galaxies and detected large scale magnetic fields in 16 of them. We used the {CHANG}-{ES} radio polarization data to create Rotation Measure ({RM}) maps for all galaxies in the sample and stack them with the aim to amplify any underlying universal toroidal magnetic field pattern in the halo above and below the disk of the galaxy. We discovered a large-scale magnetic field in the central region of the stacked galaxy profile, attributable to an axial electric current that universally outflows from the center both above and below the plane of the disk. A similar symmetry-breaking has also been observed in astrophysical jets but never before in galaxy halos. This is an indication that galaxy halo magnetic fields are probably not generated by pure ideal magnetohydrodynamic ({MHD}) processes in the central regions of galaxies. One such promising physical mechanism is the Cosmic Battery operating in the innermost accretion disk around the central supermassive black hole. We anticipate that our discovery will stimulate a more general discussion on the origin of astrophysical magnetic fields.},

Our high \${\textbackslash}approx0.3\$'' spatial resolution allow us to study the relationships between [{CII}] line emission, star formation rate ({SFR}), and far-infrared ({FIR}) emission on spatial scales of \${\textbackslash}sim2\$ kpc. In the central \${\textbackslash}sim\$4 kpc of {HZ}4, the [{CII}]/{FIR} ratio is \${\textbackslash}sim3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ on global scales as well as on spatially-resolved scales of \${\textbackslash}sim\$2 kpc, comparable to the ratio observed in local moderate starburst galaxies such as M82 or M83. For the first time in an individual normal galaxy at this redshift, we find evidence for outflowing gas from the central star-forming region in the direction of the minor-axis of the galaxy. The projected velocity of the outflow is \${\textbackslash}sim400\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, and the neutral gas mass outflow rate is \${\textbackslash}sim3-6\$ times higher than the {SFR} in the central region. Finally, we detect a diffuse component of [{CII}] emission, or "[{CII}]-halo", that extends beyond the star-forming disk and has a size of \${\textbackslash}sim12\$ kpc in diameter. Most likely the outflow, which has a velocity approximately half the escape velocity of the system, is in part responsible for fueling the [{CII}] extended emission. Together with the kinematic analysis of {HZ}4 (presented in a forthcoming paper), the analysis supports that {HZ}4 is a typical star-forming disk at \$z{\textbackslash}sim5\$ with interstellar medium ({ISM}) conditions similar to present-day galaxies forming stars at a similar level, driving a galactic outflow that may already play a role in its evolution.},

	abstract = {We study the minimal 'bathtub' toy model as a tool for capturing key processes of galaxy evolution and identifying robust successes and challenges in reproducing high-z observations. The source and sink terms of the continuity equations for gas and stars are expressed in simple terms from first principles. The assumed dependence of star formation rate ({SFR}) on gas mass self-regulates the system into a unique asymptotic behaviour, which is approximated by an analytic quasi-steady-state ({QSS}) solution. We address the validity of the {QSS} at different epochs independent of earlier conditions. At high z, where the accretion is gaseous, the specific {SFR} ({sSFR}) is predicted to be {sSFR} ≃ [(1 + z)/3]$^{\textrm{5/2}}$ Gyr$^{\textrm{-1}}$, slightly above the cosmological specific accretion rate, as observed at z = 3-8. The gas fraction is expected to decline slowly, and the observations constrain the {SFR} efficiency per dynamical time to ε ≃ 0.02. The stellarto- virial mass ratio f{\textless}inf{\textgreater}sv{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is predicted to be constant in time, and the observed value requires an outflow mass-loading factor n ≃ 1-3, depending on the penetration efficiency of gas into the galaxy. However, at z {\textasciitilde} 2, where stars are also accreted through mergers, there is a conflict between model and observations. The model that maximizes the {sSFR}, with the outflows fully recycled, underestimates the {sSFR} by a factor of {\textasciitilde}3 and overestimates f{\textless}inf{\textgreater}sv{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. With strong outflows, the model can match the observed f{\textless}inf{\textgreater}sv{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} but then it underestimates the {sSFR} by an order of magnitude. We discuss potential remedies including a bias due to the exclusion of quenched galaxies.},

The morphology, luminosities, temperatures, and densities indicate that the emission comes from shocked material, and the O/Fe ratio implies that the X-ray emitting gas is enriched by Type {II} supernovae. If so, the speed inferred from simple shock models is about 500 km/s, which is sufficient to escape the galaxy. However, the inferred kinetic energy in the wind from visible components is substantially smaller than canonical hot superwind models.},

This paper presents the first Data Release, consisting of {\textasciitilde}20\% of the final {GASS} sample. We use this data set to explore the main scaling relations of {HI} gas fraction with galaxy structure and {NUV}-r colour. A large fraction ({\textasciitilde}60\%) of the galaxies in our sample are detected in {HI}. We find that the atomic gas fraction decreases strongly with stellar mass, stellar surface mass density and {NUV}-r colour, but is only weakly correlated with galaxy bulge-to-disk ratio (as measured by the concentration index of the r-band light). We also find that the fraction of galaxies with significant (more than a few percent) {HI} decreases sharply above a characteristic stellar surface mass density of 10{\textasciicircum}8.5 Msun kpc{\textasciicircum}-2. The fraction of gas-rich galaxies decreases much more smoothly with stellar mass. One of the key goals of {GASS} is to identify and quantify the incidence of galaxies that are transitioning between the blue, star-forming cloud and the red sequence of passively-evolving galaxies. Likely transition candidates can be identified as outliers from the mean scaling relations between gas fraction and other galaxy properties. [abridged]},

({III}) Near pericentre, the streams dissipate into an irregular rotating ring extending to {\textasciitilde}0.3Rv and tilted relative to the inner disc. Torques exerted partly by the disc make the ring gas lose {AM}, spiral in, and settle into the disc within one orbit. The ring is observable with 30 per cent probability as a damped Lyman α absorber.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10697},
	abstract = {Globular clusters can form inside their host galaxies at high redshift when gas densities were higher and gas-rich mergers were common. They can also form inside lower-mass galaxies that have since been accreted and tidally disrupted, leaving their globular cluster complement bound to higher-mass halos. We argue that the age-metallicity-specific orbital energy relation in a galaxy's globular cluster system can be used to identify its origin. Gas-rich mergers should produce tightly bound systems in which metal-rich clusters are younger than metal-poor clusters. Globular clusters formed in massive disks and then scattered into a halo should have no relationship between age and specific orbital energy. Accreted globular clusters should produce weakly bound systems in which age and metallicity are correlated with each other but inversely correlated with specific orbital energy. We use precise relative ages, self-consistent metallicities, and space-based proper motion-informed orbits to show that the Milky Way's metal-poor globular cluster system lies in a plane in age-metallicity-specific orbital energy space. We find that relatively young or metal-poor globular clusters are weakly bound to the Milky Way, while relatively old or metal-rich globular clusters are tightly bound to the Galaxy. While metal-rich globular clusters may be formed either in situ or ex situ, our results suggest that metal-poor clusters formed outside of the Milky Way in now-disrupted dwarf galaxies. We predict that this relationship between age, metallicity, and specific orbital energy in a \$L{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$ galaxy's globular cluster system is a natural outcome of galaxy formation in a \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} universe.},

profiles using Monte-Carlo radiative transfer ({MCRT}) modelling, we use both
multiphase, clumpy models and shell models and successfully reproduced the
diverse Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ morphologies with reasonable physical parameters.
Significant correlations exist between parameters of two different models, and
our multiphase, clumpy model parameters naturally alleviated the previously
reported discrepancies between the shell model parameters and data. In
addition, we have modeled Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ spectra at different spatial positions
simultaneously, and we find that the variation of the inferred clump outflow
velocity can be approximately explained by line-of-sight projection effects.
Our results support the `central powering + scattering' scenario, i.e. the
Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ photons are generated by a central powering source and then scatter
with outflowing, multiphase {HI} gas while propagating outwards. The infalling of
cool gas near the blob outskirts shapes the observed blue-dominated Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$
profiles, but its energy contribution is likely to be minor compared to the
photo-ionization by star-forming galaxies and/or {AGNs}.},

	abstract = {Stellar streams record the accretion history of their host galaxy. We present
a set of simulated streams from disrupted dwarf galaxies in 13 cosmological
simulations of Milky Way ({MW})-mass galaxies from the {FIRE}-2 suite at \$z=0\$,
including 7 isolated Milky Way-mass systems and 6 hosts resembling the {MW}-M31
pair (full dataset at: https://flathub.flatironinstitute.org/sapfire). In
total, we identify 106 simulated stellar streams, with no significant
differences in the number of streams and masses of their progenitors between
the isolated and paired environments. We resolve simulated streams with stellar
masses ranging from \${\textbackslash}sim 5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}5\$ up to \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, similar to
the mass range between the Orphan and Sagittarius streams in the {MW}. We confirm
that present-day simulated satellite galaxies are good proxies for stellar
stream progenitors, with similar properties including their stellar mass
function, velocity dispersion, [Fe/H] and [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/H] evolution tracks, and
orbital distribution with respect to the galactic disk plane. Each progenitor's
lifetime is marked by several important timescales: its infall, star-formation
quenching, and stream-formation times. We show that the ordering of these
timescales is different between progenitors with stellar masses higher and
lower than \${\textbackslash}sim 2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}6 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. Finally, we show that the main factor
controlling the rate of phase-mixing, and therefore fading, of tidal streams
from satellite galaxies in {MW}-mass hosts is non-adiabatic evolution of the host
potential. Other factors commonly used to predict phase-mixing timescales, such
as progenitor mass and orbital circularity, show virtually no correlation with
the number of dynamical times required for a stream to become phase-mixed.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08295},
	abstract = {In this work, we study the evolution of the mass-metallicity relations ({MZRs})
as predicted by the {GAlaxy} Evolution and Assembly ({GAEA}) semi-analytic model.
We contrast these predictions with recent results from the {VANDELS} survey, that
allows us to expand the accessible redshift range for the stellar {MZR} up to
\$z{\textbackslash}sim3.5\$. We complement our study by considering the evolution of the
gas-phase {MZR} in the same redshift range. We show that {GAEA} is able to
reproduce the observed evolution of the \$z{\textless}3.5\$ gas-phase {MZR} and \$z{\textless}0.7\$
stellar {MZR}, while it overpredicts the stellar metallicity at \$z{\textbackslash}sim3.5\$.
Furthermore, {GAEA} also reproduces the so-called fundamental metallicity
relation ({FMR}) between gas-phase metallicity, stellar mass and star formation
rate ({SFR}). In particular, the gas-phase {FMR} in {GAEA} is already in place at
\$z{\textbackslash}sim5\$ and shows almost no evolution at lower redshift. {GAEA} predicts the
existence of a stellar {FMR}, that is, however, characterized by a relevant
redshift evolution, although its shape follows closely the gas-phase {FMR}. We
also report additional unsolved tensions between model and data: the overall
normalization of the predicted {MZR} agrees with observations only within
\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.1 dex; the largest discrepancies are seen at \$z{\textbackslash}sim3.5\$ where models
tend to slightly overpredict observed metallicities; the slope of the predicted
{MZR} at fixed {SFR} is too steep below a few \$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$.
Finally, we provide model predictions for the evolution of the {MZRs} at higher
redshifts, that would be useful in the context of future surveys, like those
that will be performed with {JWST}.},

	abstract = {The standard picture of galaxy formation motivates the decomposition of the
Milky Way into 3--4 stellar populations with distinct kinematic and elemental
abundance distributions: the thin disk, thick disk, bulge, and stellar halo. To
test this idea, we construct a Gaussian mixture model ({GMM}) for both simulated
and observed stars in the Solar neighborhood, using measured velocities and
iron abundances (i.e., an augmented Toomre diagram) as the distributions to be
decomposed. We compare results for the Gaia-{APOGEE} {DR}16 crossmatch catalog of
the Solar neighborhood with those from a suite of synthetic Gaia-{APOGEE}
crossmatches constructed from {FIRE}-2 cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass
galaxies. We find that in both the synthetic and real data, the best-fit {GMM}
uses five independent components, some of whose properties resemble the
standard populations predicted by galaxy formation theory. Two components can
be identified unambiguously as the thin disk and another as the halo. However,
instead of a single counterpart to the thick disk, there are three intermediate
components with different age and alpha abundance distributions (although these
data are not used to construct the model). We use decompositions of the
synthetic data to show that the classified components indeed correspond to
stars with different origins. By analogy with the simulated data, we show that
our mixture model of the real Gaia-{APOGEE} crossmatch distinguishes the
following components: (1) a classic thin disk of young stars on circular orbits
(46\%), (2) thin disk stars heated by interactions with satellites (22\%), (3, 4)
two components representing the velocity asymmetry of the alpha-enhanced thick
disk (27\%), and (5) a stellar halo consistent with early, massive accretion
(4\%).},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08185},
	abstract = {In the currently favored cosmological paradigm galaxies form hierarchically through the accretion of numerous satellite galaxies. Since the satellites are much less massive than the host halo, they occupy a small fraction of the volume in action space defined by the potential of the host halo. Since actions are conserved when the potential of the host halo changes adiabatically, stars from an accreted satellite are expected to remain clustered in action space as the host halo evolves. In this paper, we identify accreted satellites in three Milky Way like disk galaxies from the cosmological baryonic {FIRE}-2 simulations by tracking satellite galaxies through simulation snapshots. We then try to recover these satellites by applying the cluster analysis algorithm Enlink to the orbital actions of accreted star particles in the present-day snapshot. We define several metrics to quantify the success of the clustering algorithm and use these metrics to identify well-recovered and poorly-recovered satellites. We plot these satellites in the infall time-progenitor mass (or stellar mass) space, and determine the boundaries between the well-recovered and poorly-recovered satellites in these two spaces with classification tree method. The groups found by Enlink are more likely to correspond to a real satellite if they have high significance, a quantity assigned by Enlink. Since cosmological simulations predict that most stellar halos have a population of insitu stars, we test the ability of Enlink to recover satellites when the sample is contaminated by 10-50\% of insitu star particles, and show that most of the satellites well-recovered by Enlink in the absence of insitu stars, stay well-recovered even with 50\% contamination. We thus expect that, in the future, cluster analysis in action space will be useful in upcoming data sets (e.g. Gaia) for identifying accreted satellites in the Milky Way.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07722},
	abstract = {In a companion paper, we develop a theory for the evolution of stellar wind driven bubbles in dense, turbulent clouds. This theory proposes that turbulent mixing at a fractal bubble-shell interface leads to highly efficient cooling, in which the vast majority of the input wind energy is radiated away. This energy loss renders the majority of the bubble evolution momentum-driven rather than energy-driven, with expansion velocities and pressures orders of magnitude lower than in the classical Weaver77 solution. In this paper, we validate our theory with three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations. We show that extreme cooling is not only possible, but is generic to star formation in turbulent clouds over more than three orders of magnitude in density. We quantify the few free parameters in our theory, and show that the momentum exceeds the wind input rate by only a factor {\textasciitilde} 1.2-4. We verify that the bubble/cloud interface is a fractal with dimension {\textasciitilde} 2.5-2.7. The measured turbulent amplitude (v\_t {\textasciitilde} 200-400 km/s) in the hot gas near the interface is shown to be consistent with theoretical requirements for turbulent diffusion to efficiently mix and radiate away most of the wind energy. The fraction of energy remaining after cooling is only 1-{\textbackslash}Theta {\textasciitilde} 0.1-0.01, decreasing with time, explaining observations that indicate low hot-gas content and weak dynamical effects of stellar winds.},

	abstract = {Winds from massive stars have velocities of 1000 km/s or more, and produce hot, high pressure gas when they shock. We develop a theory for the evolution of bubbles driven by the collective winds from star clusters early in their lifetimes, which involves interaction with the turbulent, dense interstellar medium of the surrounding natal molecular cloud. A key feature is the fractal nature of the hot bubble's surface. The large area of this interface with surrounding denser gas strongly enhances energy losses from the hot interior, enabled by turbulent mixing and subsequent cooling at temperatures T = 10{\textasciicircum}4-10{\textasciicircum}5 K where radiation is maximally efficient. Due to the extreme cooling, the bubble radius scales differently (R {\textasciitilde} t{\textasciicircum}1/2) from the classical Weaver77 solution, and has expansion velocity and momentum lower by factors of 10-10{\textasciicircum}2 at given R, with pressure lower by factors of 10{\textasciicircum}2 - 10{\textasciicircum}3. Our theory explains the weak X-ray emission and low shell expansion velocities of observed sources. We discuss further implications of our theory for observations of the hot bubbles and cooled expanding shells created by stellar winds, and for predictions of feedback-regulated star formation in a range of environments. In a companion paper, we validate our theory with a suite of hydrodynamic simulations.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen deuteride ({HD}) is prevalent in a wide variety of astrophysical environments, and measuring its large-scale distribution at different epochs can in principle provide information about the properties of these environments. In this paper, we explore the prospects for accessing this distribution using line intensity mapping of emission from the lowest rotational transition in {HD}, focusing on observations of the epoch of reionization (\$z{\textbackslash}sim6-10\$) and earlier. We find the signal from the epoch of reionization to be strongest most promising, through cross-correlations within existing [{CII}] intensity mapping surveys. While the signal we predict is out of reach for current-generation projects, planned future improvements should be able to detect reionization-era {HD} without any additional observations, and would help to constrain the properties of the star-forming galaxies thought to play a key role in reionization. We also investigate several avenues for measuring {HD} during "cosmic dawn" (\$z{\textbackslash}sim10-30\$), a period in which {HD} could provide one of the only complementary observables to 21\${\textbackslash},\$cm intensity maps. We conclude that existing and planned facilities are poorly matched to the specifications desirable for a significant detection, though such a measurement may be achievable with sustained future effort. Finally, we explain why {HD} intensity mapping of the intergalactic medium during the cosmic dark ages (\$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim 30\$) appears to be out of reach of any conceivable experiment.},

We study the radial transport of material within the disc plane in a series of concentric rings. For the gas in each ring at a given time we compute two quantities as a function of time and radius: 1) the radial bulk flow of the gas; and 2) the radial spread of the gas relative to the bulk flow. Averaging the data from all the halos, we find that the radial spread increases with radius in the form of a power law with strong secondary dependencies on the fraction of accreted material and the local radial velocity dispersion of the gas. We find that the bulk motion of gas is well described in the inner disc regions by a radially-independent mean inward flow speed of \$-\$2.4 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. The spread around this value relates to the change in angular momentum of the gas and also the amount of accreted material. These scalings from fully cosmological, {MHD} simulations of galaxy formation can then be used in semi-analytic models to better parameterise the radial flow of gas in discs.},

In fact, we find that all matter has a higher spin parameter when measured at accretion than when averaged over the entire halo lifetime, and is well characterized by λ {\textasciitilde} 0.1, at accretion. Combined with the fact that cold flow
gas spends a relatively short time (1-2 dynamical times) in the halo before sinking to the center, this naturally explains why cold flow halo gas has a specific angular momentum much higher than that of the halo and often forms "cold flow disks." We demonstrate that the higher angular momentum of cold flow gas is related to the fact that it tends to be accreted along filaments.},

well-resolved galaxy halos. We find that cold-flow streams and gas-rich mergers produce a circumgalactic component of cool gas that generally orbits with high angular momentum about the galaxy halo before falling in to build the disk. This signature of cosmological accretion should be observable using background-object absorption-line studies as features that are offset from the galaxy's systemic velocity by {\textasciitilde}100 km
s-1. In most cases, the accreted gas co-rotates with the central disk in the form of a warped, extended cold flow disk, such that the observed velocity offset will be in the same direction as galaxy rotation, appearing in sight lines that avoid the galactic poles. This prediction provides a means to observationally distinguish accreted gas from outflow gas: the accreted gas will show large one-sided velocity offsets in absorption-line studies while radial/bi-conical outflows will not (except possibly in special polar projections). Such a signature of rotation has already been seen in studies of intermediate-redshift galaxy-absorber pairs, and we suggest that these observations may be among the first to provide indirect observational evidence for cold accretion onto galactic halos. This cold-mode halo gas typically has {\textasciitilde}3-5 times more specific angular momentum than the dark matter. The associated cold-mode disk configurations are likely related to extended H I/extended {UV} disks that are seen around galaxies in the local universe. The fraction of galaxies with extended cold flow disks and associated offset absorption-line gas should decrease around bright galaxies at low redshift as cold-mode accretion dies out.},

robust expectations about the baryonic content of major mergers out to
redshift z {\textasciitilde} 2. First, we find that the majority of major mergers
(m/M{\textgreater}0.3) experienced by the Milky Way size dark matter halos should
have been gas-rich, and that gas-rich mergers are increasingly common at
high redshifts. Though the frequency of major mergers into galaxy halos
in our simulations greatly exceeds the observed early-type galaxy
fraction, the frequency of gas-poor major mergers is consistent with the
observed fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies across the halo mass range
M {DM} {\textasciitilde} 1011-1013 M sun.
These results lend support to the conjecture that mergers with
high-baryonic gas fractions play an important role in building and/or
preserving disk galaxies in the universe. Second, we find that there is
a transition mass below which a galaxy's past major mergers were
primarily gas-rich and above which they were gas-poor. The associated
stellar mass scale corresponds closely to that marking the observed
bimodal division between blue, star-forming, disk-dominated systems and
red, bulge-dominated systems with old populations. Finally, we find that
the overall fraction of a galaxy's cold baryons deposited directly via
major mergers is significant. Approximately {\textasciitilde}20\%-30\% of the cold
baryonic material in M star {\textasciitilde} 1010.5 M
sun (M {DM} {\textasciitilde} 1012 M sun)
galaxies is accreted as cold gas or stars via major mergers since z = 2,
with most of this accretion in the form of cold gas. For more massive
galaxies with M star {\textasciitilde} 1011 M sun (M
{DM} {\textasciitilde} 1013 M sun), the fraction of
baryons amassed in mergers since z = 2 is even higher, {\textasciitilde}40\%, but most of
these accreted baryons are delivered directly in the form of stars. This
baryonic mass deposition is almost unavoidable, and provides a limit on
the fraction of a galaxy's cold baryons that can originate in cold flows

	abstract = {Recent progress in constraining the massive accretions ({\textgreater}1:10) experienced by the Milky Way ({MW}) and the Andromeda galaxy (M31) offers an opportunity to understand the dwarf galaxy population of the Local Group. Using zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of {MW}-mass haloes and concentrating on subhaloes that are thought to be capable of hosting dwarf galaxies, we demonstrate that the infall of a massive progenitor is accompanied with the accretion and destruction of a large number of subhaloes. Massive accreted progenitors do not increase the total number of infalling subhaloes onto a {MW}-mass host, but instead focus surrounding subhaloes onto the host causing a clustering in the infall time of subhaloes. This leads to a temporary elevation in the number of subhaloes as well as changes in their cumulative radial profile within the virial radius of the host. Surviving associated subhaloes with a massive progenitor have a large diversity in their orbits. We find that the star formation quenching times of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{5\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\} {\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{*\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{7\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$) are clustered around the times of the most massive accretions suffered by the {MW} and M31. Our results imply that a) the quenching time of dwarf spheroidals is a good proxy of their infall time and b) the absence of recently quenched satellites around M31 suggests that M33 is not on its first infall and was accreted much earlier.},

	abstract = {Using our measurements of the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission line flux originating in the cool (T \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}4\$ K) gas that populates the halos of galaxies, we build a joint model to describe mass of the cool circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) as a function of galactic stellar mass (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\} {\textless} (\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_*/M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot) {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$) and environment. Because the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission correlates with the main cooling channel for this gas, we are able to estimate the rate at which the {CGM} cools and becomes fuel for star formation in the central galaxy. We describe this calculation, which uses our observations, previous measurements of some critical {CGM} properties, and modeling of the cooling mechanism using the {\textbackslash}cloudy modeling suite. We find that the mass cooling rate is larger than the star formation rates of the central galaxies by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 4 - 90\$, empirically confirming that there is sufficient fuel to resolve the gas consumption problem and that feedback is needed to avoid collecting too much cold gas in galaxies. We find excellent agreement between our estimates of both the mass cooling rates and mass loading factors and the predictions of independent theoretical studies. The convergence in results that we find from several completely different treatments of the problem, particularly at the lower end of the galactic mass range, is a strong indication that we have a relatively robust understanding of the quantitative effects of feedback across this mass range.},

We find that ∼70 per cent of the influx into the virial radius Rv is in narrow streams covering 10 per cent of the virial shell. On average 64 per cent of the stream influx is in one stream, and 95 per cent is in three dominant streams. The streams that feed a massive halo tend to lie in a plane that extends from half to a few Rv, hereafter ‘the stream plane’ ({SP}). The streams are typically embedded in a thin sheet of low-entropy gas, a Zel’dovich pancake, which carries ∼20 per cent of the influx into Rv. The filaments-in-a-plane configuration about the massive haloes at the nodes of the cosmic web differs from the large-scale structure of the web where the filaments mark the intersections of slanted sheets. The {SP} is only weakly aligned with the angular momentum ({AM}) near Rv, consistent with the fact that typically 80 per cent of the {AM} is carried by one dominant stream. The galactic disc plane shows a weak tendency to be perpendicular to the large-scale {SP}, consistent with tidal-torque theory. Most interesting, the direction of the disc {AM} is only weakly correlated with the {AM} direction at Rv. This indicates a significant {AM} exchange at the interphase between streams and disc in the greater environment of the disc inside an ‘{AM} sphere’ of radius ∼0.3Rv. The required large torques are expected based on the perturbed morphology and kinematics within this interaction sphere. This {AM} exchange may or may not require a major modification of the standard disc modelling based on {AM} conservation, depending on the extent to which the amplitude of the disc {AM} is affected, which is yet to be studied.},

extended reservoir of high angular momentum gas in the outer disc to

during mergers, thus expelling much of the gas which has lost its

	abstract = {Recent theoretical studies have shown that galaxies at high redshift are fed by cold, dense gas filaments, suggesting angular momentum transport by gas differs from that by dark matter. Revisiting this issue using high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulations with adaptive mesh refinement, we find that at the time of accretion, gas and dark matter do carry a similar amount of specific angular momentum, but that it is systematically higher than that of the dark matter halo as a whole. At high redshift, freshly accreted gas rapidly streams into the central region of the halo, directly depositing this large amount of angular momentum within a sphere of radius r=0.1rvir. In contrast, dark matter particles pass through the central region unscathed, and a fraction of them ends up populating the outer regions of the halo (r/rvir{\textgreater}0.1), redistributing angular momentum in the process. As a result, large-scale motions of the cosmic web have to be considered as the origin of gas angular momentum rather than its virialised dark matter halo host. This generic result holds for halos of all masses at all redshifts, as radiative cooling ensures that a significant fraction of baryons remain trapped at the centre of the halos. Despite this injection of angular momentum enriched gas, we predict an amount for stellar discs which is in fair agreement with observations at z=0. This arises because the total specific angular momentum of the baryons remains close to that of dark matter halos. We propose a new scenario where gas efficiently carries the angular momentum generated by
large-scale structure motions deep inside dark matter halos,
redistributing it only in the vicinity of the disc.},

important source of fuel for star formation at high redshift. However, the presence of such filamentary gas has never been observationally confirmed despite the fact that its covering fraction within massive haloes at high redshift is predicted to be significant (∼25 per
cent). In this Letter, we investigate in detail whether such cold gas is detectable using low-ionization metal absorption lines, such as C {IIλ}1334, as this technique has a proven observational record for detecting gaseous structures. Using a large statistical sample of galaxies from the {MARENOSTRUM} N-body+ adaptive mesh refinement ({AMR}) cosmological simulation, we find that the typical covering fraction of the dense, cold gas in 1012 M⊙ haloes at
z∼ 2.5 is lower than expected (∼5 per cent). In addition, the
absorption signal by the interstellar medium of the galaxy itself turns out to be so deep and so broad in velocity space that it completely drowns that of the filamentary gas. A detectable signal might be obtained from a cold filament exactly aligned with the line of sight, but this configuration is so unlikely that it would require surveying an overwhelmingly large number of candidate galaxies to tease it out. Finally, the predicted metallicity of the cold gas in filaments is extremely low (≤10-3 Z⊙). If this result
persists when higher resolution runs are performed, it would
significantly increase the difficulty of detecting filamentary gas inflows using metal lines. However, even if we assume that filaments are enriched to Z⊙, the absorption signal that we compute is still weak. We are therefore led to conclude that it is extremely difficult to observationally prove or disprove the presence of cold filaments as the favourite accretion mode of galaxies using
low-ionization metal absorption lines. The Lyα emission route
looks more promising but due to the resonant nature of the line, radiative transfer simulations are required to fully characterize the observed signal.},

We replace the conventional shock-heating motivated instant stripping with a realistic gradual prescription based on ram pressure and tidal stripping. We also carefully consider stellar mass loss in our model. When both mechanisms are included, the fraction of passive late types matches the data much more closely. However, the satellite over-quenching problem is still present in small galaxies in massive halos. In terms of the detectable residual star formation rates, gradual diffuse gas stripping appears to be much more important than stellar mass loss in our model. The
implications of these results and other possibilities, such as
redshift-dependent merging geometry and tidal disruption, are also discussed.},

measuring the angular momentum of the baryonic component, which is
populating the center of the halo, especially for disk galaxies. To test
this idea and to understand the connection between the angular momentum
of the {DM} halo and its galaxy, we use a state-of-the-art, hydrodynamical
cosmological simulation taken from the set of Magneticum Pathfinder
simulations. Thanks to the inclusion of the relevant physical processes,
the improved underlying numerical methods, and high spatial resolution,
we successfully produce populations of spheroidal and disk galaxies
self-consistently. Thus, we are able to study the dependence of galactic
properties on their morphology. We find that (1) the specific angular
momentum of stars in disk and spheroidal galaxies as a function of their
stellar mass compares well with observational results; (2) the specific
angular momentum of the stars in disk galaxies is slightly smaller
compared to the specific angular momentum of the cold gas, in good
agreement with observations; (3) simulations including the baryonic
component show a dichotomy in the specific stellar angular momentum
distribution when splitting the galaxies according to their
morphological type (this dichotomy can also be seen in the spin
parameter, where disk galaxies populate halos with slightly larger spin
compared to spheroidal galaxies); (4) disk galaxies preferentially
populate halos in which the angular momentum vector of the {DM} component

cosmology. We find that the cumulative mass distribution of specific angular momentum j in a halo of mass Mv is well fitted by a universal function, M(vμj/(j0+j). This profile is defined by one shape parameter (μ or j0) in addition to the global spin parameter λ. It follows a power law
M(0 at a fixed λ). Compared to a uniform sphere in
solid-body rotation, most halos have a higher fraction of their mass in the low- and high-j tails of the distribution. High-λ halos tend to have high μ values, corresponding to a narrower, more uniform j distribution. The spatial distribution of angular momentum in halos tends to be cylindrical and is well-aligned within each halo for {\textasciitilde}80\% of the halos. The more misaligned halos tend to have low μ values. When averaged over spherical shells encompassing mass M, the halo j profiles are fitted by j(M){\textasciitilde}Ms with s=1.3+/-0.3. We investigate two ideas for the origin of this profile. The first is based on a revised version of linear tidal-torque theory combined with extended
Press-Schechter mass accretion, and the second focuses on j transport in minor mergers. Finally, we briefly explore implications of the M(},

	abstract = {In this paper we analyse the statistics of the 2D gas-phase oxygen abundance distributions of 100 nearby galaxies drawn from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field spectroscopy Area survey. After removing the large-scale radial metallicity gradient, we compute the two-point correlation functions of the resulting metallicity fluctuation maps. We detect correlations in the majority of our targets, which we show are significantly in excess of what is expected due to beam-smearing, and are robust against the choice of metallicity diagnostic. We show that the correlation functions are generally well-fit by the predictions of a simple model for stochastic metal injection coupled with diffusion, and from the model we show that, after accounting for the effects of both beam smearing and noise, the galaxies in our sample have characteristic correlation lengths of \${\textbackslash}sim1\$ kpc. Correlation lengths increase with both stellar mass and star formation rate, but show no significant variation with Hubble type, barredness, or merging state. We also find no evidence for a theoretically-predicted relationship between gas velocity dispersion and correlation length, though this may be due to the small dynamic range in gas velocity dispersion across our sample. Our results suggest that measurements of 2D metallicity correlation functions can be a powerful tool for studying galaxy evolution.},

We validate the {SR} model by deploying the model in 10 test simulations of box size 100 Mpc/h, and examine the matter power spectra, bispectra and 2D power spectra in redshift space. We find the generated {SR} field matches the true {HR} result at percent level down to scales of k {\textasciitilde} 10 h/Mpc. We also identify and inspect dark matter halos and their substructures. Our {SR} model generate visually authentic small-scale structures, that cannot be resolved by the {LR} input, and are in good statistical agreement with the real {HR} results. The {SR} model performs satisfactorily on the halo occupation distribution, halo correlations in both real and redshift space, and the pairwise velocity distribution, matching the {HR} results with comparable scatter, thus demonstrating its potential in making mock halo catalogs. The {SR} technique can be a powerful and promising tool for modelling small-scale galaxy formation physics in large cosmological volumes.},

astrophysical simulations, including a dynamic procedure for the model parameter. We compare these two models directly to the common
Smagorinsky and dynamic variant. Using the mesh-free finite mass method as an example, we show that the anisotropic model is best able to reproduce the proper Kolmogorov inertial range scaling in homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. Additionally, we provide a method to calibrate the metal mixing rate that ensures numerical convergence. In our first application to cosmological simulations, we find that all models strongly impact the early evolution of galaxies leading to differences in enrichment and thermodynamic histories. The anisotropic model has the strongest impact, with little difference between the dynamic and the constant-coefficient variant. We also find that the metal distribution functions in the circumgalactic gas are significantly tighter at all redshifts, with the anisotropic model providing the tightest
distributions. This is contrary to a recent study that found metal mixing to be relatively unimportant on cosmological scales. In all of our experiments the constant-coefficient Smagorinsky and anisotropic models rivaled their dynamic counterparts, suggesting that the
computationally inexpensive constant-coefficient models are viable alternatives in cosmological contexts.},

The most commonly employed diffusion model, the Smagorinsky model, is known to be over-diffusive due to its strong dependence on the fluid velocity shear. We present a method for dynamically calculating a more accurate, locally appropriate, turbulent diffusivity: the dynamic localised Smagorinsky model. We investigate a set of standard astrophysically-relevant hydrodynamical tests, and demonstrate that the dynamic model curbs over-diffusion in non-turbulent shear flows and improves the density contrast in our driven turbulence experiments. In galactic discs, we find that the dynamic model maintains the stability of the disc by preventing excessive angular momentum transport, and increases the metal-mixing timescale in the interstellar medium. In both our isolated Milky Way-like galaxies and cosmological simulations, we find that the interstellar and circumgalactic media are particularly sensitive to the treatment of turbulent diffusion. We also examined the global gas enrichment fractions in our cosmological simulations, to gauge the potential effect on the formation sites and population statistics of Population {III} stars and supermassive black holes, since they are theorised to be sensitive to the metallicity of the gas out of which they form. The dynamic model is, however, not for galaxy evolution studies only. It can be applied to all astrophysical hydrodynamics simulations, including those modelling stellar interiors, planetary formation, and star formation.},

	abstract = {In the standard picture of disc galaxy formation, baryons and dark matter receive the same tidal torques, and therefore approximately the same initial specific angular momentum. However, observations indicate that disc galaxies typically have only about half as much specific angular momentum as their dark matter haloes. We argue this does not necessarily imply that baryons lose this much specific angular momentum as they form galaxies. It may instead indicate that galaxies are most directly related to the inner regions of their host haloes, as may be expected in a scenario where baryons in the inner parts of haloes collapse first. A limiting case is examined under the idealized
assumption of perfect angular momentum conservation. Namely, we
determine the density contrast Δ, with respect to the critical
density of the Universe, by which dark matter haloes need to be defined in order to have the same average specific angular momentum as the galaxies they host. Under the assumption that galaxies are related to haloes via their characteristic rotation velocities, the necessary Δ is ∼600. This Δ corresponds to an average halo radius
and mass which are ∼60 per cent and ∼75 per cent, respectively,
of the virial values (i.e. for Δ= 200). We refer to this radius as the radius of baryonic collapse {RBC}, since if specific angular momentum is conserved perfectly, baryons would come from within it. It is not likely a simple step function due to the complex
gastrophysics involved; therefore, we regard it as an effective radius. In summary, the difference between the predicted initial and the observed final specific angular momentum of galaxies, which is
conventionally attributed solely to angular momentum loss, can more naturally be explained by a preference for collapse of baryons within {RBC}, with possibly some later angular momentum transfer.},

	abstract = {The high redshift Lyman-alpha forest, in particular the Gunn-Peterson trough, is the most unambiguous signature of the neutral to ionized transition of the intergalactic medium ({IGM}) taking place during the Epoch of Reionization ({EoR}). Recent studies, e.g. Kulkarni et al. (2019a) and Keating et al. (2019), showed that reproducing the observed Lyman-alpha opacities after overlap required a non-monotonous evolution of cosmic emissivity: rising, peaking at z=6, and then decreasing onwards to z=4. Such an evolution is puzzling considering galaxy build-up and the cosmic star formation rate are still continously on the rise at these epochs. Here, we use new {RAMSES}-{CUDATON} simulations to show that such a peaked evolution may occur naturally in a fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamical framework, due to radiative suppression of star formation. In our best matching run, cosmic emissivity at z{\textgreater}6 is dominated by a low mass (M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {DM}\}{\textless}2.10{\textasciicircum}9\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$), high escape fraction halo population, driving reionization, up to overlap. Approaching z=6, this population is radiatively suppressed due to the rising ionizing {UV} background, and its emissivity drops.In the meantime, the high mass, low escape fraction, halo population builds up and its emissivity rises, but not fast enough to compensate the dimming of the low mass haloes. The combined ionizing emissivity of these two populations therefore naturallyresults in a rise and fall of the cosmic emissivity, from z=12 to z=4, with a peak at z=6. An alternative simulation, which features a later suppression and higher escape fractions for the high mass haloes, leads to overshooting the ionizing rate, over-ionizing the {IGM} and therefore too low Lyman-alpha opacities.},

We observe a direct kinematic connection between the cool-warm enriched {CGM} (traced by Mg{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}sc ii\}) and the interstellar medium (traced by [O{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}sc ii\}] in emission). This provides evidence for the existence of an extended disc out to tens of kiloparsecs that co-rotates with the galaxy. The Mg{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}sc ii\} velocity dispersion (\${\textbackslash}sigma {\textbackslash}approx 30-100\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, depending on positions) is of the same order as the modeled galaxy rotational velocity (\$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rot\} {\textbackslash}approx 80\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$), providing evidence for the presence of a turbulent and pressure-supported {CGM} component. We consider the absorption to be modulated by a galactic-scale outflow, as it offers a natural scenario for the observed line-of-sight dispersion and asymmetric profiles observed against both the arcs and the galaxy.

simulations of Milky Way formation, we investigate the origin of the
baryonic material found in stars at redshift zero. We find that roughly
half of this material originates from subhalo/satellite systems and half
is smoothly accreted from the intergalactic medium. About 90 \{\{ per
cent\}\} of all material has been ejected and re-accreted in galactic
winds at least once. The vast majority of smoothly accreted gas enters
into a galactic fountain that extends to a median galactocentric
distance of ∼20 kpc with a median recycling time-scale of ∼500
Myr. We demonstrate that, in most cases, galactic fountains acquire
angular momentum via mixing of low angular momentum, wind-recycled gas
with high angular momentum gas in the circumgalactic medium ({CGM}).
Prograde mergers boost this activity by helping to align the disc and
{CGM} rotation axes, whereas retrograde mergers cause the fountain to lose
angular momentum. Fountain flows that promote angular momentum growth
are conducive to smooth evolution on tracks quasi-parallel to the disc
sequence of the stellar mass-specific angular momentum plane, whereas
retrograde minor mergers, major mergers, and bar-driven secular
evolution move galaxies towards the bulge sequence. Finally, we
demonstrate that fountain flows act to flatten and narrow the radial
metallicity gradient and metallicity dispersion of disc stars,
respectively. Thus, the evolution of galactic fountains depends strongly
on the cosmological merger history and is crucial for the chemodynamical
evolution of Milky-Way-sized disc galaxies.},

	abstract = {We have used the {NIHAO} (Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects) simulations to explore how supernovae ({SNe}) affect star formation in galaxies. We find that {SN} feedback operates on all scales from the interstellar medium ({ISM}) to several virial radii. {SNe} regulate star formation by preventing condensation of {HI} into H2 and by moving cold neutral gas to the hot {HII} phase. The first effect explains why the cold neutral gas in dwarf galaxies forms stars inefficiently. The second maintains the hot {ISM} of massive galaxies ({HII} vents out at lower masses). At v\_vir ≳ 67 km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}, the outflow rate follows the relation: {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_out=23 (v\_vir/67 km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}){\textasciicircum}\{-4.6\} {SFR}. 20\{\{ per cent\}\}-70\{\{ per cent\}\} of the gas expelled from galaxies escapes from the halo (ejective feedback) but outflows are dominated by cold swept-up gas, most of which falls back on to the galaxy on a \{∼ \} 1 Gyr time-scale. This `fountain feedback' reduces the masses of galaxies by a factor of 2-4, since gas spends half to three quarter of its time in the fountain. Less than 10\{\{ per cent\}\} of the ejected gas mixes with the hot circumgalactic medium and this gas is usually not reaccreted. On scales as large as 6rvir, galactic winds divert the incoming gas from cosmic filaments and prevent it from accreting on to galaxies (pre-emptive feedback). This process is the main reason for the low baryon content of ultradwarves.},

	abstract = {We present gravitational-arc tomography of the cool-warm enriched circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) of an isolated galaxy at \$z {\textbackslash}approx 0.77\$. Combining {VLT}/{MUSE} adaptive-optics and Magellan/{MagE} echelle spectroscopy we obtain partially-resolved kinematics of Mg{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}sc ii\} in absorption. The unique arc configuration allows us to probe 42 spatially independent positions, covering the minor and major axes at impact parameters of \${\textbackslash}approx 10-30\$ kpc and \${\textbackslash}approx 60\$ kpc, respectively, plus \$4\$ positions in front of the galaxy. We observe a direct kinematic connection between the cool-warm enriched {CGM} (traced by Mg{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}sc ii\}) and the interstellar medium (traced by [O{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}sc ii\}] in emission). This provides evidence for the existence of an extended disc out to tens of kiloparsecs that co-rotates with the galaxy. The Mg{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}sc ii\} velocity dispersion (\${\textbackslash}sigma {\textbackslash}approx 30-100\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, depending on positions) is of the same order as the modeled galaxy rotational velocity (\$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rot\} {\textbackslash}approx 80\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$), providing evidence for the presence of a turbulent and pressure-supported {CGM} component. We consider the absorption to be modulated by a galactic-scale outflow, as it offers a natural scenario for the observed line-of-sight dispersion and asymmetric profiles observed against both the arcs and the galaxy. An extended enriched co-rotating disc together with the signatures of a galactic outflow are telltale signs of metal recycling in the \$z{\textbackslash}sim 1\$ {CGM}.},

The resolution of the simulations is high enough to resolve minihaloes and allow us to successfully pursue the formation of multiple Population (Pop) {III} stars, their supernova ({SN}) explosions, resultant metal-enrichment of the inter-galactic medium ({IGM}) in the course of the build-up of the system. Metals are ejected into the {IGM} by multiple Pop {III} {SNe}, but some of the metal-enriched gas falls back onto the halo after \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 100{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm Myr\$. The star formation history of the first galaxy depends sensitively on the initial mass function ({IMF}) of Pop {III} stars. The dominant stellar population transits from Pop {III} to Pop {II} at \$z{\textbackslash}sim 12-15\$ in the case of power-law Pop {III} {IMF}, \$\{{\textbackslash}rm d\}n/\{{\textbackslash}rm d\}M {\textbackslash}propto M{\textasciicircum}\{-2.35\}\$ with the mass range \$10-500{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$.

In contrast, for the case with a flat {IMF}, gas-deprived first galaxies form due to frequent Pop {III} pair-instability {SNe}, resulting in the suppression of subsequent Pop {II} star formation. In addition, we calculate {UV} continuum, Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$- and H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$-line fluxes from the first galaxies. We show that the James Webb Space Telescope will be able to detect both {UV} continuum, Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line emission from first galaxies with halo mass \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ at \$z {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10\$.},

	abstract = {A late end to reionisation at redshift \$z{\textbackslash}simeq 5.3\$ is consistent with observed spatial variations in the Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest transmission and the deficit of Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emitting galaxies around extended Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ absorption troughs at \$z=5.5\$. In this model, large islands of neutral hydrogen should persist in the diffuse intergalactic medium ({IGM}) until \$z{\textbackslash}simeq 6\$. We use a novel, hybrid approach that combines high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with radiative transfer to predict the incidence of strong 21 cm forest absorbers with optical depths \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{21\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ from the diffuse {IGM} in these late reionisation models. We include the effect of redshift space distortions on the simulated 21 cm forest spectra, and treat the highly uncertain heating of the pre-reionisation {IGM} by soft X-rays as a free parameter. For a model with only modest {IGM} pre-heating, such that average gas kinetic temperatures in the diffuse {IGM} remain below \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}{\textbackslash}simeq 10{\textasciicircum}\{2\} {\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash}, K\$, we find that strong 21 cm forest absorption lines should persist until \$z=6\$. For a sample of \${\textbackslash}sim 10\$ sufficiently radio loud background sources, a null-detection of 21 cm forest absorbers at \$z{\textbackslash}simeq 6\$ with {SKA}1-low or possibly {LOFAR} should provide an informative lower limit on the still largely unconstrained soft X-ray background at high redshift and the temperature of the pre-reionisation {IGM}.},

	title = {Constraining density and metallicity of the Milky Way's hot gas halo from O {VII} spectra and ram-pressure stripping},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02557},
	abstract = {Milky Way's hot gaseous halo extends up to the Galactic virial radius (\${\textbackslash}sim 200\$ kpc) and contains a significant component of baryon mass of the Galaxy. The halo properties can be constrained from X-ray spectroscopic observations and from satellite galaxies' ram-pressure stripping studies. Results of the former method crucially depend on the gas metallicity assumptions while the latter one's are insensitive to them. Here, a joint analysis of both kinds of data is presented to constrain electron density and metallicity of the gas. The power law is assumed for the electron density radial profile, while for the metallicity, a common-used constant-metallicity assumption is relaxed by introducing of a physically motivated spherical profile. The model is fitted to a sample of 433 (20) sight lines for O {VII} emission (absorption) measurements and 7 electron density constraints from ram-pressure stripping studies. The best-fitting electron density profile of \$n\_e{\textbackslash}propto r{\textasciicircum}\{-(0.9...1.1)\}\$ (where \$r{\textbackslash}gg1\$ kpc is the galactocentric radius) is found. The metallicity is constrained as \$Z {\textbackslash}approx (0.1...0.7) Z\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (subscript \${\textbackslash}odot\$ represents the solar values) at \$r{\textgreater}50\$ kpc. These imply a total hot gas mass of \$M {\textbackslash}approx (2.4...8.7) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, which accounts for \${\textbackslash}sim(17...100)\$ per cent of the Milky Way's missing baryon mass. The model uncertainties are discussed, and the results are examined in the context of previous studies.},

The goal of the survey is to unveil the Galactic population of short-period variable stars, including short period binaries and stellar pulsators with periods less than a few hours. Between June 2018 and January 2019, we observed 64 {ZTF} fields resulting in 2990 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ of high stellar density in {ZTF}-\$r\$ band along the Galactic Plane. Each field was observed continuously for 1.5 to 6 hrs with a cadence of 40 sec. Most fields have between 200 and 400 observations obtained over 2-3 continuous nights. As part of this survey we extract a total of \${\textbackslash}approx\$230 million individual objects with at least 80 epochs obtained during the high-cadence Galactic Plane survey reaching an average depth of {ZTF}-\$r\$ \${\textbackslash}approx\$20.5 mag. For four selected fields with 2 million to 10 million individual objects per field we calculate different variability statistics and find that \${\textbackslash}approx\$1-2\% of the objects are astrophysically variable over the observed period. We present a progress report on recent discoveries, including a new class of compact pulsators, the first members of a new class of Roche Lobe filling hot subdwarf binaries as well as new ultracompact double white dwarfs and flaring stars. Finally we present a sample of 12 new single-mode hot subdwarf B-star pulsators with pulsation amplitudes between {ZTF}-\$r\$ = 20-76 mmag and pulsation periods between \$P\$ = 5.8-16 min with a strong cluster of systems with periods \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 6 min.

	abstract = {Star-forming dwarf galaxies have properties similar to those expected in high-redshift galaxies. Hence, these local galaxies may provide insights into the evolution of the first galaxies, and the physical processes at work. We present a sample of eleven potential local analogs to high-\$z\$ ({LAHz}) galaxies. The sample consists of blue compact dwarf galaxies, selected to have spectral energy distributions that fit galaxies at \$1.5{\textless}z{\textless}4\$. We use {SOFIA}-{HAWC}+ observations combined with optical and near-infrared data to characterize the dust properties, star formation rate ({SFR}) and star formation histories ({SFH}) of the sample of {LAHz}. We employ Bayesian analysis to characterize the dust using two-component black-body models. Using the {LIGHTNING} package we fit the spectral energy distribution of the {LAHz} galaxies over the {FUV}-{FIR} wavelength range, and derive the {SFH} in five time-steps up to a look-back time of 13.3 Gyr. Of the eleven {LAHz} candidates, six galaxies have {SFH} consistent with no star formation activity at look-back times beyond 1 Gyr. The remaining galaxies show residual levels of star formation at ages \${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$1{\textbackslash},Gyr, making them less suitable as local analogs. The six young galaxies stand out in our sample by having the lowest gas-phase metallicities. They are characterized by warmer dust, having the highest specific {SFR}, and the highest gas mass fractions. The young age of these six galaxies suggests that merging is less important as a driver of the star formation activity. The six {LAHz} candidates are promising candidates for studies of the gas dynamics role in driving star formation.},
