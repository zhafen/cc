	abstract = {In the last decade, the photospheric solar metallicity as determined from spectroscopy experienced a remarkable downward revision. Part of this effect can be attributed to an improvement of atomic data and the inclusion of {NLTE} computations, but also the use of hydrodynamical model atmospheres seemed to play a role. This "decrease" with time of the metallicity of the solar photosphere increased the disagreement with the results from helioseismology. With a {CO}5BOLD 3D model of the solar atmosphere, the {CIFIST} team at the Paris Observatory re-determined the photospheric solar abundances of several elements, among them C, N, and O. The spectroscopic abundances are obtained by fitting the equivalent width and/or the profile of observed spectral lines with synthetic spectra computed from the 3D model atmosphere. We conclude that the effects of granular fluctuations depend on the characteristics of the individual lines, but are found to be relevant only in a few particular cases. 3D effects are not reponsible for the systematic lowering of the solar abundances in recent years. The solar metallicity resulting from this analysis is Z=0.0153, Z/X=0.0209.},

	doi = {10.1093/MNRAS/STY1247},
	abstract = {We present a detailed assessment of the global atomic hydrogen gas fraction in a sample of post-merger galaxies identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS}). Archival {HI} measurements of 47 targets are combined with new Arecibo observations of a further 51 galaxies. The stellar mass range of the post-merger sample, our observing strategy, detection thresholds and data analysis procedures replicate those of the extended {GALEX} Arecibo {SDSS} Survey ({xGASS}) which can therefore be used as a control sample. Our principal results are: 1) The post-merger sample shows a {\textasciitilde}50 per cent higher {HI} detection fraction compared with {xGASS}; 2) Accounting for non-detections, the median atomic gas fraction of the post-merger sample is larger than the control sample by 0.3 -- 0.6 dex; 3) The median atomic gas fraction enhancement (delta fgas), computed on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis at fixed stellar mass, is 0.51 dex. Our results demonstrate that recently merged galaxies are typically a factor of {\textasciitilde}3 more {HI} rich than control galaxies of the same M*. If the control sample is additionally matched in star formation rate, the median {HI} excess is reduced to delta fgas = 0.2 dex, showing that the enhanced atomic gas fractions in post-mergers are not purely a reflection of changes in star formation activity. We conclude that merger-induced starbursts and outflows do not lead to prompt quenching via exhaustion/expulsion of the galactic gas reservoirs. Instead, we propose that if star formation ceases after a merger, it is more likely due to an enhanced turbulence which renders the galaxy unable to effectively form new stars.},
