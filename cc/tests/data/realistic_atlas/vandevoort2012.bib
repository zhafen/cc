	abstract = {We present an analysis of the galaxy-scale gaseous outflows from the {FIRE} (Feedback in Realistic Environments) simulations. This suite of hydrodynamic cosmological zoom simulations provides a sample of halos where star-forming giant molecular clouds are resolved to z=0, and features an explicit stellar feedback model on small scales. In this work, we focus on quantifying the gas mass ejected out of galaxies in winds and how this material travels through the halo. We correlate these quantities to star formation in galaxies throughout cosmic history. Our simulations reveal that a significant portion of every galaxy's evolution, particularly at high redshift, is dominated by bursts of star formation, which are followed by powerful gusts of galactic outflow that sweep up a large fraction of gas in the interstellar medium and send it through the circumgalactic medium. The dynamical effect of these outflows can significantly limit the amount of star formation within the affected galaxy. At low redshift, however, sufficiently massive galaxies corresponding to L*-progenitors develop stable disks and switch into a continuous and quiescent mode of star formation that does not drive outflows into the halo. We find inflow to be more continuous than outflow, although filamentary accretion onto the galaxy can be temporarily disrupted by recently ejected outflows. Using a variety of techniques, we measure outflow rates and use them to derive mass-loading factors, and their dependence on circular velocity, halo mass, and stellar mass for a large sample of galaxies in the {FIRE} simulation suite, spanning four decades in halo mass, six decades in stellar mass, and a redshift range of 4.0 {\textgreater} z {\textgreater} 0. Mass-loading factors for L*-progenitors are eta {\textasciitilde}= 10 at high redshift, but decrease to eta {\textless}{\textless} 1 at low redshift. [continued in text]},

	abstract = {We study the properties of gas inside and around galaxy haloes as a function of radius and halo mass, focusing mostly on z= 2, but also showing some results for z= 0. For this purpose, we use a suite of large cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the {OverWhelmingly} Large Simulations project. The properties of cold- and hot-mode gas, which we separate depending on whether the temperature has been higher than 105.5 K while it was extragalactic, are clearly distinguishable in the outer parts of massive haloes (virial temperatures ≫105 K). The differences between cold- and hot-mode gas resemble those between inflowing and outflowing gas. The cold-mode gas is mostly confined to clumpy filaments that are approximately in pressure equilibrium with the diffuse, hot-mode gas. Besides being colder and denser, cold-mode gas typically has a much lower metallicity and is much more likely to be infalling. However, the spread in the properties of the gas is large, even for a given mode and a fixed radius and halo mass, which makes it impossible to make strong statements about individual gas clouds. Metal-line cooling causes a strong cooling flow near the central galaxy, which makes it hard to distinguish gas accreted through the cold and hot modes in the inner halo. Stronger feedback results in larger outflow velocities and pushes hot-mode gas to larger radii. The gas properties evolve as expected from virial arguments, which can also account for the dependence of many gas properties on halo mass. We argue that cold streams penetrating hot haloes are observable as high column density H I Lyman α absorption systems in sightlines near massive foreground galaxies.},
