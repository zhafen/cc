	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12777},
	abstract = {Using our measurements of the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission line flux originating in the cool (T \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}4\$ K) gas that populates the halos of galaxies, we build a joint model to describe mass of the cool circumgalactic medium ({CGM}) as a function of galactic stellar mass (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\} {\textless} (\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_*/M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot) {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$) and environment. Because the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission correlates with the main cooling channel for this gas, we are able to estimate the rate at which the {CGM} cools and becomes fuel for star formation in the central galaxy. We describe this calculation, which uses our observations, previous measurements of some critical {CGM} properties, and modeling of the cooling mechanism using the {\textbackslash}cloudy modeling suite. We find that the mass cooling rate is larger than the star formation rates of the central galaxies by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 4 - 90\$, empirically confirming that there is sufficient fuel to resolve the gas consumption problem and that feedback is needed to avoid collecting too much cold gas in galaxies. We find excellent agreement between our estimates of both the mass cooling rates and mass loading factors and the predictions of independent theoretical studies. The convergence in results that we find from several completely different treatments of the problem, particularly at the lower end of the galactic mass range, is a strong indication that we have a relatively robust understanding of the quantitative effects of feedback across this mass range.},

	abstract = {We study the feeding of massive galaxies at high redshift through streams from the cosmic web using the Mare Nostrum hydrocosmological simulation. Our statistical sample consists of 350 dark matter haloes of ≃1012 M⊙ at z= 2.5. We find that ∼70 per cent of the influx into the virial radius Rv is in narrow streams covering 10 per cent of the virial shell. On average 64 per cent of the stream influx is in one stream, and 95 per cent is in three dominant streams. The streams that feed a massive halo tend to lie in a plane that extends from half to a few Rv, hereafter ‘the stream plane’ ({SP}). The streams are typically embedded in a thin sheet of low-entropy gas, a Zel’dovich pancake, which carries ∼20 per cent of the influx into Rv. The filaments-in-a-plane configuration about the massive haloes at the nodes of the cosmic web differs from the large-scale structure of the web where the filaments mark the intersections of slanted sheets. The {SP} is only weakly aligned with the angular momentum ({AM}) near Rv, consistent with the fact that typically 80 per cent of the {AM} is carried by one dominant stream. The galactic disc plane shows a weak tendency to be perpendicular to the large-scale {SP}, consistent with tidal-torque theory. Most interesting, the direction of the disc {AM} is only weakly correlated with the {AM} direction at Rv. This indicates a significant {AM} exchange at the interphase between streams and disc in the greater environment of the disc inside an ‘{AM} sphere’ of radius ∼0.3Rv. The required large torques are expected based on the perturbed morphology and kinematics within this interaction sphere. This {AM} exchange may or may not require a major modification of the standard disc modelling based on {AM} conservation, depending on the extent to which the amplitude of the disc {AM} is affected, which is yet to be studied.},

	title = {The nature of the Eastern Extent in the outer halo of M31},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13067},
	abstract = {We present the first comprehensive spectroscopic study of the Andromeda galaxy's Eastern Extent. This {\textasciitilde}4 degree long filamentary structure. located 70-90 kpc from the centre of M31, lies perpendicular to Andromeda's minor axis and the Giant Stellar Stream and overlaps Stream C. In this work, we explore the properties of the Eastern Extent to look for possible connections between it, the Giant Stellar Stream and Stream C. We present the kinematics and photometry for {\textasciitilde}50 red giant branch stars in 7 fields along the Eastern Extent. We measure the systemic velocities for these fields and find them to be -368 km/s {\textless} v {\textless} -331 km/s with a slight velocity gradient of -0.51 +/- 0.21 km/s/kpc towards the Giant Stellar Stream. We derive the photometric metallicities for stars in the Eastern Extent finding them to be metal-poor with values of -1.0 {\textless} [Fe/H]phot {\textless} -0.7 with a {\textless}[Fe/H]phot{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde}-0.9. We find consistent properties for the Eastern Extent, Stream B and one of the substructures in Stream C, Stream Cr, plausibly linking these features. Stream Cp and its associated globular cluster, {EC}4, have distinctly different properties indicative of a separate structure. When we compare the properties of the Eastern Extent to those of the Giant Stellar Stream, we find them to be consistent, albeit slightly more metal-poor, such that the Eastern Extent could plausibly comprise stars stripped from the progenitor of the Giant Stellar Stream.},
